AB  - Too often, services fail poor people&#x2014;in access, in quality, and in affordability. But the fact that there are striking examples where basic services such as water, sanitation, health, education, and electricity do work for poor people means that governments and citizens can do a better job of providing them. Learning from success and understanding the sources of failure, this year&#x2019;s World Development Report, argues that services can be improved by putting poor people at the center of service provision. How? By enabling the poor to monitor and discipline service providers, by amplifying their voice in policymaking, and by strengthening the incentives for providers to serve the poor. Freedom from illness and freedom from illiteracy are two of the most important ways poor people can escape from poverty. To achieve these goals, economic growth and financial resources are of course necessary, but they are not enough. The World Development Report provides a practical framework for making the services that contribute to human development work for poor people. With this framework, citizens, governments, and donors can take action and accelerate progress toward the common objective of poverty reduction, as specified in the Millennium Development Goals.

AB  - This article explores the social construction of public space in the Central Area of Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. Using qualitative data collected from a survey of public spaces in the Capital City, the paper argues that the grand philosophy of ‘City As Public Space’ which permeated the master planning of the city and which itself was distilled from the nationalistic and egalitarian aspirations that conceived the new capital, have not been effected in its implementation. The paper posits that the cumulative effect of government effort to establish its presence in the Capital City ahead of the initial occupancy date resulted in the sidelining of public space development in the city centre particularly. The paper then concludes that this situation is detrimental to the proper functioning of the capital as the nation’s ‘public space’, basing its argument on the premise that public space is the arena for social intercourse in any society, more so in the culturally rich and ethnically diverse one like Nigeria’s.

AB  - One of Henri Lefebvre’s last essays, “Quand la ville se perd dans une me ́tamorphose plane ́taire”, published in Le monde diplomatique in 1989, is by far one of his most enig- matic. The title alone says bundles; an atypically downbeat Lefebvre is on show, two- years before death, dying like his cherished traditional city: when the city loses its way, he says, when it goes astray, in a planetary metamorphosis. This article mobilizes Lefebvre’s valedictory lament. It does so to problematize his very own thesis on “the right to the city”, especially in the light of recent bourgeois re-appropriation. The discussion tries to rework and reframe Lefebvre’s celebrated late-60s’ radical ideal, propelling it into the contempor- ary neo-liberal global context, negating it by moving beyond it, affirming in its stead a “politics of the encounter”. If a concept didn’t fit, somehow didn’t work, Lefebvre insists that we should always ditch that concept, abandon it, give it up to the enemy. So, too, perhaps, with the right to the city. The political utility of a concept, Lefebvre says, isn’t that it should tally with reality, but that it enables us to experiment with reality, that it helps us glimpse another reality, a virtual reality that’s there, somewhere, waiting to be born, inside us. A politics of encounter, I suggest, forces us to encounter ourselves, concretely, alongside others; it doesn’t make facile, abstract rights claims for something that’s now redundant in an age when planetary urbanization has become another circuit of capital.

AB  - Urban primacy emerged in many developing countries during the twentieth century. The author of this cross-national study applies generalized least-squares panel regressions of world-system position, level of economic development, and land area to a standardized urban primacy index. Although core nations remained stable, peripheral and semiperipheral nations became more primate from 1930 to 1970. The trend toward higher urban primacy among peripheral nations slackened dramatically in the 1970s. National city-size distributions clearly diverged in the twentieth century, and world-systems theory provides insight into the international influences that mediate internal urban processes.

AB  - This paper shows how the just city of Amsterdam came to live, celebrates its achievements and mourns its death. The paper suggests that an equitable distribution of scarce resources and democratic engagement are essential preconditions for the realization of a just city. Social movements of Amsterdam struggled hard to make their city just and they had considerable success. However, in the late 1980s, social movements lost their momentum and, in the late 1990s, neoliberal ideologies increasingly pervaded municipal policies. Whereas urban renewal was previously used to universalize housing access and optimize democratic engagement, it is now used to recommodify the housing stock, to differentiate residents into different consumer categories and to disperse lower income households. Part of the reason that these policies meet so little opposition is that the gains of past social struggles are used to compensate the most direct victims of privatization and demolition. Future generations of Amsterdammers, however, will not enjoy a just city.

AB  - Resistant performances in Athens have gathered momentum over the last year, transform- ing the fixed landscape of a city into a platform for negotiation and dialogue. The singular compelling imagery of ‘occupying’ as a form of resistance is its multiplicity of voices—the collective mobilisation of the ‘multitude’. Yet, the force and urgency of a collective resistance lies in the individual untold stories of its proponents. Rather than glorify the movement as a faceless entity, this paper embraces the daily stories, struggles and wounds of occupation, by using photographs. Resistant performances are connected with existing social conditions: austerity measures, mass immigration and ‘crisis’. Such narratives of globalisation and empire building are transforming central areas and traditional notions of Athenian identity, giving birth to a new street-level language that has twisted, innovated and filled in the gaps of a culture’s hegemonic discourse. The paper analyses both protests and specific examples of street art as visual markers of the shifting, complex discourses of power struggles, margin- ality and counter-cultures that establish a new reality that must be seen and heard. Key words: Athens, resistance, crisis, right to the city, visual sociology ‘If it is true that forests of gestures are manifest in the street, their movement cannot be captured in a picture, nor can the meaning of their movements be circumscribed in a text. Their rhetorical transplantation carries away and displaces the analytical, coherent proper meanings of urbanism; it constitutes a “wandering of the semantic” produced by masses that make some parts of the city disappear and exaggerate others, distorting it, fragmenting it, and diverting it from its immobile order.’ (de Certeau, 1984, p. 102) A city is a living organism consisting of the ‘hard city’ one can map through roads, buildings, public spaces and the ‘soft city’ of inhabitants,multiple belong- ings and imagining desires.1 The process of softening the urban fabric is the extent t

AB  - Working with the renown improvisational comedy group, The Second City, a professor found that improvisation could be just the skill today's managers need for continued success. Ivey Business School and Second City worked together to provide the skills of improvisation to Ivey students and the business community. It was discovered that not only does improvisation provide a way to understand what it takes to be spontaneous and innovative, but exercises used by actors to develop their skill can de adopted by business as a means to experience and enhance individual and organizational capacity to be innovative and responsive. To capture the expertise developed and to deliver it cost effectively, Ivey and Second City created a joint venture to produce an interactive management video that simulates workshops. The research revealed 6 key areas that if developed would contribute to a manager's ability to improvise: 1. interpreting the environment, 2. crafting strategy, 3. developing individual skills, 4. cultivating leadership, 5. fostering teamwork, and 6. assessing organizational change.

AB  - This paper presents a new computer model for city skyline simulation. It works by shaping medium and high-rise buildings to their best performance. This new tool was conceived to simulate and analyze cities where tall buildings are emerging on pre-existing urban schemes with irregular geometry and where inter-building spacing is proportional to the height of built blocks. The model is based on two main inputs, namely: the description of the network formed by land subdivision of the actual or irregular urban schemes, and the building regulations quantitative parameters based on solar obstruction angles and maximum usability rates. By combining data from these inputs, the computer model presents the dimensions of the building envelop for maximum profitability of each plot. That way the architect will immediately know the number of floors that leads to the maximum built area, for certain plots. In addition to this, the built blocks images are presented in the screen, as well as corresponding tables and Cartesian graphs. Furthermore, this model can also be used for analyzing city skyline for large urban areas. This analysis can range from a mere visual inspection of the variety of images built blocks will take under different legal constraints, to a more intricate analysis of how city skyline and built area, amongst others, are affected by different the regulations.

AB  - This paper reports results from an analysis of the relationship between the structure of the city-to-city network of global airline passenger flows and the interstate world system. While many scholars suggest that the broader parameters of the world system structure the urban hierarchy embedded within or articulated to it, others argue that the urban hierarchy is decoupling from the world system. The analyses show that there has been some modest convergence in the distribution of power in the world city system. Moreover, they suggest that the mechanism for this convergence is the upward mobility of cities located in the semi-periphery and the east Asian region. The paper closes by considering the implication of these findings for a larger understanding of the relationship between globalisation, the structure of the world city system and its articulation with the world system.

It is unclear whether these\ngeneralizations are applicable in socialist economies. In this paper, I\nargue that institutional factors have played key roles in shaping\nChina's city system, which is characterized by declining population\nconcentration across cities and by tremendous vertical (population\ngrowth of cities) and horizontal (addition of new cities) expansions.\nThe empirical analysis focuses on describing the size distribution of\ncities, estimating a multivariate model predicting the population growth\nof cities, and performing a logistic regression analysis of new and\nexisting cities. The findings underscore the effects of urban and\nregional development policies, socialist institutions, changes in the\nurban administrative system, and state and local government interests,\nand suggest that they as a whole are more important than economic\nfactors in explaining the attributes and changes of China's city system.

AB  - The world's great cities are important nodes in the world economy. Major theorists (Friedman, Sassen, Castells) conceptualize global cities as the command & control centers for contemporary global capitalism. The authors' research offers a view of the global system based on a careful examination of the relations & connections between world cities & how those patterns change over time. Formal network analysis allows the authors to interpret data on flows of airline passengers between the world's great cities for six time points between 1977 & 1997, focusing on the changes in network characteristics (especially centrality hierarchies & clique membership) for the entire global city system. Although New York, Paris, London, Tokyo, & a few other major European & North American metropolises dominate this urban hierarchy throughout the two decades, the network roles & positions of other places shift considerably. The article concludes that research on world city networks once again demonstrates that global urbanization patterns are characterized by the uneven development dynamic anticipated by world-system analysis. 1 Table, 58 References.

AB  - This is an empirical quantitative study that uses urban demographic data to identify economic change in cities. Unlike previous demographic studies, a strong theoretical framework is provided for the analysis. The research is designed and interpreted through Jacobs's theory of the city as economic process within the framework of Wallerstein's modern world-system. This is the first time Jacobs's theory has been subject to systematic inquiry over big time and big space. We create an inventory of 184 examples of Jacobs's "explosive growth" from 1500 to 2005 within the modern world-system. These results are interpreted in terms of systemic hegemonic cycles with first Dutch, and then British, and finally U.S. cities dominating the inventory lists. It is found that Dutch, British and U.S. city growth spurts are front-loaded in their respective hegemonic cycles: this is strong evidence of hegemony being created and initially sustained through and by these dynamic cities. This study makes a direct contribution to developing world-systems analysis, and in a short conclusion future research on ways of contributing to Jacobs's theory of the city are discussed.

Analysis of the various types of flows that bind cities to each other also allows for the theoretical creation of images of the world urban hierarchy because most intercity flows, except for e-mail & money transfers, are part of the "friction of space" & the hierarchical forms they generate.

AB  - For policy makers in New York City the functioning of the criminal justice system appears to be deteriorating. During the last few years arrests by police have dropped. However inmate population continued to increase for over a year after the drop in arrests.  In spite of the drop in court case, or case load per judge, the average length of time to dispose of a case continued to increase.  During this time, the total number of judges working in New York City increased, further dropping the average caseload. The importance of this topic lies in the resistance of the criminal justice system to change and the high total cost of the system. Recent policy goals of New York City management have been to reduce needed jail capacity by reducing both the intake of inmates and average lengths of stay. New York City officials estimated that by reducing the inmate length of stay by ten days savings of $108 million could be realized.

AB  - Historically, tuition and mandatory fee rates of all North Dakota University System (NDUS) institutions (except the 2-year campuses) have been less than their regional counterparts. Average tuition and fee increases at NDUS institutions were significantly higher than their regional counterparts in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, as a result, the gap between tuition and fee rates at all NDUS institutions, except the 2-year campuses, and their regional counterparts has narrowed significantly in recent years. At the 2-year campuses the gap has widened significantly since 2003-04 with NDUS two-year campus tuition and fee rates, on the average, about $660 more than their regional counterparts. Funding for the needs based state grant program has not kept pace with tuition increases and has declined as a percent of estimated tuition collections, from 2.19 percent of estimated annual tuition collections in 1989-91 to 1.82 percent in 2007-09. However, increases in state aid currently under consideration by the legislature could help begin to address this situation.

Rather than being a "regular" iteration in this cyclical, developmental pattern, however, the current transformations are reflective of the previous collapse and following re-emergence of a complex systemic structure. This argument is tested empirically using world system network data measuring linkages between major global nodes over a 500 year period.

AB  - {"The} human mind can understand truth only by thinking, as is clear from Augustine."--Saint Thomas Aquinas Saint Augustine of Hippo is one of the central figures in the history of Christianity, and this book is one of his greatest theological works. Written as an eloquent defense of the faith at a time when the Roman Empire was on the brink of collapse, it examines the ancient pagan religions of Rome, the arguments of the Greek philosophers and the revelations of the Bible. Pointing the way forward to a citizenship that transcends worldly politics and will last for eternity, this book is one of the most influential documents in the development of Christianity. One of the great cornerstones in the history of Christian thought, {"The} City of God "is vital to an understanding of modern Western society and how it came into being. Begun in {A.D.} 413, the book's initial purpose was to refute the charge that Christianity was to blame for the fall of Rome (which had occurred just three years earlier). Indeed, Augustine produced a wealth of evidence to prove that paganism bore within itself the seeds of its own destruction. However, over the next thirteen years that it took to complete the work, the brilliant ecclesiastic proceeded to his larger theme: a cosmic interpretation of history in terms of the struggle between good and evil. By means of his contrast of the earthly and heavenly cities--the one pagan, self-centered, and contemptuous of God and the other devout, God-centered, and in search of grace--Augustine explored and interpreted human history in relation to eternity.

AB  - City limits are to be seen not only as geographical and temporal boundaries but also as perceived and effective horizons imposed by social arrangements. Making use of both philosophical and fictional resources, Gail Weiss develops an inter?corporeal cartography of the city that explores how these horizons impinge on people's lives. Drawing on the work of Merleau?Ponty and Elizabeth Grosz, this paper moves from the demise of a ?dead?end street? as represented in G. Naylor's novel ?The Women of Brewster Street? to some critical individual turning?points in Virginia Woolf's ?Mrs. Dalloway? (for further discussion of the relevance of Virgina Woolf's work see Jeri Johnson, ?Literary Geography: Joyce, Woolf and the City?, City 4(2), pp. 199?214). One such turning point is the death, a suicide, of one of Woolf's characters who refuses to pay the price of adapting to the established rhythms of the city. That such constraints can be challenged is suggested, though in this case not entirely satisfactorily, by the architectural example of Peter Eisenham's Wexner Center for the Performing Arts in the city of Columbia, USA. Constraints, limits and horizons have, then, to be seen as also potential sites of opportunity, ?in?between? spaces, where social transformation is possible.

AB  - The World Development Report 2011 on conflict, security and development will look at conflict as a challenge to economic development. It will analyze the nature, causes and development consequences of modern violence and highlight lessons learned from efforts to prevent or recover from violence. Between two thirds and three quarters of the children without access to school, infants dying and mothers dying in childbirth in the developing world live in countries at risk or, affected by or recently recovering from violence. There are strong links between local conflicts, national conflict, organized crime and trafficking and gang activity, and several societies that have successfully addressed one form of violence have later seen other forms threaten their development progress. The key challenge is to build national institutional capacities, taking account of the balance between political realities and progress on social justice, and the need for carefully sequenced and paced reforms. Successful efforts to prevent violence have in general combined political, security and developmental efforts in support of objectives of citizen security, economic hope and inclusive and responsive governance. The ultimate goal of the WDR is to promote new ways of preventing or addressing violent conflict. The WDR will not attempt to come up with a universal set of prescriptions. By drawing on insight and experiences from a host of past and present situations, it will identify promising national and regional initiatives as well as directions for change in international responses, and discuss how lessons can be applied in situations of vulnerability to violent conflict.

NASCIO's "State IT Workforce: Under Pressure — A National Survey of the States" found that the current IT workforce is aging and facing retirement, but hiring freezes have left a dearth of new technicians to take the reigns. "Retirements from an aging state IT workforce have been a looming issue for the majority of the states, and a comparison of NASCIO's September 2007 [survey] findings and our current survey highlights that the recession has only delayed this inevitable tsunami of turnover," NASCIO Executive Director Doug Robinson said in a statement. Chad Grant, NASCIO policy analyst and author of the study, said states will have a hard time hiring enough new IT employees. "The inevitable wave of baby boomers that will leave the state workforce in the next five years has only compounded the challenges that exist for recruitment and retention of highly qualified IT personnel," Robinson said in a statement.

AB  - This paper examines three central sociological theories that attempt to explain the role of international development professionals in the global political economy. In particular, I assess the relative merits of world-system theory, world-polity theory, & poststructuralism through a discussion of my case study of the development profession in Honduras conducted in 1995/96. My particular case study (based upon in-depth interviews, participant observation, & archival research) reveals the shortcomings of both the world-system & world-polity perspectives, but, at the same time, indicates how these two paradigms are more complimentary than they are contradictory. Moreover, the poststructuralist approaches of scholars such as Arturo Escobar (1995) & Harold Perkin (1996) may be more useful in explaining the growing power of the development profession in the developing world. I conclude by arguing that development professionals play a much more central role in the emerging global political economy than most sociological theories would claim.

AB  - A modelling approach is used for studying the effects of population vaccination on the epidemic dynamics of a set of n cities interconnected by a complex transportation network. The model is based on a sophisticated mover-stayer formulation of inter-city population migration, upon which is included the classical SIS dynamics of disease transmission which operates within each city. Our analysis studies the stability properties of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) of the full n-city system in terms of the reproductive number R(0). Should vaccination reduce R(0) below unity, the disease will be eradicated in all n-cities. We determine the precise conditions for which this occurs, and show that disease eradication by vaccination depend on the transportation structure of the migration network in a very direct manner. Several concrete examples are presented and discussed, and some counter-intuitive results found.

AB  - The “Right to the City” is, for better or worse, a catchy phrase, and has been used with quite a diversity of often contradictory meanings. The article describes Lefebvre's own reading, a strategic reading, a discontented reading, a spatial reading, a collaborationist reading, and a subversive reading. It concludes with the suggestion of an alternate reading, a sectoral reading, consistent with the experience of the Occupy movement today. One should be careful which reading one uses.

AB  - Mounting interest in the global system of cities has led many scholars\nto portray large, world-class cities as control points in the global\neconomy. From this position, they govern global banking, finance\nand international corporate relations with the assistance of advanced\n\nbusiness services and telecommunications. While large cities have\ntaken on many global functions, recent research has cast them only\nas outposts in the global economy and pays little attention to their\nrole in regional and national economies. This paper explores the\nrole of five large US cities in regional and national economies.\nUsing primary trade data for five high-order business services, we\nidentify the extent to which these large cities trade with other\nlarge cities of the US urban system, smaller-sized cities, and test\nstatistically the effect that firm attributes and physical characteristics\nof the city system have on shaping the areal extent of large city\ninteraction (trade). The results indicate that: trade is consistently\nbiased towards other large cities; the size of origin cities is associated\nwith the size of destination cities; and, distance more so than destination\ncity size plays the dominant role in shaping large city patterns\nof trade.

AB  - Training and simulation applications in virtual worlds require significant amounts of structurally plausible urban environments. Procedural generation is an efficient way to create such models. Existing approaches for procedural modelling of cities aim at facil- itating the work of urban planners and artists, but either require expert knowledge or external input data to generate results that resemble real-life cities, or they have long computation times, and thus are unsuitable for non-experts such as training instructors. We propose a method that procedurally creates layouts of cities from high-level, intuitive user input such as city size, location and historic background. The resulting layouts con- sist of different kinds of city districts which are arranged using constraints derived from established models of urban land use. Our approach avoids the need for external expert engagement in the creation process and allows for the generation of large city layouts in seconds, making it significantly faster than comparable agent-based software and thus supporting the needs of non-expert creators of virtual cities for many applications.

We construct model to simulate the mechanism based on multi-agent system, the experiment results show that the distribution of a virtual city system can be generated by the mechanism. Further, we prove that the generated distribution of city system is corresponding to that of a real city system by validating with the Zipf law. The work can help to build the virtual city model.

They do not disagree that during most of their history, the regions and peoples of the world have been organized hierarchically and that there are differences that need to be explained. But they see the processes and relations that link regions and people together as the main factor that explains these differences. It is the differentiation and not the differences per se that constitute this volume's focus and, in its respective accounts, taking care not to privilege any one region or time period on the basis of its presumed special characteristics. Against this background the book is divided into three parts. Part one deals with places outside of western Europe and with times that preceded the establishment of the European-based capitalist world-economy. The articles in part two discuss the different aspects of the concept of hegemony and the establishment of domination as these apply to cities in the world-system. In part three the focus shifts back to extra-European zones where the patterns of transformation around cities under the aegis of capitalist world-economy are examined. This book constitutes an important addition to the literature on cities. By approaching cities from a large-scale and a long-term perspective, the contributors develop a historical explanation of some of the different patterns of development that affected particular cities in their interaction with the world-economy. This historical and holistic perspective represents an improvement over most of urban sociology, where cities or aspects of cities are studied in isolation from all contingent and contextual factors. This book can be used by scholars, graduate, and upper-division undergraduate students of urban history and sociology.

AB  - Recently the number of inhabitants of cities in China has greatly increased, but the urban-rural population ratio has not, so the growth of cities is less than expected. The historical background is outlined. There has been a huge increase in rural population; there are both traditional and colonial city systems; there have been a number of planning strategies since 1949. China's level of urbanization is low: the rank order and the regional distribution of cities is anomalous. Many cities have developed and rural towns may soon greatly increase in size. There are fewer towns than in 1949. Thus city structure is in a state of flux, and this is not recorded in the statistics. -D.J.Davis

AB  - For the past 20 years, researches using the lens of world system theory (and other global political economy perspectives) have come to a better understanding of many of the anomalies in urbanisation patterns across more and less developed countries that had befuddled researchers whose assumptions left out global sources of social change. Recently this line of research has moved beyond regarding cities as mere objects of global forces, also theorising about their importance as lynchpins in the spatial organisation of the world economy. In this paper we review some of the scholarship that emphasises large cities’ roles as important modes of production, consumption, exchange and control at the global level; we develop the argument that systematic linkages - economic, cultural, political or social-relational - among global cities are likely to reveal the spatial organisation of the world-system; we review our position that formal network analysis provides a most promising methodological framework for analysing and mapping global intercity linkages; and we present a map of the current world city system based on our network analysis of recent air travel among many of the world’s great cities. We point out that our analysis is very preliminary and provides only a rough chart of the world city system at one point in time, and the data requirements for more detailed world city system maps for several periods of time are imposing, to say the least. Nevertheless, such a project holds the promise of revealing much about the spatial structure of our world system, how it has changed; how it is likely to change in the future; and how cities’ populations are affected by these changes. Completing the project will probably require collaboration among researchers in different countries.

AB  - Agriculture is a vital development tool for achieving the Millennium Development Goal that calls for halving by 2015 the share of people suffering from extreme poverty and hun- ger. That is the overall message of this years World Development Report (WDR), the 30th in the series. Three out of every four poor people in developing countries live in rural areas, and most of them depend directly or indirectly on agriculture for their livelihoods. This Report provides guidance to governments and the international community on designing and implementing agriculture-for-development agendas that can make a difference in the lives of hundreds of millions of rural poor. The Report highlights two major regional challenges. In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, agriculture is a strong option for spurring growth, overcoming poverty, and enhancing food security. Agricultural productivity growth is vital for stimulating growth in other parts of the economy. But accelerated growth requires a sharp productivity increase in smallholder farming combined with more effective support to the millions coping as subsistence farm- ers, many of them in remote areas. Recent improved performance holds promise, and this Report identifi es many emerging successes that can be scaled up. In Asia, overcoming widespread poverty requires confronting widening rural-urban income disparities. Asias fast-growing economies remain home to over 600 million rural people living in extreme poverty, and despite massive rural-urban migration, rural poverty will remain dominant for several more decades. For this reason, the WDR focuses on ways to generate rural jobs by diversifying into labor-intensive, high-value agriculture linked to a dynamic rural, nonfarm sector. In all regions, with rising land and water scarcity and the added pressures of a globalizing world, the future of agriculture is intrinsically tied to better stewardship of natural resources. With the right incentives and investments, agricultures environmental footprint can be lightened, and environmental services harnessed to protect watersheds and biodiversity. Today, rapidly expanding domestic and global markets; institutional innovations in markets, fi nance, and collective action; and revolutions in biotechnology and information technology all offer exciting opportunities to use agriculture to promote development. But seizing these opportunities will require the political will to move forward with reforms that improve the governance of agriculture. Ultimately, success will also depend on concerted action by the international develop- ment community to confront the challenges ahead. We must level the playing fi eld in inter- national trade; provide global public goods, such as technologies for tropical food staples; help developing countries address climate change; and overcome looming health pandem- ics for plants, animals, and humans. At stake are the livelihoods of 900 million rural poor, who also deserve to share the benefi ts of a sustainable and inclusive globalization.

AB  - Exploration of the disposition of hazardous wastes produced in the core focuses on the process by which this "antiwealth" is transported to distant locations in the periphery. The extent of the hazardous waste stream problem is described, along with the political-economic forces involved in transporting waste to the periphery & the environmental/health risks created by these imports at their final destinations. Factors contributing to the hazardous waste stream include a decrease in ocean transport costs, the desperate economic situation of many peripheral nations, & rising costs of waste disposal in core countries. Various unilateral, bilateral, & multilateral proposals for dealing with the problem are described, along with obstacles hampering effective implementation of potential remedies. Suggestions are made for ways to close the "global escape valve"; however, it is contended that the likelihood of those who create & benefit from hazardous waste accepting responsibility for its disposal is slim as long as core countries continue to control the bulk of wealth produced in the world-system. 1 Table, 81 References.

AB  - Geography is widely viewed as the important determinant of city location. This paper empirically disentangles the different roles of geography in shaping the European city system. We present a new database that covers all actual cities as well as potential city locations over the period when the foundations for the European city system were laid. We relate each location’s urban chances to its physical, first nature, geography characteristics, and develop a novel empirical strategy to assess how the existing urban system surrounding each location (second nature geography) determines its urban prospects. First nature geography is the dominant determinant of city location until the sixteenth century. Second nature geography becomes important from the seventeenth century onwards, in a way that corresponds closely to predictions from new economic geography theory.

AB  - What, if anything, is the difference between "green" World System research a la Bergesen, Chase-Dunn, Grimes, Parisi and other WS scholars and -- on the other hand, the "green" work of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)? REFERENCES: (1) Journal of World Systems Research, vol. 3, no. 3 (1997) [Special Issue on the Environment] http://csf.colorado.edu/jwsr/archive/vol3/vol3num3.htm (and click from there) (2) UNEP, Global Environmental Outlook (GEO1 Report,1997), Executive Summary http://www1.unep.org/unep/eia/geo1/exsum/ex1.htm (and click from there) One main difference is that UNEP was there first and the World(-)System(s) school is a Johnny-come-lately, as far as "green" research is concerned. Bergesen/Parisi write (JWSR, vol. 3, no. 3 (1997), p. 364):  "The turn toward the environment in any number of  disciplines has resulted in the greening of this and that area of study. Now it is world-system studies turn. It is a little late; but better late than never." Major similarities include: (1) treating the world as an integral system; (2) seeing a conflict between environmental sustainability/protection and capitalist economic growth; (3) being keenly aware of global rich-poor (center-periphery) stratification and its relationship to the environment. Bergesen/Parisi  (in their introduction to the quoted issue of JWSR) point to some special features of green WS work, but these seem to me more like "ripples" than major differences with UNEP work.

AB  - There are many examples of aversion to the city and city life among classical anarchists, as well as of an exaggerated positive valuation of nature and rural life. This ?urbanophobia? is certainly simplistic; but it was or has been by no means the sole or even the most representative position in the course of the history of libertarian thought. In this text, I aim to show the complexity of libertarian approaches to the city in the 19th and 20th centuries, using as examples, respectively, the works of Élisée Reclus and Murray Bookchin. Additionally, and in a brief way, I also try to summarise what seems to be the utility of such a discussion for contemporary purposes, drawing inspiration and examples from the recent Latin American experience in terms of urban movements' spatial practices. All these contributions are examined considering three foci: (1) the opposition between city and countryside; (2) the (anti-)ecological dimension of urbanisation; (3) strategies for socio-spatial change.

The two principal socioeconomic factors which contribute to the problem of drought are the policy bias of African countries towards urban areas and the role of external factors. With respect to physical factors, the author draws attention to the results of studies on urban inadvertent rainfall and suggests that mesoscale rainfall forecasters could do more accurate work by incorporating the effect of urban climate in their models. In the domain of water resources management and agricultural development, moreover, the development of urban agriculture could be encouraged downwind. Bibliogr., sum.

AB  - This special issue of the World Development journal is part of a larger project aiming to explore new ways of engendering macroeconomic and international trade models both theoretically and empirically and to analyse any implication for specific macroeconomic policy questions. For example Seguino's article uses empirical analysis to show that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is positively related to gender wage inequality in contrast to recent work which suggests that income inequality slows growth. Elson and Çagatay's article explores ways of ensuring that macro-economic polices have social and gender justice as their central goal. Although some of the papers are very technical others are for a more general audience. The articles are divided into the following categories: 1. growth and trade liberalisation, 2. financial liberalisation, 3. supply response and household well-being in gender-segregated low-income economies, and 4. bringing gender analysis into economic policy institutions.

They are the dominant loci in the contemporary world economy, and the influence of a relatively small number of cities within world affairs has been a feature of the shift from an international to a more global economy which has taken place during the 1970s and 1980s. This book brings together the leading researchers in the field to write seventeen original essays which cover both the theoretical and practical issues involved. They examine the nature of world cities, and their demands as special places in need of specific urban policies; the relationship between world cities within global networks of economic flows; and the relationship between world city research and world-systems analysis and other theoretical frameworks.

AB  - Globalization has renewed interest in the place and role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (and their residents) has become increasingly tied to their po- sition in international ﬂows of investment and trade. Data on the branch locations of the worlds 500 largest multinational enterprises in 2000 are subjected to two broad types of network analytic tech- niques in order to analyze the world city system. First, 3,692 cities are analyzed in terms of three measures of point centrality. Second, blockmodeling techniques are employed to generalize further about the positions and roles played by cities in the system. These tech- niques are used to trace out the structure of the world city system, locate cities in the context of a global urban hierarchy, and explore the degree to which this diverges from a simple one-to-one matching of cities onto nation-states in the world system.

AB  - There is in introduction to explain "how the core tenets of the world-systems perspective could inform environmental sociology"(62). There is also some question-marks why world-systems theory, although building upon the work of Braudel (1972,1981) who did rely also upon natural causative forces in explaining the course of history, then turned into a political economy concentrating on capital accumulation and class struggles, neglecting environmental conditions. Still, what crucial insights can environmental studies gain from world systems theory? "Key secular trends", "Causes and effects of Cycles of Crisis", "A series of Key Actors" , "Peripheral Exploitation and its Mechanisms", "Structural Causes of Intra- and Interstate Conflict" and "Socialism and the Transition to Capitalism" are reviewed and, in general, found useful for helping to understand environmental problems.

AB  - Debates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.

Yet Scott is a bit too cautious, too deferential to the monster he's mapped. In this essay, I develop a more critical analysis of cognitive-cultural capitalism as the co-evolutionary culmination of planetary urbanization and technological change, in a ‘noosphere of neoliberalization.’ A new social physics is under construction with the planetary commodification and colonization of the global attention span.

AB  - This is the final report for a study undertaken by CSIRO to investigate the feasibility of undertaking an environmental asset management plan (EAMP) for Brisbane City Council (BCC). It is proposed that the EAMP is based on the ecosystem services that the natural assets provide to the community of Brisbane. Implementing ecosystem services as the basis for an environmental asset plan is difficult as not all services are created equal –no single category captures the diversity of what a fully functioning ecological system provides to humans. For all of these services to be included in an EAMP they need to be linked to an environmental asset and associated with ‘values’. This forms the context of the feasibility study. The four key questions to be addressed in this document and which create its structure are: 1. What are ecosystem services and how are they linked to natural assets, particularly in urban areas? 2. What is an Asset Management Plan? And where and how have they been applied in Australian local government areas? 3. What are the findings from the investigation? 4. What recommendations to BCC are there from the feasibility study? The recommendations from this document are based solely on the work undertaken for this project. The process used to distil these recommendations included (i) background knowledge of researchers; (ii) desk based literature search on what EAMPs are and where else they have been implemented, and (iii) interviews with key BCC officers. It is noted that there could be many other recommendations based on various other approaches. This feasibility study shows that undertaking an EAMP in BCC is seen as positive and the recommendations in this report will help facilitate immediate and long-term implementation.

AB  - This paper offers a reading of urban ruin through a personal experience: a visit I made to the Chernobyl site in October 2007—first to the destroyed reactor and then to the ruined buildings of Pripyat, using my own photographs as documents. The paper situates this experience in the context of wider representations of technological ruin and the city. Pripyat may not be a city, let alone a metropolis, but its scale as a ruin is unique in the post‐war period. In the West, the ruined city usually only presents itself in fictive representations: that is, in literature and film and not in the flesh, so to speak. Experiencing the ruins of Pripyat may invite thoughts about the value, or otherwise, of industrial ruin; its unprecedented scale invites an altogether different meditation on the ruin of the city as a whole and perhaps, too, of civilisation itself.

As this population group seeks identity and independence, they make decisions that affect not only their own well-being, but that of others, and they do this in a rapidly changing demographic and socio-economic environment. Supporting young people's transition to adulthood poses important opportunities and risky challenges for development policy. Are education systems preparing young people to cope with the demands of changing economies? What kind of support do they get as they enter the labor market? Can they move freely to where the jobs are? What can be done to help them avoid serious consequences of risky behavior, such as death from HIV-AIDS and drug abuse? Can their creative energy be directed productively to support development thinking? The report will focus on crucial capabilities and transitions in a young person's life: learning for life and work, staying healthy, working, forming families, and exercising citizenship. For each, there are opportunities and risks; for all, policies and institutions matter

AB  - China's urbanization has accelerated during the era of reform. While there has been real progress in urbanization, the process has also been skewed by several administrative measures designed to foster urbanization and economic growth. According to a popular view, as many as 70 per cent of China's administrative jurisdictions now come under the rule of urban governments. This must be an exaggeration given that many parts of China are still essentially rural. This article examines three measures - turning prefectures into cities (di gai shi), turning counties into cities (xian gai shi), and turning cities and counties into urban districts (xian shi gai qu) - that have contributed to "inflated urbanization." Five propositions budgetary, urbanization, regulatory, organizational streamlining and policy incentive - are discussed to see if the three measures have either originated from or have affected them. We find that while the regulatory observation is relevant only for the measure of xian shi gai qu, the other four propositions are useful, though to varying degrees, for understanding the logic of the changing "city system" in the past two decades.

During the initial phase of research for this eCAADe conference activity it turned out that a large number of city models has been created in the course of time for different reasons resp. purposes. Therefore a rich variety in the production of city models can be noticed. This working session on 3-D city modeling brings together experts focusing on different aspects concerning the creation and use of city models, such as data input, data structure, data storage and data quality. Also the definition of a perspective on the future of 3-D city modeling can be regarded as an important topic. In this paper a rough overview on the different submissions will be presented. Furthermore three blitz statements are incorporated as time was too short to produce a full paper. Both with the individual contributions as with this overview paper it is intended to present a knowledge-base to this working field. Finally, the start for a growing bibliography was made in order to support future work in this area.

AB  - In the Bronze Age, the regular use of copper and bronze required the existence of an organized international trade. These linkages were imbedded within a structure of core-periphery relations charcterized by a division of labor, with Mesopotamia and the Harappan being the core centers of accumulation in the third millennium b.c.(notwithstanding other core centers such as Egypt). Mesopotamia (with the main port cities of Ur, Lagash and Susa) could utilize its immediate environment (plentiful and reliable water supply, alluvial floods), and it could utilize hinterland sources of timber (Zagros mountains, Caspian area and Indus valley) to engage in a system of "unequal exchange" (90), an economic imperialism coupled with political expansionism (92). Trade in the Gulf reached a peak between 2000-1750 b.c., and then started to decline. This decline coincided with the decline of the other core center: Harappa. The story told is about as follows: growing urban centres and growing demand for copper led to deforestation; this, plus overgrazing, caused the silting of channels and irrigation systems needed for agriculture. During the "small scale oscillations to drier conditions" 1800-1500, in combinantion with tectonic shifts altering the course of some waterways, increasing aridity led to increasing salinity and a severe (103; numbers) decline in agricultural yields. Finally, this brought the trade in the Gulf, and urban accumulation, to a halt.

AB  - The phenomenon of globalization has renewed interest in thinking about the place & role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (& their residents) has become increasingly tied to their position in international flows of investment & trade. While some have suggested the appropriateness of network techniques for the study of the global urban system, few have effectively realized their application. Utilizing data on the branch locations of the world's 500 largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 1981 & 2000, we employ network analytic techniques to examine change in the structure of the world city system. First, we evaluate the more than 3000 cities that are knit together in the MNE-generated city system in terms of three measures of point centrality (viz., degree, betweenness, & closeness) at both time points. Second, we use these measures to answer a series of questions regarding the development of the world city system: (1) How extensively has the structure of the world city system been altered across the era of globalization? (2) Have power & prestige in the world city system grown more concentrated? (3) Have cities been decoupled from "traditional" political geography in the course of globalization? In answering these questions, we trace out the changing structure of the world city system & address key concerns in the literature regarding its evolution.

AB  - The real world is a three-dimensional (3D) space requiring that 3D geospatial information applications be developed in alignment with the observer's visual and perceptive habits. Particularly, 3D building model data are required in a wide range of areas such as urban planning, environmental protection, real estate management and emergency response. At the same time, the development of Web service technologies allows the possibility of the widely distributed 3D geospatial data on the web. 3D city building model with its related information is an important part in the construction of a digital city system, and has become a staple resource on the web nowadays. In view of the hierarchical representation of a 3D building model, an abstract of a 3D building model based on structure details is studied, and a novel representation approach named 3D transparent building hierarchical model is presented in this paper. This approach fully uses both the existing 3D modeling technologies and CAD constructing mapping data. By the spatial relationship description, structural components inside a building can be represented and integrated as hierarchical models in a unified 3D space. In addition, based on the characteristics of the 3D building model data, a service-oriented architecture and Web service technologies for 3D city building models are discussed. The aim of the approach is that 3D city building models can be used as a kind of data resource service on the web, and can also exist independently in various different web applications. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag 2010.

Burns, Byron L. Davis, and Edward L. Kick.  [Page 432]  Journal of World-Systems Research  INTRODUCTION  The "greenhouse effect" is the Earth's trapping of infrared radiation or heat. Physical scientists have linked the greenhouse effect to the emission of two primary sources, or "greenhouse gases"––carbon dioxide and methane. While this in itself is a naturally–occurring phenomenon, the amount of trapped heat has increased substantially along with heightened human production and consumption. In fact, the amount of heat trapped in the earth's atmosphere through the greenhouse effect has risen dramatically in the last thirty years, and has done so in rough proportion to the loss of world carbon sinks (most notably through deforestation) in that same period (Grimes and Roberts 1995; Schneider 1989).  Despite the apparent importance of these dynamics, there is relatively little social science theorization and cross–national research on such global environmental issues. There is especially a paucity of cross–national, quantitative research in sociology that focuses on the social antecedents to environmental outcomes (for exceptions, see Burns et al. 1994, 1995; Kick et al. 1996; Grimes and Roberts 1995). We find this condition surprising given the substantial initial work of environmental sociologists (Dunlap and Catton 1978, 1979; Buttel 1987) and the key role social scientists might in principle play in addressing such worldwide problems (Laska 1993). As a consequence, we propose and assess a perspective on the global and national social causes of one environmental dynamic, the greenhouse effect.

AB  - This paper extends the debate on the right to the city through the idea of the urban impossible. The starting premise is the fundamental and age-old question—what actually is a city, what do we want it to be and who should be involved in its making? The right to the city is not just a movement for material rights, but also the right to shape, intervene and participate in the unfolding idea of the city. Cities, then, are living organic, conflictual entities that are constantly remade and recast in thousands of ways through everyday encounters. In different moments, new possibilities for radically different cities open up. The city, then, is an unfinished, expansive and unbounded story. The urban impossible demands a much wider political imaginary to intervene in the unfolding story of the city and calls for a radical appetite for change to inform the work of urban researchers. The agenda becomes not so much about what the city currently is or what it was, but more about what it could become, what it has never been. I outline some directions that this kind of research agenda needs to take; in particular, the need to develop a broad critique of the urban growth machine and developing processes and mechanisms for more participatory and direct forms of urban democracy. This is the urban impossible: being simultaneously within, against and beyond the current urban condition. Like an Alice in Wonderland who has found herself in the city, we need to dream six impossible cities before breakfast.

The second section looks at the geopolitics of Great Britain as an imperialist power, and at the political-economic objectives of the post-colonial state. The authors show how markets, constructed by a hegemonic power, shape the nature of the post-colonial state apparatus. They also show how these markets penetrate peripheral areas and are affected by political events on the periphery and among major political powers. Finally the authors consider the unique role of markets in state-socialist societies, suggesting that markets are tailored to state-dominated social arrangements.

AB  - The paper argues that systems analysis provides an invaluable frame for many aspects of urban studies. Two uses of the systems approach are identified. First, there is the use of the approach to conceptualize the phenomenon of study such that the researcher's emphasis is on the nature of the interrelationships of the objects and the attributes of the system of interest on the one hand, and the study of subsystems of interest within an interacting whole, on the other. Secondly, there is the use of the systems approach to generate appropriate methodological tools for the analysis and description of urban spatial and functional structure. For these uses of the system approach, the concept of entropy, introduced from both thermodynamics and information theory, plays a significant role. Empirically, the concept is used to generate interaction patterns of the journey to work subsystem in Jos, Benue Plateau State, Nigeria, while certain indices of information theory entropy are used to unravel the nature and structure of these flows or movements of people. It emerges that the concept of entropy can be used in studies of urban spatial structure as an integrating concept provided that our terms are defined explicitly and unambiguously. © 1976.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between a city’s cultural policy and its style. Our attempt is to illustrate the influence of city government’s change in cultural policy on the development of city style of Kaohsiung city. Essentially, a shift in city style generally reveals the distinct specification of cultural representation of a society, within which morphology and characteristics of human society is exhibited. The purpose of this study is to examine the change in city style and aesthetic life of Kaohsiung city in response to the rebuilding of cultural policy since the shift in political authority from KMT to DPP in 1998. Through in-depth interviews, collection and analysis of documents and datas, we categorized the shift in city style in response to policy changes according to the feelings of city residents. It is discovered that the shift in style could be drawn into three aspects: the redirection of cultural policy, the change in city style, and the general public’s sense and attitude towards consuming behaviour and aesthetics. Our study provides analysis and interpretation according to the above-listed fields, as well as suggestions on the development of local cultural policy for future reference. After research and analysis, the following conclusions are drawn respectively: 1. Cultural policy has affected the reconstruction of "city style" of Kaohsiung. But on the other hand, since the period of reconstructing is still short, the change has not been significant. Therefore, the policy on building an "Ocean City" would likely remain a slogan at the moment, instead of having much substantial meaning to the city and its residents. 2. There is redirection of "city style" of Kaohsiung that has been different from those of the past. Points of "light" appear around the city. But since the period of change is still short, these "lights" have not formed eye-catching symbols that could represent this city. 3. There is still a sense of dissociation between city residents with arts and cultural life. The ability of city residents to decode the meaning of arts and culture is not strong. As a result, residents tend to be passive in their participation in cultural activities, but, interestingly, rather active in taking the consumer role. There has not been obvious changes in the cultivation of residents’ cultural, artistic, or aesthetic taste. Consumerization of public spaces and attempts to attract consumer behaviour have increased significantly.

AB  - World heritage city surveillance system using smart closed circuit television (CCTV) is a system that detects the movement around the monitoring area and then counts the number of tourists who enter and exit the word heritage city. The system has been developed to assist the surveillance system in the world heritage city (WHC) or restricted area through the CCTV camera in detecting the trespassers, when the WHC is closed. This data can be used not only for the surveillance purpose but also for the commercial strategic planning and the security community as well. For example, the number of participants, audience, or visitors who attend the event can be used to plan the upcoming event. In developing the world heritage city surveillance system using smart CCTV, the developers adapted the knowledge about image processing to detect and count the number of people-in and people-out from video data and to security for the system. The system was tested on three set of video data and the results reveal 80-90% accuracy rate. Most of the errors occur when the background area is dark or when people walk in a group but the ability to control critical analysis of communication data to the agency administrator can control the order to increase security for tourists and maintain the condition of the remains a world heritage site.

AB  - This paper engages with a recent set of critical arguments concerning the ‘post-crisis city’ and the political economy of ‘austerity urbanism’. The focus of the discussion is on practical inter- ventions in the vacant and disused spaces of recessionary cities, and in particular on tempor- ary designs and provisional uses. In this way, it opens a further line of argument about urbanism under conditions of austerity, alongside analyses of the formal politics of austerity or the possibilities of urban activism in these settings. Its concern is with forms of urban intervention that re-work orthodoxies of urban development as usual: in particular the timescales that inform conventional development models; the understandings of use around which sites are planned and designed; and the ways in which value is realized through the production of urban spaces. The argument centres on European contexts of austerity urbanism, drawing on critical examples of urban design and occupation in the region’s largest economies. Such urban strategies are concerned with a politics and a practice of small incursions in material spaces that seek to create a kind of ‘durability through the temporary’.

AB  - We tend to see contemporary cities through a peace?time lens and war as somehow exceptional. In this ambitious paper, long in historical range and global in geographical scope, Steve Graham unmasks and displays the very many ways in which warfare is intimately woven into the fabric of cities and practices of city planners. He draws out the aggression which we should see as the counterpart of the defensive fortifications of historic towns, continues with the re?structuring?often itself violent?of Paris and of many other cities to enable the oppressive state forces to patrol and subordinate the feared masses. Other examples take us through the fear of aerial bombardment as an influence on Le Corbusier and modernist urban design to the meticulous planners who devised and monitored the slaughter in Dresden, Tokyo and other targets in World War 2. Later episodes, some drawing on previously classified material, show how military thinking conditioned urbanisation in the Cold War and does so in the multiple ?wars? now under way?against ?terrorism? and the enemy within . City has carried some exceptional work on war and ?urbicide? but this paper argues that, for the most part, the social sciences are in denial and ends with a call for action to confront, reveal and challenge the militarisation of urban space.

AB  - Today's enormous development challenges are complicated by the reality of climate changethe two are inextricably linked and together demand immediate attention. Climate change threatens all countries, but particularly developing ones. Understanding what climate change means for development policy is the central aim of the World Development Report 2010. It explores how public policy can change to better help people cope with new or worsened risks, how land and water management must adapt to better protect a threatened natural environment while feeding an expanding and more prosperous population, and how energy systems will need to be transformed.The report is an urgent call for action, both for developing countries who are striving to ensure policies are adapted to the realities and dangers of a hotter planet, and for high-income countries who need to undertake ambitious mitigation while supporting developing countries efforts. A climate-smart world is within reach if we act now to tackle the substantial inertia in the climate, in infrastructure, and in behaviors and institutions; if we act together to reconcile needed growth with prudent and affordable development choices; and if we act differently by investing in the needed energy revolution and taking the steps required to adapt to a rapidly changing planet.In the crowded field of climate change reports, WDR 2010 uniquely: emphasizes development takes an integrated look at adaptation and mitigation highlights opportunities in the changing competitive landscape and how to seize them proposes policy solutions grounded in analytic work and in the context of the political economy of reform

AB  - City provides an accessible yet critical introduction to one of the key ideas in human geography. Always at the heart of discussions in social theory, the definition and specification of the city nonetheless remains elusive. In this volume, Phil Hubbard locates the concept of the city within current traditions of social thought, providing a basis for understand- ing its varying usages and meanings through a critical discussion of the contribution of major theories and thinkers. This book thus offers a distinctive and timely intervention in debates in urban theory by suggesting new ways that students and scholars in sociology, geography, urban studies, planning and politics can make sense of the city. Written in a lively and accessible style, the individual chapters of City offer a thematic overview of some important ways of approaching cities, whether as imagined realms, lived-in places, networks of association or spaces of flow. Situating these traditions within the rich heritage of urban studies and urban sociology, the book develops the argument that none of these approaches, when taken alone, helps us grasp the specificity of the urban, but that each is vital for grasping the materiality of cities.The book thus spells out the case for a renewed urban geography, suggesting that it is only by combining these different ways of approaching the city that we can begin to understand the relational materiality of urban life.

AB  - A review of the literature on the currently popular political economy approach to Third World development reveals three primary foci of analysis: (1) dependency on the world economic system; (2) the internal SC structure & SC struggles; & (3) the peripheral capitalist state. The basic ideas involved in these three approaches are examined, & an attempt is made to integrate them into a single framework, whose basic assumption is that the pattern of capital accumulation & SE change in Third World countries is shaped by world-system, SC, & state factors jointly, rather than independently of one another. Only by looking at interactions among these structural factors can concrete ways in which each of them influences the pattern of accumulation be illuminated. The role of the Third World state in linking the world system & SC forces to the development process is examined in detail. 1 Figure, 36 References. HA.

AB  - The research constitutes the first effort to test the claim found in the world city theoretical literature that, as world cities strengthen ties with each other, their linkages with their countries' hinterlands and national urban systems will weaken. This research offers a more nuanced exploration of this hypothesis by taking into account variation in the nature of the state across countries in which world cities are located as well as the source of global capital in the world cities. Specifically, the research reported here suggests that three types of world cities-market-centred bourgeois world cities (MWC), state-centred political bureaucratic world cities (SWC) and dual-role world cities (DWC)-entail different deterritorialisation outcomes. Three countries that have prototypical global cities-Japan (SWC), China (DWC) and the US (MWC) are compared, applying longitudinal network modelling to relational data on national city networks. From 1993 to 2007, more globally connected MWCs weakened their national ties. In contrast, higher global status has no significant effect on the integration of SWCs or DWCs with their national urban systems. This indicates that the type of state, but not the source of capital, conditions whether the world city will deterritorialise vis-A-vis its national city system.

AB  - We report the results of a historical investigation and quantification of discontinuous evolution, and a gap statistic analysis of discontinuities, on city size distributions of the city system in Texas, USA, over a 160-year period from 1850 to 2010. The growth of the city system exhibits four stages that are evident from our quantitative analysis of the convergence of population in large cities and qualitative analysis of historical socioeconomic and technological developments. The decadal city size distributions in the aggregate evolve with a persistent pattern while individual cities over time shift positions in the urban hierarchy as the result of adapting or passing growth opportunities in infrastructure innovations, economic change, and industrial transformations. These decadal city size distributions exhibit persistent discontinuities that mainly occur in the upper and lower tails. The observed patterns and discontinuities are indicative of the stability and resilience of a complex adaptive system of cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Te Urban Profiling is a rapid and action-oriented BACKGROUND urban assessment of needs and capacity-building gaps at national and local levels. It is currently being implemented in over 20 countries in Africa and the Arab states. Te urban profiling uses a structured approach where priority interventions are agreed upon through a consultative process. It consists of three phases: (1) a rapid participatory urban profiling at national and local levels, focusing on governance, informal settlements, gender and HIV/AIDS, and environment, and proposing interventions; (2) detailed priority proposals; and (3) project implementation. Urban Profiling in Zambia encompasses profiles of Lusaka, Kitwe, and Livingstone, each published as a separate report. Tis is the Livingstone report and it constitutes a general background, a synthesis of the four themes – governance, informal settlements, gender and HIV/AIDS, and environment – and priority project proposals. Livingstone, the capital of Northern Rhodesia before independence and before Lusaka became the capital, is the largest town in Zambia’s Southern Province. Te city is the tourist capital of Zambia and has the potential to be the number one tourist destination in southern Africa. Among the tourist attractions, Livingstone city boasts Victoria Falls, the seventh wonder of the world. Te Livingstone District area is 672 km², with an estimated population of 114, 000 inhabitants. Livingstone is the main administrative centre for the southern region of Zambia and it is the main entry point into the country by road from southern African countries such as Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa. However, Livingstone as a district has a number of development gaps: unequal distribution of infrastructure development, inadequate provision of social services, high poverty levels, degradation of the environment and natural resources, unemployment, and,

AB  - Critical urban theory is a reflexive project with practical intent that engages our present situation in order to map humane paths to the future. At the heart of critical urban theory is the critique of the actually existing city and the unmasking of the ways in which its topography has been the result of different economic, political, social and cultural processes that are neither ad hoc nor inevitable. As a deconstructive/constructive project, critical urban theory can be considered as the tracing of a utopian map aiming at the city to come. Critical urban theory should be considered as the invocation of the city that is to come—the dwelling of the properly realized humanity. This city to come is configured as the topos where humans may fashion their humanity in accordance with their freedom—the contours of such a city are traced by the proclamation of the right to the city, which is to be understand as the right to have rights.

Some of the ground that the Report covers falls outside the World Bank’s traditional development mandate, a refl ection of a growing international policy consensus that addressing violent confl ict and promoting economic development both require a deeper understanding of the close relationship between politics, security, and development. In study- ing this area, the World Bank does not aspire to go beyond its core mandate as set out in its Articles of Agreement, but rather to improve the effectiveness of development interventions in places threatened or affected by large-scale violence.

AB  - Liberty City is a virtual city, created for use with several versions of Grand Theft Auto (GTA), a best-selling series of video games concerning the world of crime. Millions of people all over the world have spent large amounts of time exploring this virtual space, making the city an important cultural artefact and a meaningful landmark in the urban imaginary on a global scale. The aim of this paper is to analyse Liberty City in terms of the imagined urban political geographies nested in the aesthetics of this space in the video game GTA IV. In order to develop this analysis, a theorization of urban politics will be presented, where politics is identified as consisting of representation, government and contestation. The paper will introduce methodological notes concerning the analysis, carried out mainly on the basis of a personal exploration of Liberty City. The paper then outlines the neoliberal political unconscious embedded in the urban dimension of Liberty City and proposes final theoretical reflections on the possible relations between the urban, the political and the aesthetics of video game practices.

AB  - Caloundra City Council recently selected an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) to meet their document and records management needs. Early on in the project, the Council recognised that the success of the EDMS would largely be determined by the usability of the classification scheme (or file structure) they implemented. The Council knew that deploying a classifi- cation with a high level of usability would enable staff to efficiently and effectively re- trieve as well as file documents. On the other hand, if the classification did not match the way staff think about their jobs and the doc- uments they produce, the result would be inconsistent filing of documents and a high level of frustration when staff try to search for them. In short, the effectiveness of the EDMS as a business and information man- agement tool would be in jeopardy. At the time of the EDMS implementation, we were assisting Caloundra City Council with their intranet, this lead to us being asked to coach the project team in evaluating the us- ability of the EDMS classification. The Council had selected Keyword for Councils as a starting point, as it was developed spe- cifically for local government and is used by Queensland State Archives as the basis for the appraisal of records.

AB  - It is a paradox of American life that we are a highly urbanized nation filled with people deeply ambivalent about urban life. An aversion to urban density and all that it contributes to urban life, and a perception that the city was the place where "big government" first took root in America fostered what historian Steven Conn terms the "anti-urban impulse." In response, anti-urbanists called for the decentralization of the city, and rejected the role of government in American life in favor of a return to the pioneer virtues of independence and self-sufficiency. In this provocative and sweeping book, Conn explores the anti-urban impulse across the 20th century, examining how the ideas born of it have shaped both the places in which Americans live and work, and the anti-government politics so strong today. Beginning in the booming industrial cities of the Progressive era at the turn of the 20th century, where debate surrounding these questions first arose, Conn examines the progression of anti-urban movements. : He describes the decentralist movement of the 1930s, the attempt to revive the American small town in the mid-century, the anti-urban basis of urban renewal in the 1950s and '60s, and the Nixon administration's program of building new towns as a response to the urban crisis, illustrating how, by the middle of the 20th century, anti-urbanism was at the center of the politics of the New Right. Concluding with an exploration of the New Urbanist experiments at the turn of the 21st century, Conn demonstrates the full breadth of the anti-urban impulse, from its inception to the present day. Engagingly written, thoroughly researched, and forcefully argued, Americans Against the City is important reading for anyone who cares not just about the history of our cities, but about their future as well.

AB  - This paper questions the 'peculiar epistemological framework of problems' (p. 107) through which the city has come to be considered in the academic and policy arena, in politics of both the Left and Right, and in urban sociology, planning, architecture and other areas of urban study. Baeten argues that contemporary terminology, for example, displays a negativity towards the city, a fear of the unknown city, by turns explicit (in a discourse which favours a lexicon of 'exclusion', 'deprivation' and 'polarization') and implicit (an 'urban renaissance' presumably emerges from an urban Dark Age). In these current projections of dystopia the author identifies parallels with 19th-century obsessions and frameworks of urban morality - the categorization of an underclass, and positioning of the city's poor as 'deserving' or 'underserving'. Baeten uses recent work on Orientalist constructions of the Other in a bid to contest such negative presentation of the city in current urban studies. There are interesting links here with Gil Doron's work in this issue of City.

AB  - In the past generation, there has been a slow revolution in economic thought, brought about by the recognition of imperfectly competitive markets, due mainly to increasing returns to scale, spillovers, and circular causation. A new way of thinking has transformed the classical analysis of industrial organization, economic growth, and international trade, and has delivered what were at fi rst controversial, but now widely accepted, implications for the progress of developing countries. Part two of the Report illustrates the interplay between scale economies, factor mobility, and transport costs to explain the formidable forces that shape the spatial transformation described in part one. Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are the stops in a tour of the “engine room,” each spotlighting a diff erent facet of the interactions among agglomeration, migration, and specialization.

AB  - A new poll of 15 nations, most of them in the developing world, finds that majorities of the people canvassed want their governments to take steps to fight climate change, even if that entails costs. People signaled they would support public measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions and step up adaptation measures. For example, respondents would support higher fuel efficiency standards for cars, preserving or expanding forests, and extending funding to vulnerable countries so they can develop hardier crops suited to more severe climates.<p>The poll was commissioned by the World Bank?s World Development Report 2010 on Climate Change and Development. The poll is the first to specifically target developing countries and ask a comprehensive set of questions regarding climate policy. Its aim is to provide the public in developing countries with an avenue to make their voices heard in a debate often dominated by developed countries? views, and give decision makers a tool to assess the state of public views on climate change in their countries. Polling was conducted among 13,518 respondents in 15 nations?Bangladesh, China, Egypt, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, Senegal, Turkey, the United States, and Vietnam.

AB  - Architecture and urban planning define much of the world we interact with. This has a wide variety of deep and not always immediately obvious effectseverything from the kinds of things we can do in public spaces to the kinds of families we can live with. While the transparency and responsiveness to actual community need varies, even the best architecture is usually conservative. The cities we end up with rarely allow us the kind of flexibility and humanity we want. Cities, buildings, infrastructure: all of these things are systems. They are heavily politicized with embod- ied power structures on a number of different levelsstructural, functional, aesthetic, economic, political, and social. At each level, we can intervene, alter those power structures, and create the spaces we need and want. Architecture is generally the domain of the rich and powerful, but it does not have to bewe can intervene and hack the city. In this paper,we will explore the power structures of the modern city at the level of architecture and urban planning. Then, we will look at a variety of different techniquesprototypes for ways we as individuals can subvert the city. We will move outside the design-culture consumer conversation around architecture and urban futurism, and explore how to actually change our cities, one brick at a time.

AB  - Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, became internationally known as the modern city par excellence. However, recent discussions on architecture, urban studies, city planning and globalization seem to have forgotten this city, dislocating it from its visible place. This essay discusses some critical approaches that could help us to locate Brasilia on the map again. The first approach is defined here as national, as it deals with the internal historical development and present situation of this city in the face of external challenges. The second relies on the European debates on modernity and postmodernity, highlighting the role of Brasilia within aesthetic and philosophical critiques of modernism. The third inserts the city within the field of tension between colonialism and postcolonialism in Latin America. After considering these approaches, the conclusion indicates the need to reassess Brasilia according to a wider international perspective, which the author defines as global inter‐location.

AB  - This paper aims to analyze the contesting process in building Taipei as the world city in Taiwanâ€™s current democratic transition period. Special attention is paid to the dwindling status of Taipei as the world city due to the North-South political divide in the national politics in which the ruling party supports its politically based city in the south as contesting with Taipei in the north where the opposition party has been dominant. We argue that this North-South divide provides a favorable environment for the ruling party to mobilize and maintain its support in the south as against the north which has nevertheless resulted in the declining status of Taipei in the international city competition.

AB  -  A system platform for location-based entertainment applications of mobile phones is described. With GPS and electronic compasses, some of today's mobile phones have rich functions for such entertainment as role playing games, treasure hunting, sightseeing with virtual information, etc. Our system model can manage virtual worlds that can be overlaid onto the real world with regard to location (latitude and longitude). Each virtual world is a set of virtual architectural objects and virtual creatures. Virtual creatures are active objects that can interact with users. In this paper, browser-based and BREW-based systems for virtual worlds are described. BREW is an efficient software platform for mobile phones. It enables autonomous location sensing and automatic redrawing, which will solve most of the problems found in evaluation sessions of the browser-based version.

AB  - While there has been progress towards pandemic preparedness in recent years, continued vigilance and investments are critical for global health security, people’s livelihoods and economic development. There have been three major epidemiological events in the first decade of this century: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. They demonstrate that we face continuing threats of pandemic influenza and other infectious diseases. The risk would appear to be increasing. Pandemics of both known and – as yet – unknown infectious diseases threaten people and economies of all countries. Developing countries are likely to be the hardest hit. There have been intense efforts to address H5N1 HPAI since the early outbreaks of disease in poultry in 2003. They have resulted in significant reductions in the number of countries affected since 2006. This trend could easily be reversed if focus is not maintained and resources are not allocated as part of the routine business of ministries of health and agriculture. There are three priorities. First – continued joint working by governments, communities and industry, both for multi-hazard disaster preparedness and for bio-secure animal rearing. Joint efforts are needed to prevent and control H5N1 HPAI, to ensure that control and response systems tackle a broad range of emerging and existing disease threats and to improve coordination between animal, human and environmental health disciplines. This One Health approach is necessary to ensure that countries are ready to detect, assess and respond to pandemics. Second – long-term investments in animal and human health. Experience from the global responses to SARS, H5N1 HPAI, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 provide lessons for the future, moving away from emergency measures to longer term sustained disease prevention, the development of capacities to respond to incursions and, where appropriate, to eradicate disease. There will always be a need for improvement in the forecasting and monitoring of disease emergence, spread and potential impact. This will aid the management of risks and consequences, and lead to better capacity for tackling problems at source before they become regional, continental or global threats. The One Health approach will greatly facilitate development of these capacities. Third – well-functioning animal and human health delivery systems. Effective responses to animal and pandemic influenza are best implemented locally. Therefore, all countries should aim to have strong, practical and predictable delivery systems for animal and human health, including emergency and contingency planning systems that reflect global standards and legal frameworks such as the OIE veterinary standards and the WHO International Health Regulations. World leaders at the International Ministerial Conference on Animal and Pandemic Influenza (IMCAPI) 2010 indicated their political support for these priorities through The ‘Hanoi Declaration’ and backing for the ‘Framework for Sustaining Momentum’ – two documents that feature prominently within this report.

Gephart explores why law continues to hold a low status in sociological discourse of the modern & attempts to construct a sociological theory of law using George H. Mead's explanation of the social as an interactive identity & a theory of the lifeworld built on Alfred Schutz. Habermas applies discourse theory to law. He incorporates theories of communicative & strategic action & emphasizes law as institution & medium. Habermas is particularly concerned with issues of legitimacy. Luhmann conducts a radical reduction of law to an autopoietic system, arguing that law is a late product of social evolution. He avoids questions of social control by contending that law defines itself. 3 References. E. Blackwell

AB  - In this article, Frank Webster sets out to "swim against the current" of some recent thinking on cities. In particular, he takes to task what he calls the "new urbanism" in which cities are seen as the new drivers and switching centres of an emerging economy which is largely deindustrialized, global and places a high premium on knowledge and information professionals. Webster goes on to test these ideas against Birmingham, the UK's second largest city, which has been keen to reap the assumed benefits of this new urban paradigm. Attempts to reinvent Birmingham are discussed such as the revamped historical canal system, the corporate leisure hub of Brindley place and through the city's internal cultural and ethnic diversity. However, Webster is less sanguine about attempts to transform Birmingham into a knowledge city because large swathes of the city's population play little or no role in the emerging new economy. He ends by questioning why there is such an air of inevitability about the new urbanism and why the "dull compulsion" of economics continues to exercise its dominant influence. In particular, he highlights the ways in which the vision from metropolitan elites of a brave new exonomy sidelines the experiences of many urban dwellers, especially the elderly for whom the new urbanism means little apart from a loss of community.\nIn this article, Frank Webster sets out to "swim against the current" of some recent thinking on cities.

Since 1900 the geographical distribution of these cities has become increasingly dispersed; their city-size distribution by rank was nearly linear in 1900 and 1940, and convex in 1980. We interpret the convex distribution which emerged following World War 2 as reflecting an economically integrated but politically and demographically partitioned global urban system.  Our interpretation of changes in size distribution of cities emphasizes demographic considerations, largely neglected in previous investigations, including migration and relative rates of population change."

Currently, most cities fell into a troubled state with the urban problems, such as traffic, parking, garbage-treatment etc. However, most cities in the world still concentrated on the building of the elementary stage of city informatization. The intelligent city system was centering on knowledge, with advanced information platform and intelligent social service by all latest technology means. In detail, Intelligent City realizes the information collection and management, dynamic inspection and decision-making etc. The paper constructed its concrete building frame, which was composed of Intelligent Basis Level, Intelligent Application Level and Intelligent Decision Support Level. There were also some sub-systems in each level and they interacted with each other. All these levels and sub-systems formed a bigger comprehensive scheme, which had the abilities of self-study, self-balance and self-regulation.

A detailed set of long-term outcomes and outputs were identified in the Joburg 2040 Strategy to realise the City’s long term vision. The City’s five year IDP translates these long term outcomes into implementable programmes for a specific term of office. Business planning is the short term planning tool that deals with annual operational planning.

AB  - Urban planning and development is a field which unconsciously recognises the role of non- human actors in transforming the market environment – a process which often starts with exploring the constraints of sites or the cost implications of altered development forms. This paper explores some of those non-human actors central to planning and development at a fringe development site in Sydney, Australia. This paper draws upon actor-network theory to position non-human actors as vital to the construction and maintenance of any networked reality, not least residential development. In this reading non-humans represent central actors and intermediaries which circulate through planning and development networks. An actor-network theory framework provides an in-depth analysis of residential development and planning policy which facilitates the identification and tracing of actors/intermediaries which may otherwise be neglected, ignored or forgotten. Special attention is paid to the multiple ways in which non-human actors interact to facilitate the development of residential property and associated policy arrangements – focusing on endangered species and topography.

AB  - The geography of urban deprivation is both real and âimaginedâ. The combination leads to biased and often quite polarized views of cities, their dynamics and their future. Unfortunately the tendency is to depict poverty and deprivation as ugly, as an âimproperâ part of urban life which should be eradicated and replaced by âproperâ middle-class physical constructions and social structures. But research which avoids the âimaginingâ shows that this is an unacceptable view of the the inner city where in fact people, despite their poverty, set up a wide array of social, cultural and economic networks of real meaning, which enable them to enter the labour market, to develop mutual support and to participate in cultural activities of all kinds, just like anybody else.

Countering some alarmist voices in the West, neither migration nor Muslim culture are to be blamed for the contemporary crisis, but the very nature of unequal capitalist accumulation and dependency that is at the core of the world capitalist system. For one, our analysis is based on current thinking on Kondratiev waves of world political development inherent in recent work by IIASA and the NATO Institute for Advanced Studies. First we present a rigorous re-analysis of United States Department of State data on acts of global terrorism in the framework of Kondratiev cycle waves. The data presented show that before the present war in Iraq the global war on terrorism already showed very positive effects, and that the strong linear downward trend in global terrorism, to be observed during the last two decades, coincided with rising globalization in both the centers and the peripheries of the world system, and that the percentage of people with less than 2 $ a day even declined in the Middle East and North Africa. We also found no systematic interaction between the differentials of growth in the center and the periphery or inequality differentials in the center and the periphery and patterns of global terrorism. I. e. a western socio-liberal, multi-lateral and non-interventionist policy could have won the fight against international terrorism. We then refute empirically the Huntington hypothesis about the incompatibility of Islam and successful socio-economic development.
