AB  - This text is a study of the representation of the city in the modern novel that takes difference as its point of departure, so that cities are read according to the cultural and social position of the urbanite. These urban narratives are analyzed in the context of a cultural repertoire of city codes, from the architectural features of window and streets to the social and historical signs of the landmark and the passerby, with the emphasis on the subjects construction of his or her place as shaped by history, politics, nationality, gender, class, and race. The study moves from boundaries inscribed onto the cityscape to distances experienced by the city dwellers; its real and textual cities are Warsaw, Jerusalem, New York, Chicago, Paris, London, and Dublin. The novels discussed are by Isaac Bashevis Singer, Amos Oz, Theodore Dreiser, Ralph Ellison, Henry James, Henry Roth, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. 目次: ・4PART 1. INTRODUCTION - READING CITIES: 1.

AB  - Representative driving cycles across the Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan region illustrate a direct relationship to urban land use. Movement away from the central business district results in fewer traffic events, higher speeds longer cruise periods and shorter stops. The consequent reduction in root mean square acceleration leads to a corresponding reduction in vehicle emission factors. Urban planning implications are persued and highlight the importance of public transport as an option in reducing urban air pollution.

AB  - Urban open spaces such as parks, open squares, parkways, etc, are considered as amenity resources or local public goods and incorporated into neoclassical urban land-use theory. Models characterizing Pareto efficient allocations and competitive equilibrium allocations with open space are presented. The 'fiscal profitability principle' suggested by Margolis is confirmed to be applicable to determine an efficient distribution of open space. Many interesting results are established. For example, if utility function is Cobb~Douglas or log-linear, then rich will locate farther away from poor, irrespective of the distribution of open space; the optimal density distribution of open space is uniform if the spillover effects of open space are neglected, and it is decreasing with the distance from the CBD when the spillover effects of open space are taken into account.

AB  - Many academic and practicing planners continue to examine local organizational effects on urban form despite failure to substantively theorize organizational functioning. This neglect, interestingly enough, occurs in spite of the recent emergence of innovative theories on organizationalfunctioning put forth by fellow planners and social scientists. This article informs planners of the need to theorize more penetratingly about organizations and reveals an evolving literature on this topic. It introduces frameworks such as urban managerialism, revisionist managerialism, organizational structuralism, and structuration, by tracing their evolution, substance, and points of controversy. The results suggest that planners need to theorize more substantively about the interconnections among societal structures, organizational morphology, and individuals. These influences generate active but bounded decision-makers who structure frequently unorthodox actions.

AB  - This study investigated whether preferences and biodiversity are compatible in an urban green space setting and whether people actually recognise and appreciate ecologically rich environments when exposed to these as part of a recreational visit. Data were collected through an on-site visitor-employed photography (VEP) study employing both lay people and ecology experts. Photos were taken by the participants during a walk along a 1.6. km trail through a recreational park with clear habitat variation. Half of the lay people and half of the experts each took five photos of features reflecting high preference and five reflecting low preference. The remaining half each took five photos of features they perceived to represent high species richness and five representing low species richness. Photos and written comments were then compared against an assessment of biodiversity values of the different habitats experienced along the trail. The results indicated that people can correctly perceive differences in biodiversity between urban green space habitat types. High biodiversity did not, however, relate positively to preference as half-open park areas were preferred to areas of more complex vegetation. Nevertheless, negative preferences for these richer habitat types were mostly related to the presence or execution of human interventions. The VEP method revealed on-site perception and preference to be highly context-specific, mainly triggered by specific features rather than the overall scenery and character of the setting. Differences in attitude between experts and lay people suggested that ecological knowledge could have a positive influence on preference for certain aspects of biodiversity. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spatial structure of urban green space system has an important effect in the following aspects: configuring urban resources, controlling urban size, improving ecological quality of urban and disaster prevention and mitigation, etc. Based on the summarization of advanced spatial layout pattern, the author puts forward the compound layout pattern of &#x0022;ring-network-wedge-radiation type&#x0022; of Changsha. From two levels (planning area and city center area) and five aspects (green-ring, green-corridor, green-network, green-center and green-wedge), the paper explores the construction theory of spatial structure of urban green space system, and constructively proposes the planning ideas and methods of green-corridor width, green-center scale and green-wedge scale. These conclusions can provide scientific guidance for the planning of spatial structure of urban green space system in Changsha.

AB  - While Jay W. Forrester's book Urban Dynamics has received considerable attention since its publication in mid-1969, very little has been done to apply the computer model which that book describes to an actual city. This thesis summarizes the beginnings of what may become the first large-scale effort to refine and apply the Urban Dynamics model to help meet the problems of a real urban setting. A three-month preliminary study in the city of Lowell, Massachusetts has developed strong official support for an expanded effort to develop an Urban Dynamics-type modeling process which can become an ongoing element of the city's long run policy and decision-making system. The city of Lowell—its history and its current socio-economic structure —contains strong parallels to Forrester's general theory of urban behavior. Lowell has experienced a life-cycle which clearly reflects a period of exponential-type growth followed by a peak near 1920, and a subsequent decay to a less healthy condition. Many of the factors which have apparently influenced Lowell's current troubles are also suggested in Urban Dynamics. Parameter modifications, made on the basis of current Census and other data, have generated model behavior which resembles the city in nearly all important general respects. Resulting in a good approximation of the city's past and, more important, a high degree of accuracy in describing the city's present employment, housing, and population characteristics, these modifications have increased our confidence in the model's potential utility. The model's general framework provides an understanding of Lowell's urban system which points to some potential errors in present city policy, and some directions for change. To improve the quality of analysis, to allow precision in problem definition and resolution, will require substantially more work. This thesis is intended as a sunLnary of the origins and a focus for the future of a promising new method of diagnosing and treating our most severe urban ills. Thesis Supervisor: Jay W.

AB  - Using a satellite image processing and econometric model, the paper aims to contribute to urban surface structure efforts of addressing the question of how urban thermal environment management should be carried out. The objective is to reveal quantitatively the effect of the spatial variation of city's structure on nearsurface air temperature, which related to canopy layer heat island. The whole system mainly consists of three connected systems: automatic digital terrain surface model generation from ALOS PRISM satellite images, which has the ability to provide precise and reliable urban spatial structure parameters, and modeling the relation between urban surface structure and the near-surface air temperature variation within urban area. The model is developed based on temperature data collecting at 27 sites in Sendai, Japan. All related arguments for model specification and evaluation have been done thoroughly in this research. The results indicated that parameters related to urban spatial structure are important for governing temperature variations in urban area.

After an overview of current CC adaptation approaches, it describes the two asset adaptation framework components; first, an asset vulnerability analytical framework that appraises the vulnerability groups most affected by CC-related disasters, and second, an asset adaptation operational framework that identifies CC strategies at individual, household and community level in four phases of long-term resilience; pre-disaster damage limitation; immediate post-disaster response; and rebuilding. It concludes by describing its associated methodology. The paper aims to assist CC researchers and those supporting the poor protect and rebuild assets during CC-related disaster processes.

AB  - A theoretical model of the urban land market is solved to examine the impact of bimodal passenger transportation on equilibrium residential land use. In this model travel to the central business district occurs on a dense system of radial roads or bus routes and a competing system or radial expressways or mass transit lines fed by a subsidiary system of densely spread access streets. Under rational behavior assumptions for households, it is shown that various basic urban forms can result depending on the relative generalized cost characteristics of the competing dense and sparse radial networks. The basic urban forms yield fundamental shapes, differing as to the relative geometry and position of the market areas for the two modes. The standard Alonso-Muth model of unimodal travel and circular urban form is found to result as a special case in several of these cases. American llrbanized areas of various sizes and modal mix provide plausible examples for each of the basics forms. The paper concludes with a discussion of the model’s implicat,ions as a framework for examining optimum urban transport structure and the proliferation of transport routes as a fun&on of urban size.

Using canonical correlation analysis, the main features of the relationships are identified and a measure of the redundancy between the two sets of variables is provided. The unsolved aggregation problem is also discussed. All results indicate a significant though rather weak linkage between migration and urban structure. Comparison of results at the inter-sector and intercommune scales points to the existence of stronger relationships at the larger, inter-commune scale. © 1982 the Annals of Regional Science.

AB  - Four hundred years of developing, shifting and changing marks the city of Dhaka with a strong culture heritage. Traditional hierarchies and organic spatial structures form a rich mix of indigenous morphology, which is obvious in historically famous and organically developed bazaar streets and commercial interfaces. The urban development of Dhaka city is well known for its spatial structure. A 'space syntax' technique is used to understand the structure, function, underlying logic, morphological growth and evolution of the urban systems. This article focuses on both the spatial dynamics of the urban structure and on the spatial nature of the bazaar streets (commercial networks) and aims to explicate the notion of the configurational analysis of urban growth. By determining the syntactic pattern and evolution of the bazaar streets, this analysis can be usefully applied to designing for future urban growth.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) have attracted attention around the world because they profoundly affect biological diversity and human life. Assessing the effects of the spatial structure of land use on UHIs is essential to better understanding and improving the ecological consequences of urbanization. This paper presents the radius fractal dimension to quantify the spatial variation of different land use types around the hot centers. By integrating remote sensing images from the newly launched HJ-1B satellite system, vegetation indexes, landscape metrics and fractal dimension, the effects of land use patterns on the urban thermal environment in Wuhan were comprehensively explored. The vegetation indexes and landscape metrics of the HJ-1B and other remote sensing satellites were compared and analyzed to validate the performance of the HJ-1B. The results have showed that land surface temperature (LST) is negatively related to only positive normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) but to Fv across the entire range of values, which indicates that fractional vegetation (Fv) is an appropriate predictor of LST more than NDVI in forest areas. Furthermore, the mean LST is highly correlated with four class-based metrics and three landscape-based metrics, which suggests that the landscape composition and the spatial configuration both influence UHIs. All of them demonstrate that the HJ-1B satellite has a comparable capacity for UHI studies as other commonly used remote sensing satellites. The results of the fractal analysis show that the density of built-up areas sharply decreases from the hot centers to the edges of these areas, while the densities of water, forest and cropland increase. These relationships reveal that water, like forest and cropland, has a significant effect in mitigating UHIs in Wuhan due to its large spatial extent and homogeneous spatial distribution. These findings not only confirm the applicability and effectiveness of the HJ-1B satellite system for studying UHIs but also reveal the impacts of the spatial structure of land use on UHIs, which is helpful for improving the planning and management of the urban environment.

AB  - The author finds that the character of self-similarity is very clear in Hangzhou when he studies the evolution of urban morphology and structure of urban land use using the theory of fractals. By dint of the box counting method, several maps of urban land use of different years are utilized to extract the basic data, and then the fractal dimensions of urban morphology and seven kinds of land are calculated. It is not difficult to find that most of the standard error σ are less than the criterion δc = 0.04, which was put forward by Benguigui et al. The author finds that the status of fractals of urban morphology and land use structure tend to be better with the elapse of time, which testify the viewpoint of foreign scholars about the evolving city fractals. Another important findings of the paper is that the fractal dimension of every land use is less than that of the total urban morphology, which is only a theoretical deduction before. From the viewpoint of spatial-temporal change, the fractal dimension of Hangzhou's urban morphology tends to be increasing, and in 1996 it is near D = 1.71, a mean value of fractal dimension summarized by Batty et al. As far as different urban land use of Hangzhou is concerned, the fractal dimensions of residential, industrial and external traffic land tended to be increasing from 1980 to 1996, while the fractal dimensions of education and virescence land tended to be decreasing during the same period.

AB  - Cities play an important role in population distribution and economic development. Policies which alter city systems can create new patterns of spatial economic development. This paper, using the most recent data, examines changes in China's city hierarchy, urban policy and spatial development in the 1980s in international, national and local contexts. The time series data show that the process of urbanisation had been gradual between 1949 and the late 1970s but accelerated rapidly in the 1980s. The growth of cities and towns in various size categories reflects the influence of urban policy in reshaping China's urban hierarchy. Using multiple measures of urban primacy, the analysis suggests that China has distinctive city systems at the regional level varying along demographic, industrial and infrastructural dimensions. Moreover, there is a growing discrepancy in socioeconomic development between inland and coastal cities that is consistent with the recent policy of favouring the coastal economy. The study provides perspectives and evidence on the extent to which economic efficiency and spatial equality are balanced under a changing model of socialist urban development.

Therefore climate measurement stations are permanently set-up on different land uses, and additionally mobile climate measurements are carried out every year at the same time and similar climate conditions. The study area is Santiago de Chile, one of the most dynamic and fast growing cities in South America. Urban Structure Types (UST) are delineated for areas under investigation in which the urban morphology is rather characteristic for the social strata. UST are compared with climate parameters to find out if significant correlations exist between UST and climate measurements.

AB  - City Rules offers a challenge to students and professionals in urban planning, design, and policy to change the rules of city-building, using regulations to reinvigorate, rather than stifle, our communities. Emily Talen demonstrates that regulations are a primary detriment to the creation of a desirable urban form. While many contemporary codes encourage sprawl and even urban blight, that hasn't always been the case-and it shouldn't be in the future. Talen provides a visually rich history, showing how certain eras used rules to produce beautiful, walkable, and sustainable communities, while others created just the opposite. She makes complex regulations understandable, demystifying city rules like zoning and illustrating how written codes translate into real-world consequences. Most importantly, Talen proposes changes to these rules that will actually enhance communities' freedom to develop unique spaces.

AB  - The nature and form of the urban environment is a critical determinant of the sustainability of our society, as it is responsible directly for a large proportion of consumed energy, and influences indirectly the patterns and modes of energy consumed in everyday activities. We examine the current state of research into the energy and greenhouse gas emissions attributable directly or indirectly to urban form. Specifically, we look at the embodied (construction) and operational energy attributable to the construction, maintenance and use of residential dwellings, and we review the literature on the relationship between urban structure and private travel behaviour. While there is clear evidence from both intra- and inter-city comparisons that higher density, transit-oriented cities have lower per-capita transport energy use, the effect of housing density on residential (in-house) energy use is less clear.

A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - More than 70% of the European population live in urban areas, and the level of urbanisation is steadily increasing. As a result urban and peri-urban woodlands are decreasing due to infill development within cities and sprawl (or expansion) outside cities, respectively. However, comparative assessments of urban woodland resources at international and national levels are lacking. We used GIS analyses to quantify the proportion of urban woodlands in 100 Swedish cities with >10 000 inhabitants. Field surveys were used to measure vegetation structure in 474 urban woodlands across an urban gradient in a subset of 34 cities. Our results showed that the proportion of the city area comprised of urban woodland varied between 1 and 40% with an average of 20%. Commuter cities close to the largest cities and cities with stable populations had higher proportion of urban woodland than cities with large population increase. Urban and peri-urban woodlands cover an area larger than the total area of protected forests in Sweden and had higher amounts of dead wood than typical non-protected forests. Thus, these woodlands are potential areas supporting conservation of species depending on dead wood. Commuter cities are expected to have a large population increase in the upcoming years, which may lead to further fragmentation of urban woodlands in these cities. Management greatly affected the vegetation structure in woodlands across the urban gradient, and decision makers and urban planners need to be informed about the ecological consequences of different management actions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease globally and is usually associated with built environments in tropical areas. Remotely sensed information can facilitate the study of urban mosquito-borne diseases by providing multiple temporal and spatial resolutions appropriate to investigate urban structure and ecological characteristics associated with infectious disease. In this study, coarse, medium and fine resolution satellite imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and QuickBird respectively) and ground-based data were analyzed for the Greater Puntarenas area, Costa Rica for the years 2002-04. The results showed that the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generally higher in the localities with lower incidence of dengue fever during 2002, although the correlation was statistically significant only in the dry season (r=-0.40; p=0.03). Dengue incidence was inversely correlated to built area and directly correlated with tree cover (r=0.75, p=0.01). Overall, the significant correlations between dengue incidence and urban structural variables (tree cover and building density) suggest that properties of urban structure may be associated with dengue incidence in tropical urban settings.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate if the forest remnants of the city and the system of green space corridors could support target species for conservation, in the form of red-listed forest bird species, to show through the presence of the target species what habitat qualities are still possible near cities, and to reveal those features and properties of the landscape structure that were important in this sense. The findings could be used for developing guidelines for design of urban green space corridors. A spatial analysis was performed, covering the landscape in the study area and 67 sample sites with natural vegetation, within and outside of the green space corridors. Breeding forest birds were recorded and breeding of target species in the sample sites as functions of landscape descriptors was tested using logistic regression. Seven red-listed forest bird species were found breeding in the sample sites. Considering them as indicators of habitat qualities, the results would imply that the qualities of the urban and suburban forests were due to a vast range of deciduous forest, especially broad-leaved, and possibly also to a lower intensity of forestry than in rural areas, resulting in a sufficient number of mature and decaying trees. The logistic regression models showed that important properties of remnants of natural vegetation were large areas of forest on rich soils, together with connectivity in the form of amounts of this habitat in the landscape. These properties were associated with the green space corridors. Implications for the design of urban green space corridors would be to treat mature and decaying trees and patches of moist deciduous forest as a resource for vulnerable species, and to conserve large areas of natural vegetation together with a network of important habitats in the whole landscape, in this case forest on rich soils, also in built-up areas.

AB  - Increased urbanization typically leads to an increase in abundance of a few species and a reduction in bird species richness. Understanding the structure of biotic communities in urban areas will allow us to propose management techniques and to decrease conflicts between wild species and human beings. The objective of this study was to describe the structure of the bird community in an urban ecosystem. The study was carried out in the city of Taubat, in southeastern Brazil. Point-counts were established in areas with different levels of tree density ranging from urban green spaces to predominantly built-up areas. We looked for a correlation between the richness/abundance of birds and the size of the area surveyed, the number of houses, the number of tree species and the number of individual trees. The results of multiple regression showed that bird richness had a direct relationship with vegetation complexity. The abundance and diversity of tree species were better predictors of bird species than the number of houses and size of the area surveyed. We discuss implications of this study for conservation and management of bird diversity in urban areas, such as the need to increase green areas containing a large diversity of native plant species

AB  - Despite being conspicuous and influential features of the biosphere, urban ecosystems have been neglected in ecological research. Arthropods are abundant in urban settings, but little is known about how these animals respond to urbanization. We systematically monitored the structure of ground arthropod communities for 12 months at 16 sites representing the four most abundant forms of urban land use (residential, industrial, agricultural, and desert remnant) in a rapidly growing metropolitan area (Phoenix, AZ). Although taxonomic richness was comparable among land-use types, community composition differed, with certain taxa being uniquely associated with each form of land use. Three taxa (springtails, ants, and mites) were extremely widespread and abundant, accounting for over 92% of captures; when these three taxa were excluded from analysis, however, differences were revealed in arthropod community composition with urban land use. Trophic dynamics also varied with land use: predators, herbivores, and detritivores were most abundant in agricultural sites, while onmivores were equally abundant in all forms of land use. These community-level differences resulted from taxon-specific responses to habitat structure, which varied with land use. Because arthropod community structure is affected by habitat structure and land use, and because arthropods play key roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollination, and soil aeration, the spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems therefore may affect ecosystem functioning. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Based on geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques, the landscape classes of urban land use in Shanghai City were extracted from SPOT images with 5 m spatial resolution in 2002, and then, the classified data were applied to quantitatively explore the change patterns of several basic landscape metrics at different scales. The results indicated that landscape metrics were sensitive to grain- and extent variance. Urban landscape pattern was spatially dependent. In other words, different landscape metrics showed different responses to scale. The resolution of 40 m was an intrinsic observing scale for urban landscape in Shanghai City since landscape metrics showed random characteristics while the grain was less than 40 m. The extent of 24 km was a symbol scale in a series of extents, which was consistent with the boundary between urban built-up area and suburban area in Shanghai City. As a result, the extent of 12 km away from urban center would be an intrinsic handle scale for urban landscape in Shanghai City. However, due to the complexity of urban structure and asymmetry of urban spatial expansion, the intrinsic handle scale was not regular extent, and the square with size of 24 km was just an approximate intrinsic extent for Shanghai City.

AB  - In China, rapid urbanization has profoundly transformed the spatial pattern of urban land use, including urban green spaces. The government plans to optimize green spaces to integrate with urban development; this requires an understanding of the process of green space change. Quantification of green space patterns is a prerequisite to understanding green space changes, and is essential for monitoring and assessing green space functions. This paper presents a new method for quantifying and capturing changes in green space patterns, through a case study of Jinan City, China, during 1989-2004. Supported by GIS and remote sensing, the method comprises quantification of local area green spaces by the "moving window" technique (using FRAGSTATS), and a gradient analysis involving sampling from the urban center to the fringe. Results demonstrate that the significantly altered green space pattern could be quantified using landscape metrics in each local area. Gradient analysis undertaken in eight directions from the urban center reflects the changes in and effects of urbanization, and the implementation of government policy. In comparison with quantifying metrics in entire landscapes, this method more effectively links patterns and processes, and can establish an important basis for subsequent analysis of ecological and socioeconomic functions of green spaces.

AB  - Population growth and redistribution generate urban development in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties throughout the USA. This paper presents an analysis of population growth and urban development within a non-metropolitan county in southeastern New York State. Land use data for a 30 km by 50 km study area were integrated with ancillary physiographic data in a raster geographic information system. Spatial analysis of these data revealed that urban land uses increased from 6.7% of the landscape in 1968 to 17.8% in 1985, resulting in an expansion in urban land area that was eight times faster than the increase in population. The number of urban patches, or contiguous urban areas, decreased from 936 to 829, although the average size of the urban patches increased from 9.4 to 25.4 ha. The majority of the new urban land was residential development located between 3 and 25 km from the central business districts of the villages and cities within the landscape. Spatially dispersed urban development generates incremental landscape changes that typically contribute to environmental degradation. Land use policies designed to protect environmental quality in urbanizing landscapes should focus, therefore, on accomplishing at least three objectives: (1) minimize further fragmentation of the ecological infrastructure; (2) restore, where practical, severed linkages in the ecological infrastructure; and (3) guide new development to locations near existing urban centers. If any of these objectives are to be met in the adversarial legal and political milieu of the USA, policy makers must devise land use controls that do not constitute a 'taking' of private property. This paper argues that effective rural land use controls will not be widely implemented, or successfully withstand legal challenges, until empirical research demonstrates that land use spatial patterns directly affect both environmental quality and human quality of life, and that unregulated land markets in urbanizing landscapes encourage land use changes that inevitably degrade environmental quality.

AB  - In highly developed landscapes, the soil heat flux that results from changes in land cover determines, in part, the extent to which urban climatic conditions can be modulated (e.g. retrofitting cities with new, engineered green spaces to reduce urban heat island effect). In this paper, temperature-dependent (TD) and temperature-independent (TI) soil heat flux models are validated against 6 days of measurements made in an engineered urban green space. The results suggest that the TI model (heat flux plate method) represents the observations better than the temperature-dependent one, which consistently overestimates soil heat flux at night and during the dusk-dawn period. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis reveals that the TD model is more sensitive to the selection of thermal conductivity and heat capacity values than the TI model. It can be concluded that the TI model is a more robust predictive tool, and especially in urban applications where soil properties may be highly uncertain. ?? 2012.

AB  - Economic theory of urban growth controls by Engle et al. (Journal of Urban Economics, 1992, 32, 269-283) is extended to the direction of endogenous residents' utility in a closed two-city economy. It is shown that the growth control policy is justified strictly only in the case in which there exist some size-related externalities in the process of urban growth. It is also shown that if the growth control policy is needed anyway, it is necessary to have an intervening policy concerning the population allocation among cities even before growth.

AB  - Ur spatial structure & class relationships within Ur environments of dependent capitalist social formations contrast strongly with those evidenced in advanced capitalist industrialized nations. A theoretical understanding is proposed of capital accumulation that characterizes core & periphery in the world system. The concepts of "articulated" & "disarticulated" accumulation are used to analyze these alternative processes & to link class formation & class struggle to their objective expressions in the structure of Ur space. The analysis of Ur structure in peripheral social formations must begin with a theory of dependency. The issues over which classes struggle & their capacities to engage in struggle are determined by the constraints on the process of accumulation at a world system level & their differential focus in the international DofL. These processes are themselves mediated by the state & the forms of state intervention. The structurally distinct process of "disarticulated" accumulation in the periphery is used as the basis for a consideration of Ur structure within dependent capitalist nations.

AB  - The provision of services related to green-space maintenance, such as grass cutting, tree pruning, litter collection, or weed control, is an integrated part of urban green-space management. Since contracting out has become common practice in urban green-space management, it is now a key challenge to develop well-functioning frameworks for managing the provision of outsourced green-space maintenance. With the public sector reform of the New Public Management, an emphasis on the four tenets of specification, pricing, monitoring, and enforcement of service provisions is now pervasive in the 'standard framework' for contract design and management. Based on an action research intervention, this paper puts forward an 'extended' framework for the design and management of green-space maintenance contracts that can help managers of urban green space to devise contract designs and management practices better adapted for green-space maintenance. The action research intervention took place as a part of efforts by the Danish Palaces and Properties Agency to improve green-space maintenance contracting in historic parks and gardens by implementing a performance management scheme. In addition to assessing the merits of the performance management scheme, the paper focuses on a new set of tenets related to the role of coordination, communication, motivation, and restraint of power. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - According to the regulations and policies in Hubei Province, the potential of the ecological land in Wuhan City was analyzed with GIS, based on the land use map and the basic farmland protection map of 2006 in scale 1:10 000. The results showed that the area of ecological land could be 51 028.75 similar to 113 537.77 hm super(2). If all these ecological land were used for forestry, the greening ratio of the city could increase 6.01% similar to 13.37%. If only the banks of streams and rivers, the roadside and the slope farmland were all converted into the forest land, the forest coverage would increase by 1.91% similar to 9.27%. And when only those unused land were made good use, this percentage would be 4.1% more than present. So it is concluded that the unused land should first be planted with trees, and it is also necessary to appropriately add the amount of the conversion from the other land to the forest land.

AB  - The world has seen a significant rise in the number of conflicts and an intensification of their impacts, over the last few decades. UN-HABITAT has responded swiftly and effectively to these situations, whether in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia or Sudan. One of the key areas of UN-HABITAT intervention and assistance has been institutional development and capac- ity-building in post-conflict situations, where conflict is often characterized by a breakdown of governance institutions and anarchy in human settlements reconstruction and redevelopment. UN-HABITAT has played a key role in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, in restoring urban gov- ernance practices and introducing new local development planning process. UN-HABITAT has been engaged with the central and local governments in the Western Balkans through several interventions, most of them focusing on strengthening processes of participa- tory governance. The Urban Planning and Management Programme (UPMF) in Kosovo was a path-breaking intervention where UN-HABITAT worked closely with both central and local institutions to support the development of new policy and legislation relating to urban and spatial planning; to enhance local capacity for good governance and inclusive planning; and to strengthen local institutions with support from experts and professionals from across the world. UPMF is still being applied at the time of publication to train municipal and urban plan- ners in inclusive, strategic and action-oriented planning practices. Globally planning is in a state of flux and is reinventing itself to incorporate many of the charac- teristics mentioned above. Traditionally, urban planning has been seen as a means to control and regulate the development of towns and cities. In the cities of the developing world as well as in the post-conflict and post-disaster context, however, these traditional planning approach- es have failed to address the challenges of rapid urbanization and the poverty, exclusion, informality and vulnerability which it brings in its wake. At the third session of the World Urban Forum held in Vancouver 2006, discussions on a renewed role for planning in ensuring sus- tainable urbanization generated enormous interest. Several events brought to the fore several innovative cases and examples of how things are changing. UPMF is another example. It was also highlighted, however, that there is still a lot to be done, in order to change the practice of planning across the world, especially in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

AB  - The aims of this paper are to empirically test and evaluate methods for describing intraurban polycentricity, and to evaluate the polycentric development with respect to the regional development plan of the Office of Urban and Regional Transportation in 2001. The study area is Stockholm County and the time period investigated is 1991-2004. Three dimensions of polycentricity are analyzed: urban nuclei size relations, spatial distribution of urban nuclei, and potential interaction (accessibility). According to the methods' various qualifications in describing polycentric forms it is proposed here that a combination of methods is preferable for this subject. The polycentric structure exposes an increasing and considerable concentration of urban resources to the major urban nuclei. This concentration is combined with an increased spatial dispersal of the urban nuclei. In relative terms, the accessibility has decreased concerning the accessibility by public transportation modes and increased (workspace) or remained on almost the same level (residential space) by car transportation mode. Thus, the urban structural change in the Stockholm region corresponds to the political guidelines. In spite of this, by the increase in relative accessibility by car and decrease in the relative accessibility by public transportation modes the goal concerning higher share in public transports may not be possible to fulfill.

AB  - Cities are shaped by numerous decisions, yet urban spatial structure and locational decision-making are seldom linked. A principal components typology of land use change isolates four major processes of change: suburbanization, core area renewal, infrastructure growth, and specialized nucleations. These components identify the key decisions and decision agents involved. Comparative analyses of land use change and of site selection by individual developers in Toronto suggest a three-level hierarchy of locational determinants relating to the choice of site, to both site and context, and to factors apparent only at an aggregate level.

AB  - Conventional thinking in urban remote sensing is to synchronize the dates of when satellite imagery is captured with the date a social survey, such as a population census, is collected. It's assumed that identical dates, or dates as similar as possible, are intuitively important in order to make sure that structure, the physical configuration of a city as captured by remote sensing, relates as closely as possible to function, the socio-economic characteristics of a city, as represented by population censuses. However, this type of intuitive thinking is surely flawed because the structure of a city is hardly ever in harmony with the functionality of a city, at the same time. It is much more realistic to assume that there is a temporal lag between the socio-economic demands from a city's population and the consequential physical ramifications of such demands. In other words, the tangible layout of a city, i.e. roads, houses, etc, is a result of prior decisions made by planners with respect to demands from the city's population. This paper explores this temporal lag between structure and function by comparing the physical structure of cities from satellite images at T+1 with the functionality of the socio-economic characteristics from a population census in T-1. Initial results suggest an improved ldquoagreementrdquo between satellite images taken after a population census, in terms of predicting population growth and predicting residential demands. Further testing is needed in order to establish a theoretical link that can be used by planners in deciding where to develop cities, how sustainable such increased development can be contained and how best to reduce overcrowding, congestion and overall social deprivation.

AB  - Most studies of the economic activity of ethnic and immigrant groups have been conducted with little regard to their spatial conditions and consequences. At the same time, geo- graphic concentration or clustering of residences and businesses is often cited as a significant element in the formation of ethnic economies. This paper argues that spatial location may operate as a defined resource in enhancing the prospects of ethnic businesses. Specifically, it examines how the geographical concentration of residences or the clustering of businesses may operate to incubate beginning businesses, foster linkages between businesses, increase the opportunities for the establishment of additional businesses, and serve as an economic and cultural focus for the ethnic community. The paper then speculates on how the spatial patterns generated by ethnic eco- nomic activity will vary depending on the type of resources utilized, the sectoral composition of the ethnic economy, and the maturity of the economy.

AB  - Despite the unprecedented rate of urbanization around the world, information regarding land use planning and management is not updated frequently enough to accurately track this urban change. In order to monitor changes in the urban environment, an understanding of the change in patterns of urban development over time is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study is to explore an approach for combining remote sensing and spatial metrics to monitor urbanization, and investigate the relationship between urbanization and urban land use plans. The study areas, consisting of the cities of Hanoi, Hartford, Nagoya and Shanghai, were examined using Landsat and ASTER data from 1975 to 2003. In this study a program based on the PLADJ spatial metric was undertaken to produce urban growth maps. Then, FRAGSTATS was used to evaluate the characteristics of urban composition. The results showed that the urban core of Nagoya changed moderately over time. Shanghai had a high population density, and satellite towns absorbed potential suburban development. Hartford exhibited a spread out pattern of urban development with a high concentration of settlement in the suburb. Conversely, the new urban areas of Hanoi developed rapidly along major transportation routes, resulting in urban development in Hanoi assuming an unusual pattern. The combined approach of remote sensing and spatial metrics provides local city planners with valuable information that can be used to better understand the impacts of urban planning policies in urban areas, particularly in Hanoi. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cities are the “engines of growth” because entrepreneurial and cre- ative activities are concentrated in cities. This suggests that cities grow by host- ing new businesses and “churning” industries advantageously. In so doing, cities need to adapt their spatial structure to mitigate negative externalities. Our previous paper (Lee and Gordon 2007) found that the links between urban structure and growth vary across metro size: more clustering in small metros and more dispersion in large metros were associated with faster employment growth. In this paper, we extend our research to investigate to what extent ur- ban spatial structure variables – dispersion and polycentricity – influence net new business formation (NNBF) and industrial “churning” in a cross-section of 79 U.S. metropolitan areas in the 2000s. The results of least squares regression and locally weighted regression analyses are mixed. OLS results for recent years fail to replicate our results for the 1990s. But applying a more powerful LOESS approach does give results for spatial impacts on NNBF and industrial churning that are consistent with the links between spatial structure and urban growth found in the earlier paper.

AB  - Last few decades witness a dramatic increase in city population worldwide\nassociated with excessive urbanization rates. This raises the necessity\nto understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable\ndistribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial\nintelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and\ntransition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban\ngrowth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature\nusing simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work\nis to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify\ntransition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that\nis designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and\npopulation density. Transition rules in our model identify the required\nneighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration\nis performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic\nalgorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters,\nincluding objective function, initial population, selection, crossover\nand mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic\nalgorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential\nimplementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values\nusing a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations.\nMinimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors,\nis used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated\nin term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration\nwith genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal\nrule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed\ncalibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban\ngrowth of Indianapolis-IN, USA. Urban growth results show a close\nmatch for both urban count and pattern with reality.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Increasing the use of urban green space has appeared on the political agenda, primarily because increased use is expected to improve the health and well-being of the urban population. Green space is contributing to restoring mental fatigue, serving as a resource for physical activity, reducing mortality and reducing the level of stress. However, knowledge and experience on how to implement this agenda are scarce. In this paper, we use a socio-ecological model as framework when studying influences on the use of respondents’ nearest urban green space in the Danish city of Odense. Data were obtained from a survey sent to 2500 randomly selected adult residents within the central part of the city. We tested the relative importance of different factors on the frequency of use of the nearest urban green space by using a multivariate logistic regression model. The results show that almost half of the respondents did not use their nearest green space the most. Whether or not respondent used their nearest green space most depends primarily on area size, distance to the area and factors that are likely to express a reduced mobility; old age, young children and poor health. If the nearest urban green space also is the most used green space, having a dog is the only factor that significantly increases the frequency of use. Further research is needed to determine what it is that makes people use an area more, if the basic conditions of a reasonable size (>5ha) within a reasonable distance (<600m) are fulfilled.

AB  - Urban spaces have changed in function and essence as a result of the technologies which have been introduced in the last decade. Most notably wireless communications infrastructure has enabled many technologies that have impacted citizens relationship with the city. For example, real time information systems and mobile connectivity have influenced how people live and work and consequently inhabit the city. These behavioral shifts mark a new relationship among citizens, technologies and urban spaces. This general examination will explore these links and establish a framework, which describes both technological and physical, spatial parameters. The main area will focus on the impact of networked, digital urban infrastructures on public spaces. The literature will review both historical shifts such as electrification as well as recent introductions of wireless and networked urban systems. The emphasis will be on display technologies and responsive or interactive technologies and their relationship to urban form. The technical area will review technologies and technological frameworks for responsive urban environments. The literature will review responsive technologies and sensor networks for ubiquitous computing and ambient information systems. The contextual area will draw on readings from the field of urban sociology to give a theoretical background for the types of interactions and experiences a new group of urban technologies could facilitate. I will focus on the relationship between social interactions and the visual form of the city. The readings will draw mainly on dramaturgical and performative ways of reading public spaces and some literature in spatial cognition.

AB  - Urban areas have developed under anthropogenic impact and hence feature strongly altered environmental conditions that influence today’s plant species distribu- tion. Generally, urban areas are rich in plant species, but on smaller scales richness can vary considerably. Our study aim is to identify areas of high species richness and to assess richness distribution patterns in the city of Hamburg by analyzing a floristic mapping dataset on the scale of 1 km2. Differences in plant species richness were analyzed between three urbanization zones. With multiple regression analyses, we tested effects of urban structure, habitat, and environmental conditions on the distri- bution of species richness measures. Total species richness per 1 km2 was 274±60 on average and differed only slightly between the urbanization zones. It increased with habitat diversity and decreased with Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for nutrients (multiple R2=0.31). Proportion of non-native species increased with mean annual temperature and decreased with EIVs for moisture (multiple R2=0.72), while propor- tion of endangered species increased with EIVs for moisture and decreased with EIVs for nutrients (multiple R2=0.66). Proportion of thermophilic species (multiple R2=0.58) could be explained bymean annual temperature. The emerging patterns probably differ from those in other cities due to the central port harboring a particular flora. Besides the expected high proportions of non-native species, high proportions of endangered species were also found in this area. Our results contribute to identifying drivers of biodiversity in cities and can thus be used to develop measures for the conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most evident global changes. Research in the field of urban growth modelling has generated models that explore for drivers and components of the urban growth dynamics. Cellular automata (CA) modeling is one of the recent advances, and a number of CA-based models of urban growth have produced satisfactory simulations of spatial urban expansion over time. Most application and test of CA-based models of urban growth which provide likely and reliable simulations has been developed in urban regions of developed nations; urban regions in the United States, in particular. This is because most of the models were developed in universities and research centers of developed nations, and these regions have the required data, which is extensive. Most of the population growth in the world, however, occurs in the developing world. While some European countries show signs of stabilization of their population, in less developed countries, such as India, population still grows exponentially. And this growth is normally uncoordinated, which results in serious environmental and social problems in urban areas. Therefore, the use of existing dynamic-spatial models of urban growth in regions of developing nations could be a means to assist planners and decision makers of these regions to understand and simulate the process of urban growth and test the results of different development strategies. The pattern of growth of urban regions of developing nations, however, seems to be different of the pattern of developed countries. The former use to be more dense and centralized, normally expanding outwards from consolidated urban areas; while the second is normally more fragmented and sparse. The present paper aims to investigate to how extent existing CA-based urban growth models tested in developed nations can also be applied to a developing country urban area. The urban growth model was applied to Porto Alegre City, Brazil. An expected contiguous expansion from existing urban areas has been obtained as following the historical trends of growth of the region.

AB  - Urban environmental stewardship activities are on the rise in cities throughout the Northeast. Groups participating in stewardship activities range in age, size, and geography and represent an increasingly complex and dynamic arrangement of civil society, government and business sectors. To better understand the structure, function and network of these community-based urban land managers, an assessment was conducted in 2004 by the research subcommittee of the Urban Ecology Collaborative. The goal of the assessment was to better understand the role of stewardship organizations engaged in urban ecology initiatives in selected major cities in the Northeastern U.S.: Boston, New Haven, New York City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. A total of 135 active organizations participated in this assessment. Findings include the discovery of a dynamic social network operating within cities, and a reserve of social capital and expertise that could be better utilized. Although often not the primary land owner, stewardship groups take an increasingly significant responsibility for a wide range of land use types including street and riparian corridors, vacant lots, public parks and gardens, green roofs, etc. Responsibilities include the delivery of public programs as well as daily maintenance and fundraising support. While most of the environmental stewardship organizations operate on staffs of zero or fewer than ten, with small cohorts of community volunteers, there is a significant difference in the total amount of program funding. Nearly all respondents agree that committed resources are scarce and insufficient with stewards relying upon and potentially competing for individual donations, local foundations, and municipal support. This makes it a challenge for the groups to grow beyond their current capacity and to develop long-term programs critical to resource management and education. It also fragments groups, making it difficult for planners and property owners to work in partnership with them. The organizational networks are self-contained and do not include business or even legal groups, which may point to a gap between stewardship and environmental justice organizations.

AB  - This paper uses empirical evidence from the Balkan peninsula during the 1981-2001 period, in order to study the dynamic patterns of a conflict-affected city-size distribution. By examining the time variations of the Pareto exponent on the one hand and by exploring cities' relative growth patterns and intradistribution mobility on the other, the paper shows that city growth dynamics follow a 'hybrid' pattern, where city size filters the effects of external shocks. City-size dynamics thus seem more complex than that predicted by random growth or endogenous growth theories. In the Balkan peninsula, during the 1981-2001 period, medium-sized city demographics have resisted external shocks due to conflicts, redrawing of national frontiers and institutional upheaval better than large conglomerations. However, this does not lead to convergence towards a steady city size.

AB  - Urban growth boundaries (UGBs) are common tools employed by planners to constrain urban expansion in order to increase density of urban services and protect surrounding rural landscapes. Planners could use models that estimate future urban growth boundaries based on those factors that drive urban expansion. Unfortunately, few models have been developed that simulate the urban growth boundary. This paper presents an urban growth boundary model (UGBM) which utilizes artificial neural networks (ANN), geospatial information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to simulate the complex geometry of the urban boundary of Tehran, Iran. Raster-based predictive variables are used as inputs to the ANNs parameterized using vector routines. ANNs were used to train on seven predictor variables of urban boundary geometry for Tehran: roads, green spaces, slope, aspect, elevation, service stations, and built-area. We show that our UGBM can predict urban growth boundaries with urban area with 80-84% accuracy. The model predicts urban boundaries in all cardinal directions equally well. We use the model to predict urban growth to the year 2012. We summarize the use of UGBs in planning around the world and describe how this model can be used to assist planners in developing future urban growth boundaries given the need to understand those factors that contribute toward urban expansion. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in understanding urban interactions. We use a ?big? data set for Singapore from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation.In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders. Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements. The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into different areas that separate the population?s activity space into smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3 years of data, we find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and communities are emerging largely in line with the city?s master plan.To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements.

AB  - The "political economy of place" has emerged as an important theme in urban research in recent years. Within this theme, scholars have highlighted the role of so-called urban growth coalitions in the creation of conditions favorable for urban economic development. Among their activities, growth coalitions may be interested in jurisdictional organization and, in particular, municipal annexation. This paper examines the conditions that have facilitated annexation as a postwar growth policy in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio, and the role of urban growth coalitions in shaping the policy. The policy has been effective to the extent that annexation to Columbus for municipal purposes has not included decisions on the transfer of school district territory.

AB  - This paper uses Guangzhou’s experience of hosting the 2010 Asian Games to illustrate Guangzhou’s engagement with scalar politics. This includes concurrent processes of intra- regional restructuring to position Guangzhou as a central city in south China and a ‘negotiated scale-jump’ to connect with the world under conditions negotiated in part with the overarching strong central state, testing the limit of Guangzhou’s geopolitical expansion. Guangzhou’s attempts were aided further by using the Asian Games as a vehicle for addressing condensed urban spatial restructuring to enhance its own production/accumulation capacities, and for facilitating urban redevelopment projects to achieve a ‘global’ appearance and exploit the city’s real estate development potential. Guangzhou’s experience of hosting the Games provides important lessons for expanding our understanding of how regional cities may pursue their development goals under the strong central state and how event-led development contributes to this.

AB  - Assumptions about the role of neighbourhood effects are increasingly built into urban policies, particularly in relation to the role of spatial concentrations of disadvantage in perpetuating inequality and social exclusion. Nevertheless, hard evidence to underpin this assumption is still largely lacking. To help fill this gap, this paper focuses on the relationship between overall urban scale and the spatial scale of segregation, and on the implications of wider segregation for social outcomes at the individual level. Education is taken as a test case, because of the role of defined catchment areas in relation to school recruitment. Results show that: at given scales, larger city-regions are much more segregated; educational outcomes are only partly affected by neighbourhood effects for particular population characteristics; and greater individual inequality in more segregated areas is mainly due to positive impacts of segregation for more advantaged groups, rather than negative impacts for the most disadvantaged.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

AB  - A shift from monocentric cities to increasingly polycentric urban regions has been widely recognised in recent research literature. Although polycentricity in general refers to the existence of several adjacent centres within the same area, many studies have emphasised that functional linkages between the centres of an urban system are also an essential part of polycentricity. Despite the increasing number of studies concerning functional polycentricity, research on the subject is still in a development phase. In this paper, a new approach to measure functional polycentricity is presented, in which functional polycentricity is approached through the connectivity of individual centres to the whole urban system. The paper illustrates the potential of the method with empirical case studies addressing the urban spatial structures of three functional urban regions in Finland. In the case studies, detailed commuting data are used in order to measure the degree of functional polycentricity.

AB  - Climate risk arising from both climate variability and change is heterogeneous across a diverse range of spatial scales. At the global scale climate risk is generally assessed to be more acute in the coastal regions of developing and emerging countries which have significant exposure to climate hazards, but is additionally associated with the specific socio-economic context that exacerbates those hazards (Preston et al., 2006). At the national level, various sectors, ecosystems and regional subpopulations within these countries have been identified as being more or less vulnerable to changing future climatic conditions (IPCC, 2001). However, until today only few studies have attempted to explore the spatial heterogeneity of climate risk at smaller spatial scales, such as on the metropolitan or urban scale (Rosenzweig et al., 2000). As part of the research programme 'Sustainable Development of the Megacities of Tomorrow’ by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), a suite of projects is being funded in conjunction with other partners to assess climate change risks and possible adaptation and mitigation strategies at the scale of mega-urban regions. These projects are linked through an emphasis on the integration of knowledge about changes in the climate system together with knowledge over the regional context of urban growth centres in which those changes will occur. These projects are focused, on building energyand climate-efficient urban structures to mitigate climate risk and to enable adaptation strategies on the urban scale. The research project ‘Integrative Urban and Environmental Planning for Adaptation Ho Chi Minh City to Climate Change Sustainable Strategies for Climate-Oriented Urban Structures, Energy-Efficient Housing Typologies and Comprehensive Environmental Protection for Megacities of Tomorrow’ emphasises the impacts of climate change and the identification of adaptation strategies for ameliorating those risks, including constraints and barriers on decision making.

A theoretical analysis demonstrates how recent fiscal and governance reforms give rise to land conversion decisions and long run urban spatial sizes that respond to economic incentives even though the allocation of land between urban and rural uses is determined administratively. An econometric investigation of China's coastal provinces finds that changes in urban area are increasing in the value of urban land and budgetary government revenues and decreasing in the value of agricultural land, results consistent with the theoretical analysis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Urban traffic structure is the core issue of urban transportation industry. Reasonable urban traffic structure can meet urban residential transit demand, and also reduce greenhouse-gas emission of vehicles so as to decrease negative environment impact. Based on the principles of low-carbon economy, a quantitative model for environmental impact of urban traffic structure is established in this paper, which includes two sub-models. The first sub-model is urban traffic structure optimization model, which considers transport efficiency as target variable and various traffic factors as constraint variables. MOBILE software can be used to calculate carbon emission factors of different vehicles. The second sub-model is to calculate carbon emission gross of vehicles and analyze influence of different changing factors by using COMMUTER software. The quantitative model and corresponding analysis results will offer valuable suggestions for urban transport planning and environment protection.

AB  - Speculation on optimum city size has often resulted in conceptually elegant theoretical notions that have obscured the relationship between urban economic growth and development, and the resulting ecological effects. In addition, urbanites, upon realizing that development may preclude some aspects of their lifestyles, may become more interested in controlling growth. Before relationships between development and lifestyle may be operationalized, however, some means for predicting growth is necessary: input-output analysis is suggested here for that use. In addition, certain lifestyle expressions which present the relationships between growth in the sectors of the economy and land use, and air and water pollution are specified. For example, economic production may be limited by constraints in the natural sectors. In New Orleans, housing and industrial growth generally mean encroachment on wetland areas and therefore may be limited by the amount of wetland needed to support ecological systems. This can be expressed as a relationship between output in the sectors of the conomy and land used in production, where land use is constrained by available land. This and other similar constraints involving air and water pollution are formulated. Although optimum city size is not specified, the paper uses a linear programming formulation of the input-output model including lifestyle constraints to show how optimum city size might be specified. Ecological relationships are useful in predicting the impacts of development on the environment. However, they provide very few limiting conditions. It is up to the community to realize the sensitivity of its environment to development and to limit growth, even though such growth usually represents some trade off between existing or preferred lifestyles and development with its resulting lifestyles. Unfortunately, it is unusual for the community to realize the interdependencies between lifestyles, development, and size. It is the hope of this paper that, as sophisticated models such as input-output become operational at the local level, the links between development, size, and lifestyle will become more specified leading to better informed citizens and decision-makers, and improved decisions. Input-output as part of the framework presented here is a useful device to identify appropriate places and points in time, where intervention in developmental decisions by citizens is desirable.

AB  - A model of urban spatial structure for a linear and closed monocentric city is formulated by allowing the presence of randomly distributed idiosyncratic tastes for location in an otherwise uniform household population. Land use equilibrium conditions are shown to have a stochastic representation which depends on the distribution of the idiosyncratic tastes over the population of households. A special case in which the multinomial logit model gives the representative household's locational choice probability is derived and examined for a logarithmic utility function. It is shown that the stochastic equilibrium can also be obtained as the solution of a welfare optimum problem, either by maximizing total social welfare (primal) or by minimizing total opportunity cost (dual). Either formulation gives the equilibrium allocations and associated decentralizing land prices. Some comparative statics analysis is undertaken to show that while most results are like those of the Alonso-Mills-Muth model, increasing taste heterogeneity decentralizes the linear urban form, “flattening” the rent and population density gradients. The Alonso-Mills-Muth solution is obtained as an asymptotically limiting case which provides an upper bound on the “steepness” of the rent and population density gradients and a lower bound on the length of the linear city and the welfare level of the representative consumer.

It explores the correlation of the desire to be in close proximity to urban green space to engage in recreational activities (the need for recreation) related to residents' demographic and socio-economic factors: gender, education, monthly income and dwelling location. Residents' preferences for landscape elements and attributes of urban green space are examined using principal components analysis. In addition, regression analysis identifies that coherence and vegetation are the most relevant factors correlated with perceived overall recreational appropriateness of the three most frequently visited urban parks. The purpose of the study is to attempt to quantify people's recreation needs in urban green space; identify the landscape components in urban green space which can encourage more outdoor visits and/or greater recreational activities; and provide proposals and strategies on planning, management and conservation for recreation-oriented urban green space which will enhance people's enjoyment and wellbeing by improving landscape esthetic quality, recreational and ecological function. ?? 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This study analyses differences between counter-urban movers and movers heading for other destinations. Through the elaboration of a spatial model based upon settlement structure and functional hinterlands, counter-urban migration can be measured on the ground throughout the urban system. Empirical analysis of the counter-urban mover is rendered possible by access to a comprehensive longitudinal micro-database that contains demographic, socio-economic and detailed geographic information for all Swedish citizens. Binomial and multinomial logit models are estimated to capture the partial effects of variables related to the individual, the household, the labour market, life course events, and regional economic conditions on the choice of migration destination. The results of the analyses show that counter-urban movers are more likely to be older, born in Sweden or any other Scandinavian country, less well-off, having a university qualification, living single, being outside the labour force, and becoming unemployed close to the migration event. The emerging picture of the Swedish counter-urban mover reveals an individual who may be striving for other qualities in life, where career and earnings are of minor importance. Somewhat unexpectedly, the counter-urban movers show no systematic differences depending on their place of departure. No clear hierarchy-specific effects across the urban system can be found. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure. Improvements in ICT may lead to changes in urban structure, for example, because they reduce the costs of communicating ideas from a distance. Hence, they may weaken local agglomeration forces and thus provide incentives for economic activity to relocate to smaller urban centres. We use international data on city size distributions in different countries and on country-level characteristics to test the effect of ICT. We find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita encourage the spatial dispersion of population in that they lead to a more concentrated distribution of city sizes. So far the evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. We argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban structures once its use has spread more thoroughly through different economies.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Peri-urban areas are sites currently experiencing the most active urbanization. In order to quantify the complexity in urban growth patterns and processes, based on the common boundary and Landscape Expansion Index (LEI) analysis, we developed six spatial rules to identify three urban growth types of infilling, edge-expansion and outlying in 2000-2008. In addition, growth density (GD) with buffer zone analysis was applied to ascertain urban movement from the city center. Results indicated the prominent urban growth type was edge-expansion, with continued urbanization most prominently in the peri-urban areas. The infilling growth increment proportion in the second study period (2004-2008) suggested the study area was experiencing an increased coalescence pattern and declined diffusion pattern. However, the highest infilling GD zones that occurred primarily near the city center did not vary significantly in 2000-2008. The intensive urban growth zones in the first study period (2000-2004) followed by later efficient infill growth also suggested urban growth was more compact in the second study period. Furthermore, two land use change maps showed that substantial arable land was lost by urban growth in 2000-2008, and the establishment of industrial parks encroached on large salt marsh in the second study period. Further research is required to delineate a suitable development management plan to sustain a baseline for urban growth. Furthermore, the integration of a zoning approach associated with the green belt is suggested to play a key role in a transition to continued urbanization. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

After examining different types of housing development with reference to housing policy initiatives and their underlying processes at various levels, the paper identifies some contrasting features of urban spatial transformation. First, this transformation is characterised by the city-wide spread of socio-economic downgrading caused by private de-investment in the production sphere, in contrast to the pockets of socioeconomic upgrading resulting from private investment (on the urban fringe) and reinvestment (on the waterfront) in the consumption sphere. Secondly, the city has witnessed significant residential improvement (especially in the inner city) due to its success in securing public resource allocation, in contrast to economic devastation illustrating its increasing marginalisation in the movement of private investment.

AB  - Urban riparian habitats are potentially important resources for native birds in arid ecosystems. Most studies have assessed the value of urban riparian habitat in terms of vegetation and natural resources; however, the surrounding land use and infrastructure may determine the viability of urban habitat. We studied the impact of urban struc- ture, the combination of land use, infrastructure and vegetation variables that work together to shape the urban environment, on avian riparian habitat in the Truckee Meadows, Nevada, USA. Land use and infrastructure explained avian species richness and abundance better than local vegetation alone, but community resemblance was more strongly correlated to vegetation. Avian species guilds responded differentially to surrounding land use, suggesting there may be a functional difference between land use types. The best models for bird diversity used urban structure (both land use and vegetation) to describe potential habitat. Urban structure describes urban habitat in ways that vegetation variables alone cannot. Studies that ignore land use and infra- structure and other socioeconomic variables are likely missing key functional differ- ences within urban ecosystems, and may miss the potential for compatible development that encourages both biodiversity and urban growth.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding at a very fast rate worldwide. The task of managing urban growth has increased in both scope and complexity and has become one of the most important challenges in the 21st century. This article aims to examine the urban development and optimize spatial patterns of future urban growth allocation based on scenarios to provide a basis for urban environmental management in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. We developed an artificial neural network based urban growth allocation model for the valley. This predictive model optimizes spatial patterns of future urban growth allocation under the three scenarios, i.e., spontaneous, environment-protecting, and resources-saving. The predicted spatial patterns mirrors where and how the urban development in the valley is likely heading by 2050 and provides a crucial information on land availability for future land development projects. The results suggest that the current urban development process is in critical stage where urban and peri-urban areas will face unprecedented stress on land resources costing river and forest ecosystems and other environmentally sensitive areas by the next decade. Rural vicinities will face regional imbalance on urban growth allocations. However, there are still possibilities to improve urban environment and manage the potential land demands in the valley by enforcing the urban growth policies strictly and altering the current growth trend as revealed in the environment-protecting and resources-saving scenarios. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of an income tax in a monocentric city where households equilibriate their allocation of time between work, commuting, and leisure. An increase in the income tax rate lowers the implicit value of time, and hence transportation costs. "Compensated equilibrium" comparative statics analysis shows that under certain conditions, this results in a larger, more dispersed urban area, with lower land rents at the city center and less population within any given distance from the center. The welfare effect of an income tax rate change is also studied, and an expression for the marginal excess burden is derived. The income tax produces welfare losses both because it induces substitution in favor of leisure and in favor of travel-the latter accompanied by excessive spatial dispersion and consumption of space. The marginal excess burden depends not only on the compensated demand elasticity for leisure, but also on that for space. Finally, the problem of benefit measurement for transportation projects in this tax-distorted spatial economy is examined. Benefit measures should be deflated to adjust for the fact that further transportation improvements lead to reduction of land use intensity, exacerbating the problem of spatial resource misallocation in an already excessively dispersed urban area. © 1985.

AB  - Numerous authors have asserted that globalisation and occupational changes associated with post-Fordist economic restructuring have led to a growth in intraurban social disparity and even polarisation. This hypothesis is most consistently articulated in the literature on global cities. However, the social effects of post-Fordist economic restructuring and the interplay between occupational changes and social and spatial factors within urban areas are not well understood. This paper seeks to provide an initial investigation into processes of socioeconomic change which may be presently ocurring within cities, and to model how such processes may be articulated within urban space. To gauge the impact of occupational restructuring on the social structure of the city, and to test the assertion that economic changes are related to increased polarisation, shifts in occupation, immigration and income variables in the urban region of Toronto, Canada, are examined. The patterns of social and spatial change occurring between 1971 ands 1991 are plotted and the possible tendencies towards increasing polarisation are analysed and discussed.

AB  - For many years the need for good-quality, well-maintained urban parks, recreation grounds and other green spaces was not regarded as a priority and decline in many neighbourhoods set in. But green space makes a vital contribution to the quality of urban life and to the achievement of a range of Government objectives. Access to green space is a powerful weapon in the fight against obesity and ill-health, especially amongst children. Neglected parks seem to attract anti-social behaviour and have the potential to undermine regeneration of deprived neighbourhoods. In growth areas, good quality parks and open spaces are one of the best ways to ensure new communities blend harmoniously with old.

AB  - Population growth and redistribution generate urban development in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties throughout the USA. This paper presents an analysis of population growth and urban development within a non-metropolitan county in southeastern New York State. Land use data for a 30 km by 50 km study area were integrated with ancillary physiographic data in a raster geographic information system. Spatial analysis of these data revealed that urban land uses increased from 6.7% of the landscape in 1968 to 17.8% in 1985, resulting in an expansion in urban land area that was eight times faster than the increase in population. The number of urban patches, or contiguous urban areas, decreased from 936 to 829, although the average size of the urban patches increased from 9.4 to 25.4 ha. The majority of the new urban land was residential development located between 3 and 25 km from the central business districts of the villages and cities within the landscape. Spatially dispersed urban development generates incremental landscape changes that typically contribute to environmental degredation. Land use policies designed to protect environmental quality in urbanizing landscapes should focus, therefore, on accomplishing at least three objectives: (1) minimize further fragmentation of the ecological infrastructure; (2) restore, where practical, severed linkages in the ecological infrastructure; and (3) guide new development to locations near existing urban centers. If any of these objectives are to be met in the adversarial legal and political milieu of the USA, policy makers must devise land use controls that do not constitute a [`]taking' of private property. This paper argues that effective rural land use controls will not be widely implemented, or successfully withstand legal challenges, until empirical research demonstrates that land use spatial patterns directly affect both environmental quality and human quality of life, and that unregulated land markets in urbanizing landscapes encourage land use changes that inevitably degrade environmental quality.

AB  - For most resarchers in urban morphology urban form means the form of the urban fabric.  Most analyses are concerned above all with historical urban fabrics.  There has been insufficient exploration of modern urban tissue.  With its vast territorial expansion, the modern city has undergone radical changes. There has been a shift from the closed fabric in which the links between the different elements (plot, street, constructed space, and open space) formed a system, to an open fragmented peri-urban fabric. Autonomous, atomized elements do not relate to each other any more and their scale has changed greatly.  In these morphological transformations the infrastructure of transportation has played a dominant role.  New tools of analysis are needed to understand the new components of the modern urban fabric and their processes of formation.

AB  - The concept of 'automobile dependence', interpreted as a path-dependence phenomenon, informs this assessment of urban transport and structure trends in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area (KLMA). 'Automobile-dependent' cities, where high private vehicle use is strongly entrenched, are contrasted with 'traffic-saturated' cities, in which modest numbers of vehicles cause great problems for urban structures that are unsuited to them. Data from a recent international compilation are used to place the KLMA's patterns into perspective. The KLMA is found to be not yet very automobile dependent but a number of strong trends are encouraging and entrenching ever higher private motor vehicle use. Agencies in the KLMA are investing heavily in car-oriented mobility, while building urban designs that are hostile to non-car alternatives, yet with densities that may be incompatible with high car ownership and usage. These trends seem to run the risk of entrenching an intractable traffic crisis.

AB  - Three inventories were conducted to quantify Bangkok's green infrastructure for future planning and improvement in the context of a seasonal monsoonal dry climate. Total green space was quantified by extracting surface cover areas from remotely sensed data in a geographical information system (GIS) environment, and this information was used to designate suitable sites for future green spaces such as parks. Street trees were inventoried for species identification and size. Trees of heritage value were identified through a public awareness campaign, and then were subsequently surveyed for species identification, height and trunk diameter. GIS green space analysis showed that per capita park space was approximately 1.8 m2, but a master plan proposed increasing per capita park area to 4 m2 within 25 years. The increased park area will be largely in the form of lower cost, semi-naturalized tree parks. The inventoried street tree population, approximately 200,000, was skewed somewhat towards a monoculture, as 42% were the facultative evergreen Pterocarpus indicus Wild. By contrast, none of the other species exceeded 7% of the total. That most of the other species consisted of smaller trunk diameters than P. indicus, and therefore younger, suggests that Bangkok's street tree plantings are becoming more diverse. The heritage large tree inventory was dominated by evergreen tree species, particularly exceptionally large Ficus species, found largely on Buddhist temple grounds, followed by Albizia saman (Jacq.) Merr. The slower growing evergreen heritage species are worth careful appraisal and preservation because they are less likely to be commonly planted. Careful species selection balancing drought deciduous and dry evergreen species can achieve adaptation to the monsoonal dry season with diverse aesthetic quality in both Bangkok's street tree population and in its semi-naturalized tree parks. ?? 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This paper aims to demonstrate the relationship between economic growth and the urban core area in order to help urban planners reach a better understanding of the pressures that are leading to changes in land use. Using a unique panel dataset with measures of China's land use, it is shown that, during the late 1980s and 1990s, China's urban land area rose significantly. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis are then used to identify the determinants of urban land use change. In addition to using more standard regression approaches such as ordinary least squares, the analysis is augmented with spatial statistical analysis. The analysis demonstrates the overwhelming importance of economic growth in the determination of urban land use. Overall, it is found that urban land expands by 3 per cent when the economy, measured by gross domestic product, grows by 10 per cent. It is also shown that the expansion of the urban core is associated with changes in China's economic structure. If urban planners have access to forecasts of economic growth, using these results they should be able to have a better basis for planning the expansion of the built-up area in the urban core.

AB  - Rapid urbanization has caused many environmental impacts associated with the reduction of green space. Having realized the important role of green space in urban ecosystems, many local governments in China have set out a series of policies to introduce green elements into urban areas. Insights into how urban green space changes in response to urbanization and greening policies are essential for guiding sustainable urban development. This paper employed integrated approaches to characterize the changing patterns and intensities of green space in Kunming, China from 1992 to 2009. Spatial variations of green space pattern were derived through concentric and directional landscape analyses integrated with landscape metrics. Change intensities of the two time periods from 1992 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2009 were calculated for the study area as a whole, the concentric belts, and the directional transects to examine the variation of the green space change rate in the city. Results revealed that both rapid urbanization and greening policies accounted for the process of green space change. Among the green space land use types, agriculture land was largely encroached and fragmented by urban sprawl, especially in the outer belts of the city. Forest land was also impacted but encountered a relatively moderate loss rate compared to agriculture land. Conversely, greening policies contributed to the recovery of grass land in the last decade. The study demonstrated the usefulness of the concentric and directional landscape analyses in characterizing the spatial-temporal variations of urban green space in cities with a concentric development form. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial mismatch can here be the result of optimizing behavior on the part of the labor market participants. In particular, the unemployed can choose low amounts of search and long-term unemployment if they reside far away from jobs. They choose voluntary not to relocate close to jobs because the short-run gains (low land rent and large housing consumption) are big enough compared to the long-run gains of residing near jobs (higher probability of finding a job). ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In most metropolitan regions throughout the globe, urbanised land area is increasing to accommodate increasing population size. This article provides a simple yet powerful mathematical description of this urban expansion. Specifically, the following scaling relationship is proposed: land area (A) increases proportionally to population size (P) raised to a power (n)-- i.e. A {propto} P n. During 1950--2000, this relationship is found to hold well for US Census urban areas (UAs) with a greater than 10 per cent increase in population. Values for the parameter n vary among UAs, with a central tendency value of [~] 2, suggesting that, on average, newcomers to urban areas occupy about twice the land area per capita of existing residents. If n were exactly equal to 2, then the parameter group P/{surd}A (called `linear population density', or LPD) would be constant over time. LPD (units: people per metre) is the number of people in a metre-wide strip across an urban area. LPD is distinct from, and behaves somewhat differently than, population density. Distributions of LPD values among US UAs during 1950--2000 show surprisingly little variability over multidecade time-scales. For example, from 1950 to 2000, average population, land area and population density changed by more than a factor of 2, but average LPD changed less than 10 per cent. Few, if any, other attributes of urban form have remained so constant during this half-century time-period. International data corroborate the finding that LPD distributions are roughly constant over multidecadal time-scales. These results suggest an underlying pattern to how people arrange themselves within and among urban areas. For US UAs, rank--size rules similar to the generalised version of Zipf's rule hold for population, land area, LPD and population density. LPD is an important predictor of the emissions-to-inhalation relationship for motor vehicle emissions. Results presented here are important for theoretical, practical and empirical investigations of urban form and of how urban areas expand over time.

AB  - Recognition of the existence of nonlinear land prices has an impact on the measurement of the rate at which land price declines with distance from the urban center. It is hypothesized that concave parcel prices have given rise to overly large estimates of the rate of price decline with distance, because parcel sizes increase with distance and increased parcel sizes would be associated with lower unit prices as a result of the concavity of the land price function. This hypothesis is empirically tested using vacant residential, commercial, and industrial land sales from within Cook County, Illinois. An important finding is that allowing for concavity greatly reduces, although it does not eliminate, measured rates of price decline with distance.

AB  - With more than half of the world’s population living in urban areas and climate change, one of the biggest challenges of our times, it is time to turn our attention to cities in order to tackle this challenge. The layout or urban form of a city can influence the environmental impact of the urban settlement to a considerable extent. There are great differences between cities in terms of their urban form and their environmental footprints. Five key elements of urban form can be distin- guished: density, surface, land use, road/public transport infrastructure and the eco- nomic relationship with the surrounding environment. The compact city is often advocated as a more sustainable urban form but this is not undisputed. Urban form can influence the environmental impact, but it can only facilitate; it is people and their behaviour that ultimately determine the negative or positive environmental impact of urban areas.

AB  - The carbon dioxide balance for the Municipality of Florence (102.3km2), with 29.1km2 of green space within the built-up city and 46.6km2 in the semi-rural peri-urban area, shows that collectively the green spaces offset 6.2% of the direct carbon emissions. However the green spaces in the densely built-up city only offset 1.1% of the emissions. 13.5ktCO2y-1 are taken up by vegetation in the built-up areas and 58.7ktCO2y-1 by vegetation in the peri-urban area. Urban green spaces are most efficient in offsetting anthropogenic CO2 emissions during the period March to June when plant growth rates are high and emission rates are relatively low. Landscape fragmentation is highly positively correlated with total CO2 emissions and negatively correlated with CO2 uptake. The detailed information produced during this investigation shows that policies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in winter months will have a greater overall effect on total CO2 release to the atmosphere than those aimed at increasing CO2 uptake. Nevertheless, urban designers should consider all the benefits of urban green spaces and seek to ensure that new suburban development conserves green spaces and aims at sustainable urban design. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - International efforts to preserve the natural environment are mainly concerned with large, bio-diverse and relatively untouched ecosystems or with individual animal or vegetal species, either endangered or threatened with extinction. Much less attention is being paid to that type of nature close to where people live and work, to small-scale green areas in cities and to their benefits to people. Increasing empirical evidence, however, indicates that the presence of natural areas contributes to the quality of life in many ways. Besides many environmental and ecological services, urban nature provides important social and psychological benefits to human societies, which enrich human life with meanings and emotions. The main concern of this paper is to address the importance of urban nature for citizens’ well being and for the sustainability of the city they inhabit. Some results of a survey conducted among visitors of an urban park in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) are presented and discussed. The issues investigated concern people’s motives for urban nature, the emotional dimension involved in the experience of nature and its importance for people’s general well being. Results confirm that the experience of nature in urban environment is source of positive feelings and beneficial services, which fulfill important immaterial and non-consumptive human needs. Implications for the sustainability of the city will be analyzed and discussed.

Focusing on the Barcelona metropolitan region (BMR) between 1986 and 2001, we estimate a municipal employment growth model in which dynamic agglomeration economies related to urban spatial structure are considered using distance to employment centres, to assess metropolitan effects, and distance-weighted variables, to measure neighbourhood effects. The results obtained show the existence of neighbourhood specialization economies and metropolitan urbanization-localization economies fostering local growth. All of this leads to the paper’s main conclusion: urban spatial structure is important for economic growth in an intra-metropolitan context.

In the growth of urban structure these register the decisive practices of the social agents (factions of capital, the state, including all its levels, and labor) - whose actions create the city and define its identity. The above assertions are illustrated by an historical analysis of the social production of space in Mazatlan, a city that could have been just like any other in the industrialized world, but that today presents the characteristics of a Third World place as a result of the weak development of its productive forces, but especially of the way state intervention brought resources to the area only to have them exploited by elements of private capital, including foreign extractive sources. © SAGE Publications 2011.

Although a substantial literature has accumulated on this topic, relatively little attention has been given to the locational aspects of financial services. An attempt is made here to examine the spatial structure of this sector in terms of the urban system, drawing on the principles of central-place theory, the limitations and applicability of which are considered. This is followed by a discussion of the salient features of financial services within the overall urban system. After describing the differentiation of financial services in frequency terms, the hierarchical structure of the UK urban system is outlined. These two aspects are then related, in order to demonstrate the ordered nature of the spatial structure of financial services.

The results confirm previous research that concludes that only a small fraction of socioeconomic output can be considered to be a result of neighbourhood origin. Moreover, it is concluded that economic characteristics of neighbourhoods have a larger impact than ethnic ones. Growing up in a wealthy area adds to the risk of having a low income at 24 and 25 years of age, but growing up in a poor area adds to the risk of being unemployed.

AB  - After the historic review of the formation of the Hungarian capital this paper deals with the detailed description of the functional structure of Budapest. The historic core is delimited by the setting of the city on the Danube terraces. While the medieval part of Buda is preserved in the Castle District, the old Pest on the left bank totally disappeared and was rebuilt in the beginning of the century. It has office, business and residential functions. Both the Buda and the Pest sides have large outer residential belts both of villa and housing estate types, and belts of mixed functions. Finally the recent problems of the large housing developments sited on the outskirts of the town are introduced. Some of them are the neglect of the inner residential areas, the functions and centres in the large satellite housing estates, transportation problems.

AB  - Location-based assessments of accessibility gauge the attraction of a place relative to other places. These approaches have been used extensively in models of commuting and urban structure. Even though locational accessibility measures are integral to such efforts, they may also be used to explore aspects of urban spatial structure. As such, this paper presents a GIS-based analysis of locational accessibility for a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas. Indices of accessibility based on spatial interaction models are developed for intraurban residential and employment locations. Results show that residential accessibility patterns are similar across cities, taking a concentric pattern where the central urban area is most attractive. However, employment accessibility varies more from city to city; moreover, the areas of highest employment accessibility tend to be decentralized within their respective regions. Overall, location-based accessibility indices are useful for exploring urban form, particularly with respect to issues of urban sprawl. Directions for future research are identified, including linking comparative urban accessibility measures to ongoing work on commuting, the jobs-housing balance, and urban structure.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure. Improvements in ICT may lead to changes in urban structure, for example, because they reduce the costs of communicating ideas from a distance. Hence, they may weaken local agglomeration forces and thus provide incentives for economic activity to relocate to smaller urban centres. We use international data on city size distributions in different countries and on country-level characteristics to test the effect of ICT. We find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita encourage the spatial dispersion of population in that they lead to a more concentrated distribution of city sizes. So far the evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. We argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban structures once its use has spread more thoroughly through different economies.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Full article: UK, 18th March 2013 - As part of the response to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) the UK government has announced it will not commit to long-term financial support for the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) beyond 2013-14. This team plays a vital role in preventing wildlife crime here in the UK, and is also a contributor in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.  Commenting, Heather Sohl, species expert for WWF-UK said: "This is highly disappointing news, especially after the UK has fought hard towards an end to international wildlife trafficking at the CITES meeting over the last two weeks.[1] When the world is recognising illegal wildlife trade as a serious crime and looking for government commitments to end the trade, the UK should be stepping up its efforts to address these crimes within our own borders. The recommendations of the Committee are reasonable and would have achieved this, but the government is avoiding a long-term commitment to tackling wildlife crime."  The Government also rejected recommendations to tighten up the recording of wildlife crime data to help keep track and tackle trends in wildlife crime. Stephanie Pendry, Enforcement Programme Leader at TRAFFIC, who has worked as part of the unit, said: "I have witnessed first-hand the vital role that this unit plays. In the case of illegal wildlife trade, culprits are often part of wider criminal networks that operate across borders, and cracking down on such trade takes time and joint effort. It is precisely this time that the Unit have not been afforded by the Government, which is a real shame and will have a knock-on effect on operations to protect wildlife."  WWF and TRAFFIC gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) early last year and this was reflected in the October 2012 report on wildlife crime in the UK. It suggested that enforcement of wildlife crime in the UK is suffering due to the short term availability of funds, a lack of proper training and guidance over prosecutions, and unnecessarily complex legislation.[2]  UK prosecutors and judiciary must be aware of the serious nature of these crimes and how to handle them appropriately. Available penalties are not applied rigorously enough to reflect the nature of illegal wildlife trade crimes, so fail to act as a strong deterrent for future offences. Specialist wildlife crime training for generalist prosecutors and sentencing guidelines for the judiciary are needed.  The creation of specific wildlife crime codes have been rejected by the Home Office, but without the ability to record wildlife crime levels it is impossible to show the impact of such crime, and what trends are occurring, both over time and regionally. It is hard to justify more resources when it is not possible to demonstrate the true size and trends of the problem. If codes are not the answer, WWF and TRAFFIC urge the government to demonstrate an appropriate, alternative way to capture the information on crimes so desperately needed using existing systems.  Many of the EAC recommendations are also reflected in their inquiry from 2004. WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the Government to reconsider how it can take appropriate actions to address wildlife crime.  Notes to editors: [1] CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP) took place in Bangkok, Thailand between 3 and 14 March 2013. www.cites.org  [2] The Environmental Audit Committee conducted an inquiry into Wildlife Crime in the summer of 2012 and published its report in October. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/140/14 002.htm  [3] In February 2-13 the government announced one further year of funding for the unit until April 2014 - at the same level of funding as 2012-13 - but it did not comment on its intentions to make a long-term arrangement for funding the Unit, as recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee.

AB  - Kampala, the capital of Uganda, is one of the fastest growing African cities with annual growth rates of 5.6%. The rapid urban growth causes major socio-economic and environmental problems that lower the quality of life of the urban dwellers. A better insight in the controlling factors of the urban growth pattern is necessary to develop and implement a sustainable urban planning. The recent urban growth of Kampala was mapped using LANDSAT images of 1989, 1995, 2003 and 2010. A spatially-explicit logistic regression model was developed for Kampala. Significant predictors in this model included: the presence of roads, the accessibility of the city centre and the distance to existing built-up area. These variables are used as steering handles to create future urban scenarios. Three alternative scenarios for future urban growth were developed: a business as usual, restrictive and stimulative scenario. Our model of growth was applied to these three scenarios to predict patterns of urban growth to 2030. The scenarios show that the alternative policy options result in contrasting future urban sprawl patterns with a significant impact on the local quality of life. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Commentary around the electronic media has raised issues of political action, community formation and changing identities. This paper explores how the notions of `public space’ can inform this debate over electronic media. It examines the metaphorical adoption of urban models to look at electronic sociality and suggests four principle approaches: cities set in or against world ¯ ows, suburbanised telecities, communitarian visions and accounts that appeal to a renewed public sphere. The paper examines how these share many assumptions. However, instead of trying to sift these metaphors by contrasting them to a purported real world, the paper examines how they shape an electronic architecture. Spatial metaphors and electronic practices are seen as entangled and shaping each other. The paper suggests that the different metaphors for the city re¯ ect a range of anxieties about and desires for urban life. In this sense, the `real’ city is the inde® nable complexity and folding of spacesÐ lying outside the visualisations offered of cyberspace.

AB  - This paper proposes a varying coefficient model (VCM) to introduce city- and tract-specific variables into the exponential density functions used to study urban spatial structure. Since the selected city- and tract-specific characteristics may be subject to control by policy action and themselves comparatively easily projected on the basis of time, the VCM model can be used for both forecasting and policy analysis even though estimated from cross-sectional data. The results show that questions about the appropriateness of the exponential functional form and specification errors associated with the omission of city- and tract-specific variables can be handled by the VCM model. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the VCM model as a tool for policy analysis and projection.

AB  - Due to continuous world-wide urbanization, especially in developing and emerging countries, urban environment represents one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth. The role of human settlements is becoming more and more important in land management, and the various structures of urban areas differ tremendously depending on social and historical backgrounds. So, beyond land-use and land-cover information, it is the urban composition that explains for social disparities, vulnerability to natural hazards, and deficits in urban and regional planning. In this study, first steps are presented towards and urban structural analysis using a multi-sensoral approach. With very high spatial resolution imageries, remote sensing offers techniques well-applicable to measure and monitor intra-urban heterogeneties. Imageries from Quickbird sensor and TerraSAR-X device, Spotlight mode, are taken to delineate field-mapped and well-defined urban structure types (UST). A robust rule base will be built which allows for accurate classifications and interpretation of typical-man-made structures. The most typical structural characteristics of urban regions are alignment and type of buildings, open and green spaces, and transportation network.

AB  - Most economic activity occurs in cities. This creates a tension between local increasing returns, implied by the existence of cities, and aggregate constant returns, implied by balanced growth. To address this tension, we develop a general equilibrium theory of economic growth in an urban environment. In our theory, variation in the urban structure through the growth, birth, and death of cities is the margin that eliminates local increasing returns to yield constant returns to scale in the aggregate. We show that, consistent with the data, the theory produces a city size distribution that is well approximated by Zipf's law, but that also displays the observed systematic underrepresentation of both very small and very large cities. Using our model, we show that the dispersion of city sizes is consistent with the dispersion of productivity shocks found in the data. CR  - Copyright &#169; 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Ltd.

AB  - Traffic noise in cities has serious effects on the inhabitants. Well-known effects are annoyance and sleep disturbance, but long-term health effects such as cardiovascular disease have also been related to traffic noise. The spatial distribution of traffic noise in a city is related to the distributions of traffic volume and urban density, and also to urban form. This relation is investigated by means of numerical calculations for two cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and for various idealized urban fabrics. The concept of urban traffic elasticity is introduced to relate local population density to local vehicle kilometers driven on the urban road network. The concept of Spacematrix is used to represent urban density and urban form. For the two cities it is found that the average sound level in an urban area decreases with increasing population and building density. The results for idealized urban fabrics show that the shape of buildings blocks has a large effect on the sound level at the least-exposed fa??ade (quiet fa??ade) of a building, and a smaller effect on the sound level at the most-exposed fa??ade. Sound levels at quiet facades are in general lower for closed building blocks than for open blocks such as strips. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Commuting patterns can be recognized by examining urban spatial structure. The latter can also be identified through the investigation of the former. This paper examines how well commuting patterns reflect the corresponding urban spatial structure. For this purpose, locational variables for commuting trip origin and destination are derived and included in an adjusted gravity model. The sign and the magnitude of the coefficients of those variables are interpreted along with the associated urban spatial structure. For a more formal comparison, urban density functions are estimated. Commuting data from the Seoul Metropolitan Region in 1987, 1990, and 1995 are used for an empirical analysis. The result shows that the distribution of employment is consistent between the spatial structure projected from the commuting patterns and the urban density distribution, while the distribution of employed residents is not, suggesting that the latter case should be interpreted with more caution. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Dynamics of urban environments are a challenge to a sustainable development. Urban areas promise wealth, realization of individual dreams and power. Hence, many cities are characterized by a population growth as well as physical development. Traditional, visual mapping and updating of urban structure information of cities is a very laborious and cost-intensive task, especially for large urban areas. For this purpose, we developed a workflow for the extraction of the relevant information by means of object-based image classification. In this manner, multisensoral remote sensing data has been analyzed in terms of very high resolution optical satellite imagery together with height information by a digital surface model to retrieve a detailed 3D city model with the relevant land-use land-cover information. This information has been aggregated on the level of the building block to describe the urban structure by physical indicators. A comparison between the indicators derived by the classification and a reference classification has been accomplished to show the correlation between the individual indicators and a reference classification of urban structure types. The indicators have been used to apply a cluster analysis to group the individual blocks into similar clusters.

AB  - The influence of the scale and diversity of municipal government and of community-wide voluntary associations on the formation of hospital councils was examined in 130 of the largest cities in the United States. These two variables, together with other organizational variables that describe communities accounted for the main part of the explained variance in the formation of hospital councils. They also accounted (1) for the relationship observed here and in other studies between how a community organizes itself for health and how it organizes itself in other spheres, notably with respect to antipoverty programs and (2) for the marketlike conditions under which the need for new interorganizational relations (here for hospital councils) is transformed into demand that brings about their formation. The second finding suggests that the degree of relationship between demand and supply depends upon organizationally induced variations in the marketplace. Both findings indicate that the integrative significance of government and voluntary associations may rest less upon linking individuals to their environment than upon linking organizations to one another, thereby supporting the feasibility of an interorganizational level of analysis.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper distinguishes between cities experiencing high rates of growth and those growing more slowly and argues that it is critically important to take rates of growth into consideration in policy making. Using the examples of Vancouver and Winnipeg, we explore the economic, physical, and political differences associated with their different rates of growth and consider the policy implications of these differences. We critically compare policies pursued by the two cities in five areas: economic development, infrastructure and services. land use, planning for growth, and housing. We argue that both slow and rapid growth have advantages and disadvantages but that policy, especially in slow-growth centers, is often dictated not by a sober assessment of opportunities and constraints but by an unreasoning pursuit of growth at all costs. This pursuit has engendered a way of thinking about urban policy that has affected both city governance and academic urban studies literature.

AB  - The paper explores a framework combining remote sensing and spatial metrics aimed at improving the analysis and modeling of urban growth and land use change. While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales.

The basic approach is to approximate the features of interest with a set of non planar coverage surfaces and to design a motion plan that guarantees the coverage surface is swept completely with a conical-field-of-view sensor. We establish a lower bound on time for a UAV to achieve complete coverage and derive the analytical coverage plan whose duration is a constant times this lower bound. Our hardware-in-the-loop simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Urban scientists are challenged to understand in what ways information technology has influenced the distribution of urban economic activities: concentration or dispersion. Using data collected in the Chicago region, orientation of establishments toward the center is tested to separate the impact of locational features of centers from the impact of information technology. The result reveals that information technology has attraction as well as spillover effect on urban spatial structure and thus concentration rather than dispersion is dominant at a local scale in the Chicago region. It was found, however, that center-orientedness varies depending on the sector.

AB  - This study examined the dynamics of global urban expansion by defining a new universe of 3,943 cities with population in excess of 100,000 and drawing a stratified global sample of 120 cities from this universe. Population data and satellite images for two time periods⎯a decade apart⎯were obtained and analyzed, and several measures of urban extent and expansion⎯among them the built-up area of cities and the average density of the built-up area⎯were calculated. Data for 90 cities out of the global sample of 120 is presented and analyzed in this report. Weighted averages of the built-up area and the average density, as well as compactness and contiguity measures⎯and their change over time⎯are presented for nine regions, four income groups and four city size groups covering the entire globe. Densities in developing-country cities were found to be some three times higher than densities in cities in industrialized countries, and densities in all regions were found to be decreasing over time. If average densities continue to decline at the annual rate of 1.7%⎯as they have during the past decade⎯the built-up area of developing-country cities will increase from 200,000 km2 in 2000 to more than 600,000 km2 by 2030, while their population doubles. Ten econometric models that sought to explain the variation in urban extent and expansion in the universe of cities were constructed, and several hypotheses postulated by neoclassical theories of urban spatial structure were tested. All tests yielded R2 values in excess of 0.80. The policy implications of the analysis are presented and discussed. The Central message of this study is quite clear: Developing country cities should be making realistic⎯yet minimal⎯plans for urban expansion, designating adequate areas for accommodating the projected expansion, investing wisely in basic trunk infrastructure to serve this expansion, and protecting sensitive land from incursion by new urban development.

AB  - While studies of how habitat patch dynamics structures avian communities in urban environments has received some attention, there is considerably less known of how the built environment and human population size may influence the structuring of urban bird communities. We investigated bird populations in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) through replicated point count surveys of breeding birds in 50 parks and cemeteries of varying sizes. We counted 4,435 individual birds in 441 counts. Of the 61 species detected, 27 were rare (detected at <8 points). Migratory species accounted for 46.1 % of all individuals, while 23.2 % of all individuals were of introduced species. Species richness increased significantly with green area size, as did the number of rare species. Species diversity decreased significantly with an increase in the proportion of individuals of introduced species; in particular, cavity nesters were less abundant when introduced species were present. Elements of the built urban environment including commercial development and transportation corridors were associated with significant reductions in park-wide species richness, mean number of species per point, and mean number of individual birds recorded per point. Human population size was positively related to increased numbers of individuals of introduced species, but a lower mean number of species per point. Ours is among the first to identify specific relationships between avian population characteristics and human population size, as few other studies have specifically incorporated human population size into a local, fine grain study design. Our data suggest that human population size is an important parameter that can be measured independently of characteristics of the built environment and the physical characteristics of the park itself as a correlate of avian diversity and abundance. Our study points to a variety of trade-offs needed to manage habitat for birds in urban settings. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

The pattern of concentration of economic activity and its evolution have been found to be an important determinant, and in some cases the result, of urbanization, the structure of cities, the organization of economic activity, and national economic growth. The size distribution of cities is the result of the patterns of urbanization, which result in city growth and city creation. The evolution of the size distribution of cities is in turn closely linked to national economic growth.

The chapter illustrates the potential of DeSC for safeguarding privacy in a dynamic location-based services scenario: Mobile service users protect their potentially sensitive location by the use of a decentralized query algorithms, solely collaborating with peers close by and thereby excluding the privacy bottleneck of an omniscient global service provider. In an extensive set of consecutive experiments several decentralized query algorithms were tested, trading the level of privacy for the quality of service. The use of a real world test bed, - a small part of Ordnance Survey's OS MasterMap (R) Integrated Transport Network (TM) Layer for Southampton - underlines the experiments' validity.

AB  - The basic green infrastructure in urban areas, urban green space typically performs important ecological and socio-economic functions. It is the most important spatial type in the urban planning construction. As the spatial base of the harmony between human and nature in urban area, urban green space is a spatial adjuster that improves the structure and function of urban system and is viewed as an important spatial carrier to guarantee the sustainability of urban development. In this study, Shanghai city was chosen as a case. Based on 689 resident samples, by the support of spatial analysis function of GIS, the amenity value of urban green space was estimated through twenty three variables out of four types of factors (house structure, accessibility, area, landscape metrics) using Hedonic Price Model (HPM). The results showed that; (1) urban green space had amenity value, and the spatial distribution, size and types had significant influence on the price of house, but the influence was different; (2) the residents had the trend to live close to green space, and then there was a ring social pattern around the large green space; (3) the influence of landscape metrics on house price indicated that the pattern of green space was also an important factor; (4) the characters of house structure such as size, age are the basically internal factors, while the extrinsic factors comprise the time to urban center, to the nearest hospital, college, Metro station, in addition to urban green spaces. The amenity value analysis on green space can put forward useful information and reference which can be used for the urban green space plan and urban development strategy plan by urban planners and policy-makers.

AB  - The city-size structure and spatial distribution of the urban system reflect socioeconomic development and its spatial distribution. By tracking the development of the urban system, we can not only monitor the development of the society, but also reveal problems in the process of development and thereby provide a basis for policymaking. Yeh and Xu (1985) analyzed the development of China's urban system between 1949 and 1978. Since 1978 a series of new policies has been introduced, including rural reform, urban reform, establishment of the socialist market system, the opening to the outside world, and emphasis on the development of the coastal region of China. All have contributed to China's emergence as the most rapidly growing economy in the world and have dramatically changed its economic structure and pattern of regional development. Correspondingly, significant changes also have taken place within China's urban system. This paper focuses on new trends in China's urban system between 1978 and 1990 and their relationships with economic development during this period.

The paper is based on data collected through surveys of population censuses and relevant studies. It reveals that the historical process of urban development of Dhaka City presents various trends based on its political development. The rapid urbanisation of the city since its emergence as the capital of an independent state is due mainly to massive migration of rural population. The paper also reveals that significant portions of the city dwellers are settled mostly in slums and squatter settlements and are living below the poverty lines as the rapid urban growth of the city is not commensurate with its overall development. The paper, however, argues that the experience of poverty in the city of Dhaka follows the pattern of urbanisation without development, the opposite of the expectations and aspirations of the poor there.

AB  - According to the standard model of urban traffic congestion and urban spatial structure, congestion tolling results in a more concentrated city. In recent years, a new model of rush-hoururban auto congestion has been delveoped that incorporates trip-timing deicsions - the bottleneck model. In the simplest bottleneck model optimal congestion tolling without toll-revenue redistribution has no effect on trip price because the efficiency gains exactly equal the toll revenue collected. Optimal congestion tolling then has no effect on urban spatial structure. This paper formalizes and extends this result.

AB  - In conjunction with urbanization and its importance as a major driver of land-use change, increased efforts have been placed on understanding urban forests and the provisioning of ecosystem services. However, very little research has been conducted on private property and little is known about the structure and function of privately owned urban forests. This research examines the structure of and carbon storage services provided by private residential urban forests in a moderate-sized Midwestern city. The primary research questions are as follows: What is the structure of private urban forests, and how does it vary across parcels? How much carbon is stored in tree and soil pools of private urban forests, and how does carbon vary across parcels? Ecological inventories were conducted on 100 residential parcels within 14 Neighborhood and Homeowners Associations of varying size and development age. Tree species richness, diversity, density, and diameter distribution were determined on a per parcel basis and for the entire tree population sampled. Further, tree and soil carbon storage were determined for each parcel. Results of this research demonstrated large variability in per-parcel tree metrics. Twelve of the parcels sampled had two or fewer trees, while eleven had greater than 50 trees. Further, tree carbon storage ranged from no carbon to 11.22kgCm-2. Alternatively, soil carbon storage was less variable and averaged 4.7kgCm-2, approximately 1.9 times higher than the average carbon stored in trees (2.5kgCm-2). Management efforts aimed at maintaining or enhancing carbon storage and other ecosystem services should focus on both soil protection and maximizing services in living biomass. Our results demonstrate that sustaining tree-produced ecosystem services requires maintenance of large old trees and species diversity, not only in terms of relative abundance, but also relative dominance, and in combination, species-specific size distributions. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - This paper presents an improved cellular automata (CA) model of urban growth based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach with inertia weight. An innovative feature of this cellular model is the incorporation of swarm intelligence to stochastically optimize the transition rules to reduce the simulation uncertainties and improve its locational accuracy in urban modeling. The similarity between the nature of self-organization of particle swarm optimizers and the bottom-up approach of cellular automata makes PSO particularly suitable to search for the global optimum parameters of CA transition rules. The CA parameters retrieved by the PSO technique are able to express precisely the contributions of various driving forces to urban growth; hence an effective cellular model can be realized for modeling urban dynamics. The PSO based CA model was applied in Fengxian District of Shanghai Municipality, eastern China, to simulate the spatio-temporal process of urban growth from 1992 to 2008 at 30. m spatial resolution. The simulation outcomes, evaluated with error matrix and simulation accuracies, demonstrate that the PSO-CA model outperforms other spatial statistical based CA models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The position of a city in any hierarchy of world importance is not a static phenomenon. This paper takes the example of Tokyo and explores its interaction with the dramatic economic and political events in Japan over the past 20 years. Although Tokyo is widely regarded as one of the top three 'world cities', the argument is supported that it retained many national characteristics, partly based on its location in a 'developmental state'. As national fortunes have changed, so has Tokyo's relationship with its global environment. The paper focuses on strategic urban policy and the way that this reflects Tokyo's world role, as perceived by national and city governments. Three phases in approach are identified since the 1980s. Twenty years ago Japan was experiencing economic boom and this was reflected in dramatic development projects in Tokyo. The concept of 'world city' was used at this time to legitimise such development. The 1990s were viewed in Japan as 'the lost decade' with great uncertainty over policy direction as the boom collapsed and urban policy in Tokyo entered a phase of inertia. It is argued that the city is now entering a third phase in which a new competitive attitude is emerging regarding the role of Tokyo and this is leading to changes in strategic urban policy. However, this new approach is still embedded in old structures and conceptions and hence there are tensions in developing future policy.

AB  - The urban forest provides valuable ecosystem services for enhancing human well-being. Its structure and composition determine the quantity and quality of these services. There has been little research on the heterogeneity in structure and composition of urban forests in the Australasian region, especially in the centre of a highly dynamic and rapidly urbanizing city. This paper quantifies the structure and the composition of the urban forest of Melbourne, Australia's city centre. The effects of land tenure and land use on the heterogeneity of canopy cover, tree density and canopy size were explored. Species and family composition by land use, land ownership and street type were also analysed using the Shannon–Wiener and Jaccard similarity indices. Most of the canopy cover in the city centre is located on public land and is unevenly distributed across the municipality. The mean canopy cover (12.3%) is similar to that found for whole city studies around the world, which often include peri-urban forests. Similarly to other cities, structure varied across different land uses, and tree size, density and cover varied with land tenure and street type. The diversity index shows that the urban forest is rich in species (H′=2.9) and is dominated by native species. Improving the distribution, and increasing tree cover and variety of species will result in a more resilient urban centre, able to provide multiple ecosystem services to their residents and its large population of visitors and workers. The study of the urban centre provides further understanding of compact city morphologies, and allows inter-city comparison independent of the size.

At a census tract level, I verify and extend the finding of Baum-Snow (2007a) that transportation improvements cause suburbanization: (1) improvements to the highway and railroad systems foster population growth in suburban areas; (2) the transit system also affects the location of population inside the central business district (CBD). To estimate the causal relationship between the growth of population (density) and transportation improvements, I rely on an instrumental variables estimation that uses distances to the nearest Roman road, the nearest 19th century main road, and the nearest 19th century railroad network as instruments for the 1991-2001 changes in distance to the nearest highway ramp and the distance to the nearest railroad station. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the spatial distribution of urban growth was uneven. To find out how this unevenness was structured, a GIS-assisted analysis matched spatial reference data (such as distances between individual municipalities and major rivers, roads, international borders and major population centres) against several socioeconomic performance indexes, such as annual population growth, per capita income and expenditures of local municipalities, telephone ownership, number of primary schools and number of industrial plants. The fastest-growing urban localities were found to be close to major population centres, to highways and to the Indian border. The rest exhibited poor socioeconomic performance.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new notion on prominent areas of a city defined by two types of comprehensive prominence for identifying urban spatial structure. Not only geometric attributes and topological attributes but also thematic attributes of irregular areas (e.g. districts of a city) are used to define these indices. In the paper, first the topological prominence related to geometric attributes such as size, location, and shape of areas is constructed by spatial weight matrix. Second, for finding comprehensive prominences, the principle axis factor model is adopted, and the first factor score is defined as the comprehensive prominence 1. Then, the proportion of thematic attributes of each area occupied in across the city is used to define the comprehensive prominence 2. Finally, we use these comprehensive prominences to extract some important regions in Matsudo City of Chiba Prefecture in Japan. The areas composing those regions show a high topological prominence, have a large population, have many offices, and are located around the train station.

AB  - According to the national policy, overall forest and agroforestry cover in Rwanda is to increase up to 30% land cover by 2020. On the other hand, demographic data reveal that Rwanda's urban areas are among the fastest-growing on the continent. Unfortunately, there is only little information of the effects of such a rapid urbanization on tree cover and green space structure, knowing that data on urban plant assemblages in the country are rather rare. The paper discusses developments in Kigali's green spaces with regard to its rapid rate of expansion. An integrated approach of research, combining results from interview sessions, desk-based investigations, walk-over and vegetation surveys, and photogrammetric analyses of remotely acquired imagery was applied. The findings suggest that the city green space network consists of plant assemblages largely dominated by alien species (75%). Tree cover fraction averaged at around 10-35%. No significant difference was observed between field-drawn and photogrammetric-based fraction of tree cover estimates; making the later a quick but cheap tool for rapid tree cover evaluation. Cultivated forests, urban woodlots and domestic garden tree stands are far the most dominant types of green spaces in terms of coverage of city surface area. Street tree communities and institutional gardens appear to be the most intensively designed green space layouts. Both distribution and species composition in domestic gardens were socioeconomic-driven. For instance, palm trees were characteristic of fortunate quarters while fruitbearing ornamental such as Psidium guajava and Persea americana were common within scattered and informal settlements. Markhamia lutea, Erythina abyssinica, Euphorbia candelabrum, Phoenix reclinata and Acacia sieberiana are among native taxa that thrive to keep a place in the city. Euphorbia tirucalli, a native tree that is widespread in home compound fences within informal settlements, is significantly declining as modern housing expands and concrete-based fences replace live enclosures. ?? 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

This article is concerned with testing anecdotal views about the importance of ‘community’ to Ipswich residents and what that might consist of. It draws on exploratory research into local constructions of Ipswich's identity and how rapid growth may be impacting it. As a first stage in the research process, six local leaders were interviewed about their perceptions of the city in this changing urban environment. Across the sample, Ipswich's identity was defined by its sense of community, heritage and history, social and economic growth, geography of place, and local leadership and vision. Participants described a positive transformation of Ipswich's identity overall. This article illuminates elements in Ipswich's identity viewed by participants as of local importance. Ipswich's sense of community was the element participants talked most about preserving in the face of urban growth. Discussed in this article are the study's findings, limitations and potential research directions.

The research on the relationship between them has always been a hot topic to economists, urban geographers and urban planning experts. Especially after the entering of 21st century, various problems have emerged with the rapid development of cities. Therefore, it has become a popular concern for both the government and academic circles about how to use road traffic efficiently to create an intensive urban space structure, thus solving the problems arising during the development of the city. The thesis reviews relevant research achievements about the intensive use of urban space based on road traffic systematically, as well as pointing out the prospect of future development in this field from the following aspects: the influences road traffic has on both urban exterior spatial pattern and urban interior spatial structure; the effects urban space has on road traffic and the urban space planning oriented to the road traffic.

Assuming consumers minimize costs in choosing between competing travel modes, the 19-equation model demonstrates that land rent differentials are diminished by adding an alternative travel mode, and that transport capacity is far more important than fare structures in determining transit patterns and land use. American urban structure appears to resemble European urban patterns as transportation modes proliferate.

AB  - In this paper we describe our novel use of space syntax for the design and development of pervasive systems. Pervasive systems are computer systems that are designed to be “invisible” to users because they are designed to blend in with their environment and become part of the fabric of everyday life. Pervasive systems consist of fixed, mobile and embedded components, each of which may entail interactive capabilities and intelligence. Due to their close relationship with the build environment, pervasive systems are an ideal domain for adopting a space syntax methodology. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we present an adaptation of the space syntax methodology aimed at researchers and designers of space and pervasive systems. By developing an adaptation of the space syntax methodology we intend for space syntax to be added the arsenal of tools and theo- ries that researchers use to understand and design pervasive systems. To exem- plify how this can be achieved, we present three case studies that demonstrate cru- cial ways in which space syntax analysis can aid the design of pervasive systems. The case studies presented here show how space syntax can be used in the devel- opment of pervasive system as an application development tool, as an exploratory tool, and as a modelling tool.

AB  - The debate over urban consolidation in Australia has generally ignored the issue of density in the outer urban suburbs of Australian cities, an omission that has led to a serious inconsistency in policy. Governments are emphasising the need for urban intensification in established areas of cities while continuing to allow outer urban areas to be developed at average densities that are among the lowest in the world. Deregulatory policies of the 1990s and an increased reliance on markets have led to increased levels of medium density and high-rise development in Melbourne's inner suburbs and CBD, and broad-scale development in outer suburbs at very low densities. In the process, development companies became the primary determiners of urban form in both inner and outer areas. At the urban fringe, they largely continue to regard intensification, changes to hierarchical retail structures and a reversion to more traditional forms of urban design as a higher commercial risk than proven business-as-usual approaches. This study seeks to place the issue of outer urban densities on the planning agenda of state and local governments. Unless current practices are changed in Melbourne, land set aside in outer urban areas will be used up for housing faster than necessary, and large areas of land squandered. The failure to increase densities in outer urban growth areas will jeopardise compliance with Melbourne 2030 (DOI, 2002a) objectives by preventing the achievement of growth targets in activity centres, and by leading to renewed pressure to remove or substantially alter the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and allow further residential development in Melbourne's green bel

AB  - Urban green space, such as parks, forests, green roofs, streams, and community gardens, provides critical ecosystem services. Green space also promotes physical activity, psychological well-being, and the general public health of urban residents. This paper reviews the Anglo-American literature on urban green space, especially parks, and compares efforts to green US and Chinese cities. Most studies reveal that the distribution of such space often disproportionately benefits predominantly White and more affluent communities. Access to green space is therefore increasingly recognized as an environmental justice issue. Many US cities have implemented strategies to increase the supply of urban green space, especially in park-poor neighborhoods. Strategies include greening of remnant urban land and reuse of obsolete or underutilized transportation infrastructure. Similar strategies are being employed in Chinese cities where there is more state control of land supply but similar market incentives for urban greening. In both contexts, however, urban green space strategies may be paradoxical: while the creation of new green space to address environmental justice problems can make neighborhoods healthier and more esthetically attractive, it also can increase housing costs and property values. Ultimately, this can lead to gentrification and a displacement of the very residents the green space strategies were designed to benefit. Urban planners, designers, and ecologists, therefore, need to focus on urban green space strategies that are 'just green enough' and that explicitly protect social as well as ecological sustainability. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We develop an urban-search model in which firms post wages. When all workers are identical, there is a unique wage in equilibrium even in the presence of search and spatial frictions. This wage is affected by spatial and labor costs. When workers differ according to the value imputed to leisure, we show that, under some conditions, two wages emerge in equilibrium. The commuting cost not only affects the land market but also the labor market through wages. Workers' productivity also affects housing prices and this impact can be positive or negative depending on the location in the city. We then run some numerical simulations to reproduce some stylized facts about the labor-market outcomes of black and white workers. We find that a reduction in commuting costs for all workers reduces the unemployment rate of white workers and the profit of all firms but increases the wage of all workers (black and white) and raises the fraction of firms posting the high wage. © The Author (2009).

Some issues were solved and others remain to be solved. If Tokyo is evaluated as one of the most efficient, productive and sustainable mega-regions in the world, it is the result of rapid urban growth and development in the twentieth century. After that, Tokyo has been facing new challenges as it left the phase of rapid growth and entered the phase of no- or low-growth, depopulating and aging society. In this respect, Tokyo is a leading or an instructive mega-region in the world. At the same time, Tokyo must take part in the global effort to achieve sustainability.

AB  - Studying urban population and spatial structure using aggregate census data suffers from problems of spatial aggregation and temporal comparability, particularly for the rapidly changing cities of China. The development in GIS has potential to represent population distribution in a continuous field with grid cells using surface model techniques, which is a more accurate representation of population distribution. This paper attempts to better model and analyze population distribution, using Nanjing, China as a case. With the aids of the detailed urban land use and building distribution data, I develop an alternative method to generate population surface, and uncover spatial variations of population distribution in Nanjing. I found that despite suburbanization, Nanjing remains a compact city, and population density declines quickly with the increase of the distance to the CBD. I also use exploratory spatial data analysis to investigate spatial associations between non-residential land uses and population density, and have found significant influence of commercial activities on population distribution. Industrial suburbanization, however, does not have significant effects on population suburbanization.

AB  - Urban expansion has been a hot topic not only in the management of sustainable development but also in the fields of remote sensing and geographic information science (GIS). After land reform initiated in 1987, Chinese cities are facing a new development wave, which is the mixture of urban expansion and redevelopment. Local urban planners are also facing a huge challenge to require the understanding of complex urban growth process, which involves various actors with different patterns of behavior. Modeling an urban development pattern is the prerequisite to understanding the process. This paper presents a spatial data analysis method to seek and model major determinants of urban growth in the period 1993-2000 by a case study of Wuhan City in PR China. The method comprises exploratory data analysis and spatial logistic regression technique. The former is able to visually explore the spatial impacts of each explanatory variable. The latter can provide a systematic confirmatory approach to comparing the variables. The study shows that the major determinants are urban road infrastructure and developed area, and master planning is losing its role in the specific period. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The literature on the relationship between city size and urban wages argues that productivity and wages are higher in larger cities. Indeed, a doubling of city size is associated with a 4-8 per cent increase in wages. The human capital externalities literature finds evidence of higher wages in cities with an abundant supply of human capital where knowledge spillovers are plentiful. Interestingly, cities with a large supply of human capital are not themselves large. They have a population of fewer than 1.5 million inhabitants. In view of this evidence, this paper questions whether city size has lost its importance as a determinant of high wages. In other words, is city size necessary to explain wage variations, after controlling for knowledge spillovers? Using a large sample from the 5 per cent PUMS of the 2000 US Census, this paper presents econometric evidence for city size and learning spillover effects on productivity. According to the estimates presented, every additional 100 000 inhabitants in the local labour market raises individual hourly wages by 0.12 per cent. Moreover, a doubling of the human capital density in a metropolitan area results in approximately a 2 per cent increase in average individual hourly wages.

Together with the previous conditions, it is suggested that it is necessary to include another which represents a structural element of an urban sub-system within the metropolitan configuration-that is, a place with intense spatial interaction with its hinterland. Therefore, a metropolitan area can be seen as one comprising urban sub-systems characterised by greater or lesser polycentrism. In this paper, a 'bottom-up' methodology based on commuter flows is proposed in order to detect metropolitan sub-centres. Using empirical data from the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, the proposed methodology is tested, comparing its results with those of other commonly used methodologies (cut-offs, parametric and non-parametric models). The results suggest that the proposed methodology permits optimising the sub-centre delimitation process.

AB  - Different discipline-specific methodological approaches to assess the vulnerability of the "urban environment" to climate change risks require a commonly accepted spatial working basis, which can ensure that the resulting heterogeneous investigations can be transdisciplinarily integrated by using an adequate spatially explicit classification. Therefore an 'urban typology' concept was developed and will be used as a practicable method to structure the spatial order of the sensitivity of settlement areas in HCMC. The Housingrelated 'urban typology' provides a uniform methodological and spatial framework for the different tasks within the interdisciplinary network of the research project to aid the development of future climate change resilience- Building and thus resilience- Urban Structure. The case study is based on initial research experiences of the development of GIS-based vulnerability indicators in the application area of adaptation of a high-risk agglomeration area to the future impacts of Climate Change. Based on the extended Urban Structure Type (UST) approach(HAGGAG & AYAD 2002). The proposed model represents an interpretative method to respond and adapt to the impacts of climate change. It focuses on how to integrate climate change risks and hazards with information and indicators that describe both the exposure and sensitivity of the highly-dense urban areas of Asian megacities such as Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam.

AB  - Traditionally, city classification studies have been considered descriptive. Empirical results have typically not been applied to explain or predict other urban characteristics. This pattern was reversed in the 1980s by the application of the results of two well-known classification studies as independent variables in a regression analysis. In performing statistical inference, it was implicitly assumed that the classifications provide measures of unobservable theoretical constructs. In this paper, it is argued that knowledge of a classification's validity is required prior to performing such inference. An example of a construct validation is provided by proposing that the physical and spatial characteristics of urban areas may in part be described by four independent dimensions and an attempt is made to operationalise and validate appropriate measures. -Author

AB  - A functional network of green space is important for the maintenance of the ecological dimension of a sustainable urban landscape. We used avian ecological diversity as a proxy for evaluating the functionality of different types of urban green space. The urban landscape of the municipality of +�rebro in Sweden was stratified into four strata (City centre, Residential, Greenway and Periphery). Bird species found in these strata were classified into four ecological groups with decreasing degree of specialisation (woodpeckers, hole-nesters, forest birds and urban birds). Overall there was lower bird species richness in the City centre and Residential areas compared to the Greenway and Periphery. Woodpeckers, hole-nesters and forest birds showed an increasing trend in the number of species as well as individuals from the City centre to the Periphery while urban birds showed the opposite trend. The amount and quality of green space as well as natural vegetation increased from the City centre to the Periphery. Species richness of woodpeckers, forest birds and hole-nesters were positively correlated with tree density while urban birds showed an inverse correlation. There was no dead wood in City centre, Residential and Greenway in contrast to the Periphery, which held some dying trees, stumps and old windthrows. Our findings emphasise the importance of urban green space with natural structures to maintain high ecological diversity. Finally, we discuss how conflicts between habitat for biodiversity maintenance and other functions of green space could be handled by zoning

AB  - The detection and analysis of land use changes in the urban environment is an important issue in planning. Remote sensing and geographic information systems are considered as the most efficient techniques for this type of studies. These techniques had been applied to investigate the effects of urbanization on fertile lands and to quantify urban growth of Amman area. Five land covers were identified in space and time using aerial photographs, LANDSAT and IKONOS images acquired at different dates. The study showed that the urban area was increased by 162 km2 over the period 1918–2002, which represents 509 times the original urban area. The fertile lands decreased by 86 km2, which represents 23% of loss. Moreover, the urban expansion over 1918–2002 was analyzed and its impacts on the Amman area environment were assessed. The results of our study were compared to other similar studies for Istanbul and Bangkok. The comparison showed that Amman has the largest percent annual rate of urban expansion

AB  - Revealing spatially varying relationships between urban growth patterns and underlying determinants is important for better understanding local dimensions of urban development. Through a case study of Nanjing, China, we employ both global and local logistic regressions to model the probability of urban land expansion against a set of spatial variables. We found that compared with other fast growing coastal cities, Nanjing remains a relatively compact city. The orthodox logistic regression found the significance of proximity, neighborhood conditions, and urban agglomeration in urban land change. The logistic GWR significantly improves the global logistic regression model in terms of better model goodness-of-fit and lower level of spatial autocorrelation of residuals. More importantly, the local estimates of parameters of spatial variables enable us to investigate spatial variations of the influences of spatial variables on urban growth. We have found distinctive local patterns and effects of urban growth in Nanjing, shaped by local urban spatial and institutional structures. A probability surface of urban growth, which is generated from raster calculations among the parameter and variable surfaces, provides a clear scenario of urban growth patterns and can be useful for decision making. This study also shows the importance of policy studies and fieldwork in the interpretation of results generated from statistical and GIS modeling.

AB  - Urban green space is the main part of urban green infrastructure, regarded as the important spatial basis for urban sustainable development, and can provide ecological, recreational and social-cultural functions. Since 1980s, the urban planners and policy-makers widely took the urban green space area per capita, public green space area per capita, urban park area per capita, the ratio of urban green space, and green space cover ratio, etc. as the key indexes to guide planning and management in China. However, only a few indexes reflecting the spatial allocation and structure of urban green space are used, and few policy-makers and planners pay attention to the spatial equity of urban green space service functions. Since the Reform and Open Policy were initiated in the 1980s, Chinese cities have been facing rapid urban sprawl, but most of the cities implemented green space planning in the 1990s. So, the number of patches and area of urban green space in Chinese cities could not satisfy the increasing demands of citizens. With socio-economic development, Chinese people and governments are paying much more attention to urban green space, and more and more citizens have the desire for contact with nature, and are willing to live close to urban green space. Consequently, governments plan to develop and optimize urban green space allocation to meet these demands. Quantification of accessibility and equity of urban green space is a prerequisite to assess them as a tool for decision-making in planning. However, GIS-based accessibility and equity analysis has not yet been used to evaluate the accessibility and equity of urban green space in China. Chinese planners have been unable to give spatial accessibility and equity of urban green space a comprehensive evaluation, so their plans based on their experience could be arbitrary. In this paper, supported by GIS, the new study frame for assessing the social function of urban green space is established, within which, the accessibility and equity indexes are used to analyze the rationality of the urban green space spatial structure, through a case study of Shanghai and Qingdao city, China. Results demonstrate that: (1) the accessibility and equity indexes are effective to appraise the structure of urban green space, and using the new study frame to guide the planning and management of urban green space is feasible; (2) when the indexes are used, the study area and scale, especially the data resolution need to be defined to compare the temporal data series in the study area or with the other cities. The new frame in this paper will enrich the key index system for assessing the urban green space in China, and can provide planners and policy-makers with important and valuable information that can be used in urban green space planning and assessment.

AB  - Urban growth analysis and simulation have been recently conducted by cellular automata (CA) models based on self-organizing theory which differs from system dynamics models. This paper describes the Beijing urban development model (BUDEM) which adopts the CA approach to support urban planning and policy evaluation. BUDEM, as a spatio-temporal dynamic model for simulating urban growth in the Bei- jing metropolitan area, is based on the urban growth theory and integrates logistic regression and MonoLoop to obtain the weights for the transition rule with multi-criteria evaluation configuration. Local sen- sitivity analysis for all the parameters of BUDEM is also carried out to assess the model’s performances. The model is used to identify urban growth mechanisms in the various historical phases since 1986, to re- trieve urban growth policies needed to implement the desired (planned) urban form in 2020, and to simulate urban growth scenarios until 2049 based on the urban form and parameter set in 2020. The model has been proved to be capable of analyzing historical urban growth mechanisms and predicting future urban growth for metropolitan areas in China.

Undefined suburban mess has consumed vast areas of land and degraded picturesque German landscapes. The new interest in strengthening local identities coincides with national priorities to enhance the cultural and natural heritage. Policies for quality growth at the city's edge evolve through a series of steps, including the community's vision statements, comprehensive master planning, environmental prioritization of potential development sites, and land banking for mitigation of future impacts. The merits of high density urban form with strategically placed 'hard' and 'soft' edges include preservation of landscape with special environmental and scenic value; proximity of residential and recreational areas; convenient and car-free transit; and openness contrasts with urban density.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical test of a hypothesis derived from a theoretical urban growth model developed by Brueckner and von Rabenau (1981). The model portrays a monocentric city with radial commuting where housing developers choose among a number of infinite-horizon land-use strategies with the knowledge that the urban population will change discontinuously at a future date τ. The model suggests that a large population increase will raise housing prices sufficiently to make it worthwhile for developers to replace old centrally-located structures at τ. When population increases moderately or declines, replacement will not be optimal and original structures will be left standing forever. Regression results relating 1970 central-city building ages to prior urbanized area population growth confirm the existence of the inverse relationship between building ages and prior growth predicted by the theory.

AB  - Evaluation of urban planning implementation (UPI) has attracted extensive attention from urban planners and researchers in recent years. Existing literature, however, mainly focuses on the conformity approach and does not take the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of UPI into account. In addition, previous research failed to distinguish the effects of urban planning from other institutional forces, as well as market incentives on urban expansion. To bridge this gap, we proposed a spatiotemporal approach to evaluate the effectiveness of UPI based on logistic regression and geographical information system (GIS) by identifying the spatiotemporal heterogeneous effects of urban planning on urban expansion. An empirical research was conducted in the Beijing Metropolitan Area (BMA) by analyzing five urban master plans drafted in 1958, 1973, 1982, 1992 and 2004. Five periods from 1947 to 2008 were examined to evaluate the dynamic effects of each master plan and other related factors. The effects of the 2004 Urban Master Plan on 16 districts in Beijing were estimated to identify the spatial variations of UPI. Within the context of China's booming economy, the results indicate that the effects of urban planning during the urban expansion increase over time, and are significantly stronger in exurban areas than in central cities and suburban areas. In addition, based on logistic regression results, we adopted an existing urban expansion simulation model to geographically visualize the impact of urban planning on future urban expansion, namely urban planning implementation effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

We use a version of the Alonso-Muth-Mills model, calibrated to broadly match some of the features of a representative large city. Although the calibrated model omits many real-world features, it can nonetheless be used to explore the impact of factors such as: (i) the provision of transport infrastructure; (ii) zoning policies that limit housing density; (iii) frictions on the production of housing; and (iv) population size. The empirical section of the article shows that the model is consistent with some empirical regularities for large Australian cities. The results of the article draw attention to structural factors that may have contributed to developments in the Australian housing market in recent years.

AB  - The preservation of riparian zones and other environmentally sensitive areas has long been recognized as one of the most cost-effective methods of managing stormwater and providing a broad range of ecosystem services. In this research, a cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain model of land cover change was developed to integrate protection of environmentally sensitive areas into urban growth projections at a regional scale. The baseline scenario is a continuation of the current trends and involves only limited constraints on development. The green infrastructure (GI) conservation scenario incorporates an open space conservation network based on the functional boundaries of environmentally sensitive areas. It includes variable buffer widths for impaired streams (as identified on the USEPA 303d list for stream impairment), 100-year floodplain, wetlands, urban open space and steep slopes. Comparative analysis of each scenario with landscape metrics indicated that under the GI conservation scenario, the number of urban patches decreased while the extent of interspersion of urban land with green infrastructure patches increased leading to improved connectivity among open space features. The analysis provides a quantitative illustration of how our process contributes towards achieving urban planning objectives while incorporating green infrastructure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is demonstrated that an improvement in some transport facility will not necessarily increase the welfare level of every household, and, at times decreases the welfare of some households. It also is argued that under particular situations, an improvement in a particular transport mode may produce a contraction in the city size rather than an expansion. Similarly, an increase in income of one group might have an adverse effect on the welfare of another income group as a result of competition in the land market. © 1990.

AB  - Identifying the spatial structure generated by urban movements contributes to a better understanding of urban dynamics and is crucial to urban planning applications. Despite a number of studies concerning functional urban space, related research is still in a development phase, especially using emerging urban movement data. This study proposes a centrality index and attractiveness indices for detecting the urban spatial structure of functional centers and their spatial impacts using transportation data. The basic idea of these indices is to build a relationship between the activity patterns (distribution, density, and diversity) and urban form. Accordingly, measurements, spatial analysis, and clustering methods are presented. Taking Singapore as a case study area, we applied the proposed indices and measurements to travel survey data of different years, through which centers of urban activities as well as the changing urban form are detected and compared quantitatively. Our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a novel way of quantitative urban analysis and explicit urban change identification.

AB  - A quite robust model of differential growth rates of per capita income in the major functional urban regions of the European Union is presented and tested for the 1980s. The results underline the important role of purely spatial economic processes in differential regional growth and suggest that the pattern of European urbanisation tends itself to generate systematic divergence of mean per capita incomes between neighbouring city-regions, even though the mechanism generating this divergence of mean incomes is not inconsistent with converging incomes for comparable individuals. In addition, the evidence is supportive of a spatial adaptation of Romer's endogenous technical progress model. The model is formulated in a way which tests policy concerns. In general, the results are supportive of European regional policy although the systematic spatial effects of European integration seem to be fading and extending outwards to near-peripheral urban regions.

Officers from the Crime Suppression Division and the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police have arrested a Thai man and a Vietnamese man in connection with the crime. All three species are protected in Thailand, and are all listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The animals, found chopped up and stuffed into a freezer in the house, were believed to have been sourced from Malaysia and moved through Sadao, a district in the southern Thai province of Songkla, which shares a border with Malaysia.  Initial investigations have shown the animals were bound for China via Nong Khai, a town near the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.   From Nong Khai, the animals were to be transported across the Mekong River to Lao PDR before being moved to China.  Police said the suspects were paid 8,000 Baht (USD250) to transport the animals from the south of Thailand to Bangkok.  The seized animals have been handed over to the Wildlife First Aid Clinic where samples will be taken for DNA analysis.  “Any DNA analysis should be undertaken with an eye toward establishing the origins of these animals. Going forward, it will be important to know exactly where they came from.” noted TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director, Dr. William Schaedla.  “We also hope the Thai authorities will undertake a thorough investigation of the transport routes being utilized by the smugglers and co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighboring countries. Simply seizing dead animals will not be enough to prevent future losses of tigers and other endangered animals to wildlife trafficking.”  For further images of the haul, please contact Richard Thomas, +44 752 6646216, richard.thomas@traffic.org.

This process entails adopting commonly understood definitions of urban forest structure and urban boundaries. Urban forest structure is determined by three broad factors: urban morphology, which creates the spaces available for vegetation, natural factors, which influence the amount and types of biomass likely to be found within cities, and human management systems, which account for intraurban variations in biomass configurations according to land use distributions. Together these factors provide an explanation for urban forest structure and enhance our ability to predict structure from limited information.

AB  - Why some cities grow while others decline in population is a relevant question for public policy. Although there are many theories about why metropolitan areas develop, very few of these concepts have been empitically applied. In this paper, several empirical models of urban and regional growth are examined in terms of postulated causes of growth. In particular, the role of migration as a cause or consequence of development is emphasized. It is concluded that these models take a very narrow view of the growth process and that a promising area of future research lies in models of urban labour market dynamics.

AB  - A recent study in Frederikshavn, Denmark, shows that urban structural variables influence travel behaviour, even in a small town of around 30 000 inhabitants. As might be expected, socio-economic and attitudinal factors play a role in the respondents' travelling patterns. However, when controlling for these factors and a range of other potential explanatory variables, clear relationships are also found between urban structural characteristics and travel activity. These relationships exist across most subgroups of the population. The statistical relationships found between urban structure and travel behaviour are confirmed in qualitative interviews. The distance from the residence to the downtown area is a key factor influencing the accessibility to a number of facilities. These differences in accessibility result in corresponding differences in the actual travelling distances and modal split.

Compared to the classical planning approach based on socio-economic land suitability, the principles of landscape ecology are helpful simultaneously conserving the ecological processes of landscapes and their steady changes. This approach could help in defining sustainable landscape development, aiming for a balance between both physical and natural systems in urban areas. This research is focused on the ecological networks in Tehran’s metropolitan area as a case study to provide a model for network planning in other urban areas, where urbanization seriously threats the natural environment. In concluding this research, the spatial structure and function of the area are studied and categorized based on the patch-corridor-matrix model.

AB  - The interactions between the structure of a city and the atmosphere have an impact on thermal comfort, air quality and building energy consumption for space heating and cooling. A mesoscale model, with a multilayer urban canopy parameterization, coupled with a simple building energy model is used to investigate such interactions by simulating 22 idealized cities in 3D with the same total population, but different population densities and vegetation fraction in the urban areas. Simulations are performed for summer and winter periods at mid latitude and for a hot dry climate. Results indicate that compact cities, with buildings with low surface-to-volume ratios, minimize the building energy consumption for space heating/cooling, but maximize the outdoor heat stress. For air quality, the optimum is for cities with intermediate population densities. The inclusion of vegetation is most of the time positive, and never detrimental, in this climate. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents a quantitative assessment of the environmental consequences of urbanization in general and city bigness in particular in the context of the process of economic development. We focus attention on the relationship between ambient air quality and city size, and how it might differ between urban areas of developed and developing countries. First, the air pollution-city size relationship is characterized theoretically and explored empirically using ambient air quality data for various urban zones across an international sample of cities. While we find statistically significant relationships between pollution and city size, interesting developed-developing country differences emerge. Next, the relationship is re-estimated using contextual development covariates. Results show that the positive association between poor air quality and city size is not inevitable and tends to diminish with economic growth and the capacity for undertaking pollution abatement measures. It follows that restricting urban growth in developing countries may be neither necessary nor sufficient for achieving environmental gains.

AB  - Urban structure influences directly or indirectly the majority of all green house gas (GHG) emissions in cities. The prevailing belief is that dense metropolitan areas produce less carbon emissions on a per capita basis than less dense surrounding rural areas. Consequently, density targets have a major role in low-carbon urban developments. However, based on the results of this study, the connection seems unclear or even nonexistent when comprehensive evaluation is made. In this letter, we propose a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) method for calculating the consumption-based carbon footprints in metropolitan areas, i.e. carbon consumption, with the emphasis on urban structures. The method is input–output-based hybrid LCA, which operates with the existing data from the region. The study is conducted by performing an analysis of the carbon consumption in two metropolitan areas in Finland, including 11 cities. Both areas consist of a dense city core and a less dense surrounding suburban area. The paper will illustrate that the influence of urban density on carbon emissions is insignificant in the selected metropolitan areas. In addition, the utilized consumption-based method links the climate effects of city-level development to the global production of emissions.

Firstly, the spectral characteristics of different features in all bands were analyzed and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI) was employed to extract part green space and eliminate other features meanwhile, such as buildings in non-shadow area, part roads in shadow area. Then, based on the different spectral features, the roads and bushes which are in non-shadow areas were extracted and eliminated hierarchically. Finally, variance of textural feature information was employed in post processing and green spaces in shadow area were extracted. The results indicated that the method is an effective way to extract green space in shadow.

AB  - This study examined native bird communities in forest patches across a gradient  of urbanization. We used field data and multivariate statistical techniques to examine the  effects of landscape context, roads, traffic noise, and vegetation characteristics on bird  community composition in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A.). Landscape-level  variables, particularly those related to urbanization, were most important in structuring  forest bird communities. Specifically, we found that road density and amount of urban land  cover were the best predictors of species composition. We found that urban and rural bird  communities were quite distinct from each other. Rural communities had more long-  distance migrants and forest interior species but species richness did not differ between the  communities. Our results suggest some specific guidelines to target bird species of interest  both inside and outside of urban areas. For example, if increasing numbers of migratory  species is of primary concern, then conservation areas should be located outside of urban  boundaries or in areas with low road density. However, if maximizing species richness is  the focus, location of the conservation area may not be as important if the conservation area  is surrounded by at least 50 m of forest habitat in all directions.

AB  - Contemporary urban studies approaching disciplines of Urban Ecology, Ecology of Landscape and Urban Planning have indicated the city as an ecosystem with resilience properties. Morphologic selforganization movements, natural landscape articulated and inherent in urban growth dynamics, can be assumed as urban resilience mechanisms. From systems framework, this paper explores the relationships between urban growth dynamics and natural landscape, by three distinct scientific bases: theoretical, empirical and methodological. The main aim is to outline a dynamic of urban growth articulated to natural landscape. Water resources are indicated as tipping point to phase transitions in urban growth morphologies. This theoretical statement is applied in simulation urban growth model SACI (City Environment Simulator), which apply in a dynamic cellular automaton the potential-centrality model (Krafta, 1994). The urban modeling mechanism captures the "edge effect" on water resources buffers, self distributing urban growth tensions, axial and diffuse. Associated with urban modeling, the theoretical statement could be empirically tested in simulations, replicating the urban growth reality of Pelotas city (1815-1965). This work helps to overcome pessimist visions about the urban phenomenon and the future of cities, approaching city by viewpoints as a richest human artifact, with intrinsic expansion dynamics associated with resilience and permanence properties over time; one way to coexisting urban systems and natural resources.

AB  - This article uses a case study of Spokane, Washington’s preparations for Expo ’74 to examine the environmental dimensions of urban renewal. Scholars often think of urban renewal as a planning project influenced by distinct racial exclusion, economic development, and urban design strategies. However, this article shows how environmental strategies—particularly the rise of urban environmentalism and the production of urban green space—had on urban renewal processes. As Spokane’s downtown elites planned for the environmentally themed World’s Fair, they used environmental strategies not only to promote the fair and the city but also to displace low-income residents and transform the downtown riverfront landscape. Understanding how the environment has been used by powerful groups as a tool of social power not only yields insights into the history of urban renewal in the 1960s and early 1970s but also highlights potential pitfalls in contemporary urban sustainability planning.

AB  - Today, most people live and work in cities and as a result, most social and economic issues have a significant urban dimension. Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding where and how residential location affects urban activity, yet little of this effort has been directed to work and what determines location choices in cities. This study addresses this question by providing a theory based on modern labor economics, which complements the residential location theory at the core of recent urban studies. It analyzes the importance of workplace location in assessing matters of spatial structure, commuting patterns, underemployment, and the formation of urban ghettoes. The book lucidly blends theoretical analysis with empirical evidence, especially that from transportation survey data.

AB  - Basic to several key issues in current urban economic theory and public policy is a presumption that local imbalances between employment and residential sites strongly influence people's commuting patterns. We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of job and housing locations. We find that the amount of commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across job locations only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting.

AB  - AbstractUrban land-use planning is becoming increasingly complex in China because it requires estimating the future urban extent and balancing its various aspects, e.g., provision of enough housing and employment opportunities and preservation of the environment. This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system. In addition to these nonspatial goals, objectives concerning the spatial distrib...

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most evident global changes. Research in the field of urban growth modelling has generated models that explore for drivers and components of the urban growth dynamics. Cellular automata (CA) modeling is one of the recent advances, and a number of CA-based models of urban growth have produced satisfactory simulations of spatial urban expansion over time. Most application and test of CA-based models of urban growth which provide likely and reliable simulations has been developed in urban regions of developed nations; urban regions in the United States, in particular. This is because most of the models were developed in universities and research centers of developed nations, and these regions have the required data, which is extensive. Most of the population growth in the world, however, occurs in the developing world. While some European countries show signs of stabilization of their population, in less developed countries, such as India, population still grows exponentially. And this growth is normally uncoordinated, which results in serious environmental and social problems in urban areas. Therefore, the use of existing dynamic-spatial models of urban growth in regions of developing nations could be a means to assist planners and decision makers of these regions to understand and simulate the process of urban growth and test the results of different development strategies. The pattern of growth of urban regions of developing nations, however, seems to be different of the pattern of developed countries. The former use to be more dense and centralized, normally expanding outwards from consolidated urban areas; while the second is normally more fragmented and sparse. The present paper aims to investigate to how extent existing CA-based urban growth models tested in developed nations can also be applied to a developing country urban area. The urban growth model was applied to Porto Alegre City, Brazil. An expected contiguous expansion from existing urban areas has been obtained as following the historical trends of growth of the region. Moreover, the model was sensitive and able to portray different pattern of growth in the study area by changing the value of its parameters.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a simple theoretical framework to compute optimal urban-rail station spacing, first with a one- and then with a two-dimensional population density distribution. For small numbers of stations, numerical methods maximising total passenger-km give the optimal spacings, and it is found that stations should indeed be significantly more dispersed in the suburbs. The fixed nature of station infrastructure, however, means that as urban density patterns evolve, the stations will progressively become located in the wrong positions, with associated efficiency losses. Numerical methods are also used to estimate the seriousness of these efficiency losses in the simplest cases. The findings on station spacing are compared with the urban-rail systems of London, Munich, Paris and Washington, DC.

Compared to the classical planning approach based on socio-economic land suitability, the principles of landscape ecology are helpful simulta- neously conserving the ecological processes of landscapes and their steady changes. This approach could help in defining sustainable landscape development, aiming for a balance between both physical and natural systems in urban areas. This research is focused on the ecological networks in Tehran’s metropolitan area as a case study to provide a model for network planning in other urban areas, where urbanization seriously threats the natural environment. In concluding this research, the spatial structure and function of the area are studied and categorized based on the patch-corridor-matrix model.

AB  - This paper developed a method to assess the appropriateness of urban structure via evaluating the accessibility of public transportation. Through a validated accessibility index, it combined the physical setting of urban environments with the residents' satisfactions toward public transportation. Taking Beijing as an example, this paper first analyzed the influencing factors of the accessibility of public transportation from three perspectives including public service, local development status, transportation and road construction. Then, it built a hierarchical logistic regression model of satisfaction. It was found that the satisfaction of people varied spatially, with the marginal effect of within the 5th Ring Road being lower than that outside the 5th Ring Road. The connectivity to the main places of the city by public transportation, and the density of bus stops within a distance of 800 m were found to have significantly affected the satisfaction of people toward public transportation. In addition, people of different attributes valued differently. The results had implications for improving the transportation environment of Beijing. (1) At present, the investment of public transportation should focus on the areas in the built-up areas inside the 5th Ring Road rather than the suburban areas. (2) It is socially desirable that the 800-m-service areas of bus stops cover the whole city; and according to the function of various areas, the optimal density of bus stops should be different. (3) The connectivity to the main function nodes of the city by public transportation should top the agenda on the planning of bus lines, as it can substantially improve the efficiency of public transportation system and the satisfaction of the people. (4) The spatial distribution of the people with different attributes such as age and income should be taken into account when local public transportation policies are made.

AB  - Urban growth patterns are characteristic of spatial changes that take place in metropolitan areas (MA). They are particularly prominent in more recently formed MAs, such as those in certain locations in Spain, where the structure of the traditional city has undergone sweeping changes. Given the capacity of spatial metrics to characterize landscape structure, these metrics can be a valuable instrument to identify growth patterns in MAs and to evaluate possible urban growth options, based on spatial characteristics. This article focuses on a medium-sized MA (Granada, Spain), and explores the use of spatial metrics to quantify changes in the urban growth patterns reflected in three future scenarios (2020). The scenarios were simulated with a model based on cellular automata, which reproduced three urban growth processes (aggregation, compaction, and dispersion) and four urban growth patterns (aggregated, linear, leapfrogging, and nodal). The scenarios were evaluated with metrics that quantified changes in the spatial characteristics of urban processes. Thus, for example, the NP and AREA MN allowed us to characterize the decreased aggregation of high-density residential land uses in one scenario (S1) and the linear growth patterns in industrial land uses in another scenario (S2). In this way, spatial metrics were found to be useful for the evaluation of urban planning.

AB  - This is an empirical quantitative study that uses urban demographic data to identify economic change in cities. Unlike previous demographic studies, a strong theoretical framework is provided for the analysis. The research is designed and interpreted through Jacobs's theory of the city as economic process within the framework of Wallerstein's modern world-system. This is the first time Jacobs's theory has been subject to systematic inquiry over big time and big space. We create an inventory of 184 examples of Jacobs's "explosive growth" from 1500 to 2005 within the modern world-system. These results are interpreted in terms of systemic hegemonic cycles with first Dutch, and then British, and finally U.S. cities dominating the inventory lists. It is found that Dutch, British and U.S. city growth spurts are front-loaded in their respective hegemonic cycles: this is strong evidence of hegemony being created and initially sustained through and by these dynamic cities. This study makes a direct contribution to developing world-systems analysis, and in a short conclusion future research on ways of contributing to Jacobs's theory of the city are discussed.

AB  - Cities play an important role in the global carbon cycle. They produce a large proportion of CO2 emissions, but they also sequester and store carbon in urban forests and green space. However, sequestration by urban green space is difficult to quantify and also involves emissions. The carbon footprint analysis is an established method for systematically quantifying carbon sinks and sources throughout the lifetime of goods and services. We applied this method to an urban green space project in Leipzig, Germany. To the best of our knowledge it is the first application in this field. We simulated carbon sequestration by growing trees and contrasted it with all related carbon sources, from construction and maintenance over the lifetime of 50 years. In addition, we explored alternative design and maintenance scenarios. Total net sequestration was predicted to be between 137 and 162 MgCO2 ha−1. Park-like design and maintenance is less effective than forest-like design and maintenance. Much uncertainty is linked to tree growth and tree mortality. Increasing annual tree mortality from 0.5 to 4% reduces sequestration by over 70%. In conclusion, urban green space can act as a carbon sink and the design and maintenance have a strong influence on the carbon footprint. The carbon footprint analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the long- term environmental performance of urban green space projects. Compared to emissions from people, the overall potential for carbon mitigation is limited, even in cities such as Leipzig with widely available space for new urban green space. ©

AB  - Full article: New York, USA, 25th September 2012—Poaching and the illicit trafficking of wildlife products were raised on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time this Monday, during discussions on strengthening national and international governance. World leaders gathering in New York for the global body’s 67th annual meeting highlighted wildlife trafficking along with other severe threats to the rule of law such as corruption and drug running.  In a written statement, permanent Security Council member United States highlighted “the harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts, rule of law, governance and economic development.” The rapidly-growing illicit international trade in endangered species products, such as rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger parts, is now estimated to be worth $5 billion per year globally.   “Such organized crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing,” Gabon’s President Ali Bongo said during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. “Gabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon. But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperation.”   Permanent member France also emphasized the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime. “There are still entire sectors of activity without any legal safety,” French Minister Delegate for Development Pascal Canfin said. “International law is lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural resources, for example, or the trafficking of fauna.”   President Bongo took the occasion to reaffirm his country’s commitment to “combating violations of the Convention on International Trade [in] Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora as well as other conventions to protect the environment and biodiversity.”  In response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa, President Bongo oversaw the burning of Gabon’s seized ivory stockpile earlier this year after a full audit supported by WWF and TRAFFIC. Organized criminal syndicates, sometimes linked to armed insurgent groups, are believed to be behind many of the tens of thousands of elephant poaching deaths occurring in Africa each year. Ivory tusks are highly valuable on Asian black markets.   “Illicit wildlife trafficking can have severe consequences for people as well as the environment, yet it is not considered a serious crime by many governments. It is often a low risk and high profit criminal activity, which is a dangerous combination,” said Wendy Elliott, WWF Global Species Programme Manager. “Governments have made a significant step forward by introducing the issue into this important forum on the rule of law. We now call on all them to increase their law enforcement responses to wildlife crime on a commensurate basis.” Roland Melisch, Director of TRAFFIC’s Africa & Europe programmes said: “Good governance is essential to prevent crimes such as illicit wildlife trafficking. Countries need to be held accountable to their commitments under relevant United Nations treaties.”  WWF and its partner TRAFFIC, the wildlife monitoring network, are campaigning for greater protection of threatened species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants. In order to save endangered animals, source, transit and demand countries must all improve law enforcement, customs controls and judicial systems. WWF and TRAFFIC are also urging governments in consumer countries to undertake demand reduction efforts to curb the use of endangered species products.

AB  - Global tendencies of urban structure changes, resulting from changes in technology and in the economy show first evidence by causing decentralization in the surroundings of big cities (Sassen, 1994). Such changes are taken as a challenge to look for new patterns of urban structure development and for new policies of development guidance in East Germany. The paper acknowledges the differences between east and west German traces of long-term urban structure development. The contribution regards the problems of East-German towns (inner area decline, loss of population, repeated waves of sub-urbanisation under GDR and FRG- governments) as indicators for opportunities in urban structure development. It concentrates on a case of example, a site in the city of Magdeburg, where the property market shows interest despite the fact that the town continues to loose inhabitants since 1990. Being part of the restructuring of an old industrialised area beside an old local core, being located near to the city centre and adjacent to the river Elbe, the site represents equally opportunities for the development of urban structure and of urban space. The urban qualities of the location indicate the opportunity for a new "nucleus" of urban development and promise a contribution to a competitive regional economy (s. Healey, 1993). Therefore, general criteria for qualities of urban development (Bentley e.a.) are referred to as a scale for evaluating existing and new conditions of the usability and the legibility of urban structures. This scale is supposed to represent processes of development which aim to a differentiated system of private and public spaces in a changing system of interconnected hierarchies of urban space. The article comprises - firstly, defining the subject and the questions of investigation, - secondly, introducing the reflection of long term and recent political influences on urban structure and urban space and reminding the major changes in property ownership from 1990, - thirdly, regarding the case of example concerning indications for new patterns of urban development and understandings of co-operation and competition from a practical point of view by evaluating the approach of the community in comparison to a students project, having been supervised by the author, - finally, drawing conclusions from the case about perspectives for guidance through planning gain which may provide new patterns of urban structure, new forms of cooperation and an alternative understanding of competition in the planning and development process.

Together with the conventional variables used to explain housing prices, three environmental variables are considered: the existence of views of a park or a public garden, the distance from the dwelling to its nearest green area and the size of that open space. The sample is made up of 810 observations gathered from the city of Castellón (Spain). Results show housing size to be the most relevant variable on price. As far as the hedonic variables are concerned, there is an inverse relationship between the selling price of the dwelling and its distance from a green urban area. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Commuting cost differences between workers and nonworkers tend to increase unemployment, and competition for land tends to segregate workers and nonworkers, with nonworkers relegated to the urban fringe. These findings are extended to a two-city system, where it is shown that even with free mobility of workers, significant wage and unemployment differentials can exist between cities characterized by different levels of productivity.

AB  - Planners in many urban areas are working to develop systems of greenways -- linear open spaces along natural or artificial corridors, such as riverfronts, streams, ridgelines, abandoned railroad right-of-ways, canals, or scenic roads. Many greenways include trails for active recreasonal use, including walking, running, bicycling, and skating. Previous studies of greenways have classified local trails as those with the majority of users living within five miles of the trail. These studies suggest that levels of trail use depend on location and trail characteristics, but specific factors that determine variations in patterns of use are not well understood. This paper reports the results of counts and surveys of users on three linked greenway trails in Indianapolis, IN. Methods for counting and surveying users are described. It is shown that use of trails is significant, but that intensity and patterns of use vary considerably by trail segment. Results are compared with the findings of previous studies, and the need to refine definitions of local trails to account for trails that serve primarily neighborhoods is noted. Differentiation among local trails, trail segments in neighborhoods, and trail activity type is necessary to design market segmentation strategies for trail development.

In particular, civil and defense applications often require and employ detailed models of operations areas for training, simulations of different scenarios, planning for natural or man-made events, monitoring, surveillance, games, and films. A realistic representation of the large-scale environments is therefore imperative for the success of such applications since it increases the immersive experience of its users and helps reduce the difference between physical and virtual reality. However, the task of creating such large-scale virtual environments still remains a time-consuming and manual work. In this work, we propose a novel method for the rapid reconstruction of photorealistic large-scale virtual environments. First, a novel, extendible, parameterized geometric primitive is presented for the automatic building identification and reconstruction of building structures. In addition, buildings with complex roofs containing complex linear and nonlinear surfaces are reconstructed interactively using a linear polygonal and a nonlinear primitive, respectively. Second, we present a rendering pipeline for the composition of photorealistic textures, which unlike existing techniques, can recover missing or occluded texture information by integrating multiple information captured from different optical sensors (ground, aerial, and satellite).

AB  - This paper examines the impacts of different types of urban containment policies (UCPs) on the spatial structure of US metropolitan areas, with a particular focus on UCP tightness. These UCPs include state-mandated urban growth boundaries (UGBs), locally adopted urban growth boundaries and urban service areas (USAs). Population and employment density gradients, taken as concentration measures, are estimated for 135 metropolitan areas and are then used in a simultaneous equation model to assess the impacts of different UCPs on metropolitan spatial structure. The results suggest that state-mandated 'strong' UGBs more effectively promote growth within the boundaries than locally adopted UGBs or USAs.

AB  - The urban growth pattern and its influential factors in Shenyang from 1988 to 2004 are analyzed and simulated by combing remote sensing, GIS, and spatial logistic regression method. These results show that the major determinants are the construction of economic development zones, the transfer of administrative system, the distribution of urban centers and transportation, Hun river and urban planning. The spatial model for urban growth has a credible precision with high ROC value (0.960), and the simulation performance of the model for location is better than that for quantity of urban development. These results will support government decisions on urban growth management and sustainable development in Shenyang.

AB  - Increasing the use of urban green space has appeared on the political agenda, primarily because increased use is expected to improve the health and well-being of the urban population. Green space is contributing to restoring mental fatigue, serving as a resource for physical activity, reducing mortality and reducing the level of stress. However, knowledge and experience on how to implement this agenda are scarce. In this paper, we use a socio-ecological model as framework when studying influences on the use of respondents’ nearest urban green space in the Danish city of Odense. Data were obtained from a survey sent to 2500 randomly selected adult residents within the central part of the city. We tested the relative importance of different factors on the frequency of use of the nearest urban green space by using a multivariate logistic regression model. The results show that almost half of the respondents did not use their nearest green space the most. Whether or not respondent used their nearest green space most depends primarily on area size, distance to the area and factors that are likely to express a reduced mobility; old age, young children and poor health. If the nearest urban green space also is the most used green space, having a dog is the only factor that significantly increases the frequency of use. Further research is needed to determine what it is that makes people use an area more, if the basic conditions of a reasonable size (>5 ha) within a reasonable distance (<600 m) are fulfilled.

AB  - La Rochelle, France witnessed an important growth of its permanent and seasonal population during the second half of the twentieth century. Its attractive coastal position is the main reason for this increase, which led to a massive urban spread, particularly in La Rochelle peripheral municipalities. Which are the strategies used by local public authorities to take into account social and environmental problems? While it has been very innovative since 1970 in regard to urban ecology and sustainable development, does La Rochelle still have today the capacity to tend towards the "ideal sustainable city"? On the contrary, is La Rochelle powerless, or even more complicit in the urban sprawl phenomenon? The purpose of this paper is to focus on one factor that particularly influences urban growth: local urban policies and planning strategies through planning documents analysis. For this, an urban growth model based on a cellular automata paradigm is used. In this model, the space is described as a grid, for each non built cell, with a graduated probability of building. This probability of building is based on the analysis of planning rules (e.g. urban planning regulation framework). The example of the correlation between these planning rules and local urban growth is described in this paper. The model enables the simulation of alternative urban growth scenarios. It helps one to estimate how alternative planning could affect non built areas. This model aims at helping the elaboration of future planning documents. The control of La Rochelle's urban spread is one of the main stakes to be taken into account in the future land development plan (Schema de COherence Territoriale: SCOT). The SCOT is currently being elaborated in La Rochelle. © 2010 WIT Press.

AB  - From the mid nineteenth century, the City of Dessau (Germany) developed as an economic centre. The development of new residential and industrial areas changed the natural landscape having an adverse impact on the surface water, soil water and groundwater regimes. Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - Urban evolution model is an assistant analysis method for urban planning which can effectively trace the urban development process of the past and predict the possible evolution scenarios in the future. This paper proposed urban spatial system dynamic model (USSD model) by coupling strategy between Geographic Information System (GIS) and urban System Dynamic (SD). GIS can deal with the static spatial relationships while SD can deal with the dynamic relationships of complex spatial system. This new urban expansion model can predict the expansion scenarios in the future according to tracing the urban development of the past. It considered the spatial relationships among urban system elements as well as the dynamic links and interactions among the spatial elements over time. It is achieved through a dynamic data exchange between GIS and SD. Firstly we analyzed urban system by using five subsystems: population, resources, transportation, land usage and soil erosion. Secondly, we have developed USSD model based on dynamic links among the subsystems. Thirdly, we have created five layers in GIS and operated them in the USSD model. Finally, a case study illustrated the USSD model in Wuhan city. It is concluded that the USSD model is an efficient tool for forecasting the urban expansion with its advantages on dealing with the spatio-temporal problem. © 2008 SPIE.

In this paper, we present an integrated system dynamics and cellular automata model not only in socio-economic driving forces analysis but also in urban spatial pattern evaluation. Shanghai city in China is selected as a case to fulfill the tasks. The major findings are summarized as follows: (1) the integrated model is proved to be competent in monitoring and projecting the dynamics of urban growth. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the urban area of Shanghai is predicted to increase at an annual rate of 3%, and amount 1474 km

Road network planning plays an important role in directing the development of newly urbanized land. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Algarve region in Portugal is often considered as one of the most appealing regions for tourism in the country. Its attractive location and moderate climate have since the mid-1960s brought increasing economic prosperity. As a result of the development of mass tourism, available land-use resources were widely exploited to create an integrated tourist industry. In this area, economic prosperity has led to an increasing population and a significant growth of infrastructures to cope with the demand from the hospitality sector. The far-reaching land-use changes have, however, led to high pressures on the coastal areas of the Algarve. This region has shown an increasing loss of ecosystems resulting from the expansion of urban areas. This paper proposes a dynamic assessment of urban growth in the Algarve based on non-linear complex system modelling by using cellular automata converging on qualitative story lines with quantitative spatial methodologies. This new methodology utilizes both quantitative and qualitative spatial results by a comparative validation of built scenarios, in order to highlight future land use trends. In particular, three scenarios will be explored, each with distinct specific socio-economic paths. Our analysis to identify the scenario with the best fit, based on the evolution of the actual 2006 land cover, enabled us to build a future urban growth model for 2020 which was quantitatively assessed. The outcome suggests a picture of continuing growth for the region of the Algarve within the framework of current policies and regressive spatial trends. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease globally and is usually associated with built environments in tropical areas. Remotely sensed information can facilitate the study of urban mosquito-borne diseases by providing multiple temporal and spatial resolutions appropriate to investigate urban structure and ecological characteristics associated with infectious disease. In this study, coarse, medium and fine resolution satellite imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and QuickBird respectively) and ground-based data were analyzed for the Greater Puntarenas area, Costa Rica for the years 2002-04. The results showed that the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generally higher in the localities with lower incidence of dengue fever during 2002, although the correlation was statistically significant only in the dry season (r = -0.40; p = 0.03). Dengue incidence was inversely correlated to built area and directly correlated with tree cover (r = 0.75, p = 0.01). Overall, the significant correlations between dengue incidence and urban structural variables (tree cover and building density) suggest that properties of urban structure may be associated with dengue incidence in tropical urban settings.

This paper provides evidence for the US suggesting that the resurgence of big cities in the 1990s is due, in part, to the increased demand for these interactions and due to the reduction in big city crime, which had made it difficult for urban residents to enjoy these social amenities. However, while density is correlated with consumer amenities, we show that it is not correlated with social capital and that there is no evidence that sprawl has hurt civic engagement.

AB  - In this paper we consider urban spatial structure in US cities using a multidimensional approach. We select six key variables (commuting costs, density, employment dispersion and concentration, land-use mix, polycentricity, and size) from the urban literature and define measures to quantify them. We then apply these measures to 359 metropolitan areas from the 2000 US Census. The adopted methodological strategy combines two novel techniques for the social sciences to explore the existence of relevant patterns in such multidimensional datasets. Geodesic self-organizing maps (SOM) are used to visualize the whole set of information in a meaningful way, while the recently developed clustering algorithm of the max-p is applied to draw boundaries within the SOM and analyze which cities fall into each of them.

AB  - This paper is addressed to the problem of developing realistic-looking patterns of land use and activity from predictions generated by conventional urban models. The method developed is based on a geometric model of irregularity involving hierarchical cascading and recursion, whose rationale lies in the emergent field of fractal geometry. First the idea of fractans - shapes with fractional dimension - is introduced and then it is shown how two-dimensional patterns whose dimensions are consistent with a large city such as London can be simulated at different levels of detail or recursion. It is then argued that the hierarchical structure of cities should be exploited as a basis for such simulation, and it is argued that discrete choice models of individual spatial behaviour have excellent properties which enable their embedding into such simulations. The standard multinomial logit model is presented and then applied to house-type data in Greater London. A variety of models are estimated, house-type choice being related to age and distance from the centre of the city, and the spatial biases in these predictions are then mapped using prediction success statistics. These models are then used at the base level of a fractal simulation of house type and location in London. Random and deterministic model simulations are developed, and an unusual and possibly innovative feature of these simulations involves the way the inputs and outputs, data and predictions, are simultaneously displayed on the graphics device used. Conclusions for further research, particularly in spatial hierarchical modelling, are then sketched.

AB  - Based on the theories of the information entropy of urban land use structure, co-integration and error correction model, this thesis analyses the relationship between economic growth, urbanization level and the information entropy of urban land use structure. The information entropy values of China's urban land use structure from 1981 to 2004 have been calculated in this paper. The relationship between China's GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is investigated in details. The results indicate a co-integration relationship between GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure. However, there is no co-integration relationship between urbanization and the information entropy of urban land use structure. On the basis of the above analyses, the error correction model on GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is instituted. The application of the model shows that every 1% decrease in the information entropy value of urban land use structure demands a 59.53% growth in GDP. Because of the existing co-integration relationship between the economic growth and the information entropy of urban land use structure, the order degree of China's urban land use structure has relied heavily on the economic growth for a long time. The economic growth will significantly affect the optimal regulation of urban land use structure in the future. Further investigation also shows that economic growth and urbanization act as the direct driving force of the optimization of urban land use structure, but the optimization of urban land use structure can't promote the economic growth and the urbanization. Therefore, it becomes a very pressing strategic issue to adjust the economic structure and industrial distribution to optimize the distribution of urban land use and to optimize the structure of urban land use to improve the efficiency and promote the socio-economic development.

AB  - Debates on the urban form have become strongly polarized between the advocates and opponents of the compact and of the dispersed or “sprawled” city. In this paper we argue that this may be the result of an excessive concentration on the study of the American experience and the neglect of other urban contexts, and examine the recent process of urban growth against the background of urban compactness and extreme densification represented by the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). The comparison of two detailed land-cover maps of 1993 and 2000 shows a progressive transformation in the traditional urban character of the region. Lower urban densities, high losses of non-urban land covers, depopulation of the metropolitan inner core, an increasing importance of single housing or the expansion of transportation infrastructures confirm the generalization of the dispersed urban model. However, the presence of numerous medium sized towns has also proved to be a deterrent of excessive dispersion. In conclusion, polycentric metropolitan areas such as the BMR may be more adjusted to absorb the negative effects of dispersion than monocentric areas.

AB  - Cities around the world have marked differences in spatial form and structure. To some extent this can be attributed to cultural differences. However, the impact spatial form has on the interactions within and between residents of different neighbourhoods is unclear. This paper calls on empirical evidence collected in the Walled City of Ahmedabad, India, home to Hindu and Muslim residents in distinct neighbourhoods for centuries. Employing Space Syntax method, this paper reveals significant differences in how public spaces are spatially laid out by these two communities. Muslim neighbourhoods have a spatial structure typical of a naturally evolved settlement, where the most integrated spaces are clustered centrally. In contrast, Hindu neighbourhoods have an 'inside-out' pattern, with the most integrated spaces located at the neighbourhood edge. The cultural significance of these distinct forms is discussed alongside the relationship between the neighbourhoods and the rest of the city. These findings on spatial structure could have an important role in Ahmedabad's urban planning. A better understanding of how public space relates to lifestyle and culture could contribute to improved community relations. It could also contribute to dealing successfully with communal conflict, economic development, social sustainability as part of Ahmedabad's future urban planning strategies. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper analyses trends in evolution of the urban spatial structure (or urban form) of the city of Ahmedabad, with two key objectives in mind: to generate a quantitative understanding of the evolution of the spatial structure and use such a quantitative understanding to inform the formulation of alternative planning policies for the future. Time-series population data from the Census of India over three decades have been used, which are usually available in most developing countries. In the case of Ahmedabad, the city exhibits a gradual tendency of dispersal, although compared with some other mid-sized metropolitan areas of the world, it is relatively compact. A discussion on the application of the spatial structure analysis to the formulation of alternative planning policies is included. Such analyses for similar cities in India and the developing world in general could be carried out to produce a useful catalogue of cities. However, this is not the objective of the paper, but in due course such literature could be built up.

AB  - This paper examines the viability of some basic predictions of the Mills-Muth model of city structure for modern cities using US data for the year 2000. The estimation strategy used to test the predictions is very similar to that of Jan Brueckner and David Fansler, who use 1970 data to find support for the model's basic comparative statics predictions-namely, that city area is increasing in population and income but decreasing in agricultural land value and commuting costs. This paper uses different measures for land values and commuting costs where possible and a measure of polycentricity to estimate a slightly modified empirical model. Despite the changing structure of cities, there is evidence that the Mills-Muth comparative statics predictions hold for modern US cities, that densely populated cities are more likely to have sub-centres and that market forces drive urban spatial structure.

AB  - The availability of urban green space (UGS) is one of the environmental factors that is frequently linked to increased levels of physical activity (PA). Positive associations with increased levels of PA are reported for the amount of UGS close to home, the distance to the nearest UGS, the size of the nearest UGS, and the presence of certain features. However, the evidence to date is somewhat inconclusive, and dominated by studies from North America and Australia. There is a large variation in city structures, and recommendations for North American or Australian cities are not automatically valid for European cities. Using a sample of 1305 Danish adults and detailed descriptions of UGS, we examined the association between UGS and outdoor PA in general, as well as PA in the nearest UGS. No association between outdoor PA in general, size of, distance to, and number of features in the nearest UGS was found. The amount and number of UGS within 1km revealed no association either. For PA in the nearest UGS positive associations with size, walking/cycling routes, wooded areas, water features, lights, pleasant views, bike rack, and parking lot were found. This indicates that PA in a UGS might be stimulated by providing these features there. However, interventions or longitudinal studies are needed to explore potential causal relationship.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - Two basic assumptions are made: (1) that urban population density declines exponentially with distance from the center of the city; and (2) that the density gradient itself declines through time. From these, two propositions are deduced: (1) the rule of intraurban allometric growth, which states that the rate of growth is a positive exponential function of distance from the center of the city; and (2) the density-growth rate rule, which states that intraurban residential population densities at the beginning of a given period, and the associated rates of population change prevailing during that period, are related by an inverse power function. Two equations for estimating the total population within a city or urban region are presented, the first employing the density parameters in conjunction with the radius and the second employing the density parameters in conjunction with the perimeter density. Data presented within this mathematical framework demonstrate (1) that the urban region (SMA) has a perimeter density of about 2000 persons per square mile and (2) that there is a critical intraurban density (found, in the two cases cited, to be about 30,000 per square mile) which, if exceeded, will eventually be associated with population decrease in the areas concerned. Such areas are the central business district or localities where pathological social conditions are either incipient or already evident.

AB  - This paper expands empirical testing of the predictions of the standard monocentric urban model to examine the size of urban spatial expansion for all US metropolitan regions for the years 1980, 1990 and 2000. Until recently, the lack of temporally and spatially-consistently interpreted data on urban extent for U.S. metropolitan areas has limited the ability to estimate panel models of land use change. This paper first describes the creation of a consistent data set on urbanized land area for all U.S. metropolitan areas. It then estimates cross-sectional models of the determinants of urban spatial extent. For purposes of comparison, results are compared to temporally-consistent satellite-derived measures of developed land area from the National Land Cover Database. The paper then presents panel-model estimates of changes in urban land area, finding that both population and income elasticities are substantially less than unity. Tests for the structural stability of urbanized land area determinants across metropolitan size categories and polycentric regions are presented. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The paper derives equilibrium prices for a racist city and demonstrates that the city is less dense at the core, more dense in the suburbs, and covers a larger area than an unprejudiced city. A more complex theory of housing supply is then developed, and it is shown that racism's impact on the ghetto depends upon the ease with which maintenance can be reduced, the cost of replacing abandoned housing, and the nature of legal controls on housing quality.

AB  - Urban expansion as a dynamic process of land use change is a complicated social/economic phenomenon. It may be linked with details related to topography, transportation, land use, social structure and economic type, but it is generally related to demography and economy in a city. It is helpful for macro-planning and decision-making to have a simulation model available which considers these two factors. Since the spatial appearance of urban expansion is similar in some degree with a physical diffusion process, one easy way to model urban expansion under various scenarios is to build a simulation model based on basic diffusion. In this way, a clear mechanism of urban expansion is demonstrated. Population density is regarded as an internal driving factor and economy as an external push on urban expansion. Because of its computational features, this model is implemented with cellular automata. These have an advantage in that they allow the model to be extended and to be incorporated with other geographical systems. By applying the model to an actual example for scenario studies, we have shown that it can produce some valuable results through simulations at various scenarios. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Increasing transportation cost will decrease the urban radius, population density and land rent for all locations except the CBD in an open city. But in the closed city land rent and population density increase in the CBD and decrease at the urban margins. Household response to changes in transportation cost depends upon the spatial location of households. The real price of gasoline has not increased greatly, and nominally high gasoline prices alone do not necessarily contribute to urban core revitalization.-from Author

AB  - Urban green space plays an important role in enhancing the quality of environment especially for urban biodiversity. Declining biodiversity around the world has received much attention among academics, professionals and citizens. The United Nations has declared year 2010 as the ‘International Year of Biodiversity’. Urban biodiversity movement is important to ensure healthy city environments. Despite this ongoing movement, urban dwellers have little knowledge about conservation of biodiversity particularly wildlife. Moreover, biodiversity has received little attention from built environment practices (Brown & Grant, 2005; Niemelä, 1999). In general, urban wildlife habitat is protected as reserved forest. Many species of wildlife are generally found in such reserved forests. In comparison, the scale of urban parks in Kuala Lumpur is massive, much larger than protected forests. This paper presents the situation of urban wildlife species and the quality of habitats in Kuala Lumpur. It is found that many factors contribute to the healthy conservation of urban wildlife such as quality and variety of habitats, ornamental versus native vegetation and ecological design. The findings highlight that common urban birds are dominant in urban green spaces regardless of the size of the green spaces. However, only larger urban green spaces help protect species. Finally, the study concludes that urban wildlife in Kuala Lumpur is rapidly declining and that there is a greater need for the community and stakeholders to promote programs and activities to preserve and enhance urban wildlife. Development of comprehensive acts, policies and guidelines are vital for urban wildlife protection.

AB  - By integrating environmental traffic capacity (ETC) with traffic structure optimization (TSO) on urban road, influencing factors of ETC were analyzed, and the concept of TSO was introduced. Based on functional relationship between emission factors and vehicular speed, and the regression model of vehicular speed and traffic volume, a relation between traffic volume and traffic pollutants diffusion concentration was set up. A multi-objective optimization model, whose objectives were the maximum of traffic volume and traffic efficiency, was developed and its main constraints were the traffic capacity and the control concentration of pollutants in air quality standard, and then its solving algorithm was designed. The practical example study shows that there are different ETC values according to different environment air quality evaluation factors and the reasonable traffic structure is not only beneficial to improving road traffic efficiency, and also favorable to protecting environment air quality.

AB  - This paper focuses on the way urban dynamic processes challenge existing monitoring approaches and how Urban Structure Types (UST) support an effective urban management. Due to their microstructure and the instability of shape, the differentiation of settlement structures is substantially difficult. Hence, highly sophisticated data such as color infrared (CIR) ortho-photos as well as methods of image analysis, e.g. segmentation of objects will be employed. It will be shown how an object-oriented analysis strategy with CIR aerial photographs can be used to detect and discriminate different urban structure types by describing typical characteristics of color, texture, shape and context. The urban structure classification is characterized by identifying different types of buildings (different types of housing, industrial buildings, infrastructure) and open spaces (woodland, allotments, parks), their structural composition in terms of the amount, connectivity, and distribution of impervious surfaces, green spaces, and other open spaces on an aggregated neighborhood scale. This paper contributes to a transferable methodology to monitor the urban dynamics and structure on a local level.

AB  - Urban green spaces have important amenity values that include provision of leisure opportunities and aesthetic enjoyment. However, most of these values lack a market price. Consequently, they are usually ignored or underestimated by urban planning policy-makers, with the result that remnant urban green spaces are being gradually encroached upon by urban sprawl. As a result, quantitative information regarding the implicit, non-market price benefits from urban green space is urgently required. Properties bought and sold on the market are compound commodities that embody amenity values and people are willing to pay to live in the proximity of local amenity environment. Thus hedonic models, which use such properties as proxies, can often be employed to quantify environmental amenities. In China, residential housing reform (in place since 1998) has terminated the traditional residential welfare system, and made it possible to quantify the monetary value of green space amenities based on hedonic pricing models. This study was conducted in Jinan City, and will help address the previous absence of the application of hedonic price models to the valuation of urban green space amenities in mainland China. GIS and landscape metrics were used in determining hedonic price model variables. As expected, the results proved that the hedonic pricing model performed well using this approach, and accordingly it was further improved. Results also confirmed the positive amenity impact of proximate urban green spaces on house prices, and highlighted the preferences of homeowners in Jinan City. Green space amenity variables that were statistically significant at the 5% level included the size-distance index of scenery forest, accessibility to park and plaza green space types, and the percentage of urban green space. In addition, land-use patch richness, the location sector and the education environment also proved to be highly significant variables. The results of the study should provide insights to policy-makers involved in urban planning. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban environments contain habitats for flowering plants and their pollinating animal species. It is, however, unclear how the urban matrix influences plant-pollinator processes. We recorded plant diversity, floral abundance, flower visitor diversity and plot visits at 89 plant patches within the city of Zürich. The urban matrix surrounding each site was analyzed for the landscape metrics edge density and the extent of green area up to 200 m radius. The correlation between edge density and bee diversity and visitation frequency varied over the entire spatial range, while the correlation for syrphid diversity and visitation frequency levelled off at 80 m radius. In contrast, the correlations with green area were more consistent, with bee diversity levelling off after 100 m, while syrphid diversity and visits continued to increase. The variation in the correlation of bee visits was partly accounted for by the large contribution of honeybees. Plant diversity significantly affected bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits. Floral abundance had a positive effect on bee visits and bee diversity. Syrphid diversity had a negative interaction with floral abundance and green area. The extent of green area increased bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits, while edge density reduced visitation by bees. This study showed that plant diversity and floral abundance in urban environments promote pollinating flower visitors. The extent of green area and edge density are important urban mosaic attributes that affect pollinator abundance and visitation frequency at multiple scales.

AB  - Cities, as complex systems, present different urban patterns and spatial dynamics with diverse and multiple characteristics. Urban systems change and reorganise according to the diverse outcomes of economic globalisation, based primarily on population data, but with secondary reference to trends in economic growth and restructuring, and to the various roles played by governments in shaping the urbanisation process (Bourne 1995). Thus, economic growth and restructuring resulting from globalisation creates certain population dynamics and mobility patterns that influence the reorganisation of urban spaces (drivers of the economic globalisation are discussed in detail in Chap. 5 for the case study areas introduced in this book). The reorganisation of urban space, which is strongly influenced by the adaptation strategies of cities to global processes and endogenous capacities, takes various forms. This chapter intends to explore these spatial forms and dynamics and their implications on the resilience of cities. It is argued in Chap. 1 that certain spatial patterns may provide capacity to the system to absorb disturbances and reorganise itself. In this chapter, in order to understand the extent of the spatial dynamics to address social and spatial challenges, both the inner city and peri-urbanised areas, first of all, these spatial dynamics are identified, and secondly, their relation to the attributes of resilience is clarified. In this respect this chapter aims to provide an umbrella conceptual framework for the relationship between spatial change and resilience.

AB  - Research indicates a relationship between sensory perception of natural environments and human health. Our hypothesis is that people perceive green spaces in terms of certain dimensions, where some dimensions are more important and preferred than others with respect to restoring people from stress. The aims are to: identify and describe the perceived dimensions in nature; identify which dimensions people in general prefer; identify the dimensions people reporting stress prefer; and identify a combination of the dimensions people reporting stress prefer. A total of 953 randomly selected informants from nine Swedish cities (representative of the Swedish population) answered a postal questionnaire with pre-coded questions. The questionnaire consisted of three parts: personal data, preferences for natural qualities and self-estimations of health status. The data were analyzed using factor analysis and regression analyses. The results identify and describe eight perceived sensory dimensions. People in general prefer the dimension Serene, followed by Space, Nature, Rich in Species, Refuge, Culture, Prospect and Social. The dimensions Refuge and Nature are most strongly correlated with stress, indicating a need to find the most restorative environments. A combination of Refuge, Nature and Rich in Species, and a low or no presence of Social, could be interpreted as the most restorative environment for stressed individuals. From a city planning perspective, the results indicate how urban green spaces can be viewed as elements of importance to public mental health. However, before the dimensions can be used by practitioners as tools to promote health through city planning, more research is needed. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The use of CA in urban expansion modeling is well known since many years, but very rarely it has been related with a down-top approach which considers inhabitants' preferences as a driving tool to characterize the CA algorithm. In addition, we consider as a control mechanism of the cell conversion rate (i.e. the number of cells experiencing conversion into urban use) the logistic function. This function is tuned on the free space (cells) at disposal for the urban development.

AB  - Urban structure types (UST) are an initial interest and basic instrument for monitoring, controlling and modeling tasks of urban planners and decision makers during ongoing urbanization processes. This study focuses on a method to classify UST from land cover (LC) objects, which were derived from high resolution satellite images. The topology of urban LC objects is analyzed by implementing neighborhood LC-graphs. Various graph measures are examined by their potential to distinguish between different UST, using the machine learning classifier random forest. Additionally the influence of different parameter settings of the random forest model, the reduction of training samples, and the graph measure importance is analyzed. An independent test set is classified and validated, achieving an overall accuracy of 87%. It was found that the height of the building with the highest node degree has a strong impact on the classification result.

AB  - The primary concerns in this study were to quantify the connectivity and green space pattern using landscape metrics (PLAND, NP, AREA_MN and CONNECT) in the central districts of the city of Izmir. The primary research materials included thirteen 1:25,000 scale standard topographical maps and IKONOS satellite image with 1 m resolution. The PLAND scores revealed that while the urban fabric occupied almost 26 % of the study area, the urban green spaces covered only 1.45 %. This was also the lowest score in proportion to the areas of other land-use/cover classes. Furthermore, the results of NP and MPS indicated that the configuration of urban green spaces was very patchy and highly fragmented. Likewise, using CONNECT, the overall connectivity score of urban green spaces was 0.12, which was the lowest score of all areas measured the metrics. The Guzelbah double dagger e district seemed to hold the most promise for connectivity, with a CONNECT score of 3.75. On the other hand, the Bornova district presented the least promising case in terms of connectivity, with a score of 0.59. In the study area, the correlations between the size of the districts/built-up areas and the CONNECT scores of the urban green spaces were found to be "non-significant" (P < 0.01). The ultimate goals were to increase the amount of systematically planned urban green spaces and set up a green infrastructure in Izmir. In the case of Izmir, a master planning approach, which uses a systematic and comprehensive method to guide urban green spaces, is necessary to develop planning and design strategies for fully functional and multi-purpose urban green space systems.

AB  - Urban land structure, layout, and land-use mode influence regional sustainable development greatly. However, planners usually cannot work perfectly because of insufficient environmental information for decision making. In recent years, with urban geographic information system (GIS) development many cities have already built up integrated urban information platform to support regional digitalization process. By using spatial data mining technology urban planning related knowledge can be discovered form GIS database to help planners and decision makers in their work. Through analyzing of Chinese cities' construction mode and developing trend, this paper illustrates how to build up an urban planning spatial decision support system (UPSDSS) based on exploratory spatial data analysis technology support. By spatial data mining form GIS database, UPSDSS can provide related knowledge for urban planning decision making with inference engines (rule inference and case inference) support. As an important part of the research, UPSDSS had been used in urban planning management of Harbin city in China. With hidden information discovered by UPSDSS Harbin planners work easily and effectively. Three cases demonstrate how UPSDSS helped Harbin city in policy making in macroscopic urban expending planning, underground exploitation scheme making, and local land structure changing. © 2010 ASCE.

AB  - Studies of the city traditionally posit a division between a citys economy and its culture, with culture subordinate in explanatory power to work. However, postindustrial and globalizing trends are dramatically elevating the importance of culture. Cultural activities are increasingly crucial to urban economic vitality. Models to explain the growth of cities from the era of industrial manufacturing are outmoded. Citizens in the postindustrial city increasingly make quality of life demands, treating their own urban location as if tourists, emphasizing aesthetic concerns. These practices impact considerations about the proper nature of amenities that postindustrial cities can sustain. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR

AB  - With the quick development of urbanization, urban expansion has been paid more and more attention to by researchers from western countries and China. Here Wuxi City of China is selected as a case study. Located in the core-area of Changjiang (Yangtze) River Delta, as the sources of Chinese township enterprise, Wu culture, and national industry, Wuxi has experienced great change in the urban spatial structure, especially in the land use struc- ture, and urban shape and scale. The ratio of industrial land was about one-third of the construction land in 2003. Residential and public infrastructure land had decreased a little from 1956 to 2003, but it remains to be the main con- struction land at present. Green land has increased at the highest speed due to the demand of sustainable develop- ment. After the reform and opening to the outside world, this kind of evolvement of urban spatial expansion is help- ful for sustainable development. Economic development, transportation, and administrative planning are the main reasons for these changes. During different periods, the main drives are different. Economic development is the basic factor that influences urban expansion. Transportation influences urban evolvement in different times, but now the importance is not as great as 30 years ago, because administrative force plays an important function in urban plan- ning of China and influences urban evolvemen

AB  - The phenomenon of Urban Heat Island is shown by an increase in temperature that mostly affects urban areas in comparison with the surrounding rural areas. This increase in temperature becomes problematic during the heat waves when it can give rise to problems of energy and health. The factors affecting this phenomenon are related to the morphology and location of the urban area, to the characteristics of building and roads materials, to the shape of urban structure. The paper investigates the phenomenon of UHI by analyzing in particular the influence of major urban planning features: the average height of buildings, the building density, the coverage ratio, the percentage of impermeable surface. The study was carried out starting from the analysis of a real case within the Province of Naples. The identification of areas liable to heat islands has been done by working out a thermal map of the Province of Naples through the creation of hyper-spectral satellite images using remote sensing techniques. This map has allowed to select some sample areas within which the main urban planning parameters have been detected through remote sensing techniques or spatial analysis. For each parameter, correlation curves "temperature - urban planning parameter" have been worked out. The main result is the development of an abacus that allows to estimate the expected temperature changes according to the decrease or increase of each urban parameter. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

We demonstrate that open space policies should not be viewed as independent of-or necessarily compatible with-growth management goals. We examine the impacts of open space designation on the urban landscape in a spatial city model with two important and empirically relevant features; (1) residents prefer to live close to open space and (2) open space amenities attract migrants to the city. Our main findings are that open space designation can produce leapfrog development; the effect of open space on the total area of developed land in the city is ambiguous; more dispersed forms of open space may be preferred when congestion externalities are present; depending on location, the provision of new open space may benefit some income groups more than others and may increase the income diversity of a city.

AB  - This study applied logistic regression to model urban growth in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area of Georgia in a GIS environment and to discover the relationship between urban growth and the driving forces. Historical land use/cover data of Atlanta were extracted from the 1987 and 1997 Landsat TM images. Multi-resolution calibration of a series of logistic regression models was conducted from 50 m to 300 m at intervals of 25 m. A fractal analysis pointed to 225 m as the optimal resolution of modeling. The following two groups of factors were found to affect urban growth in different degrees as indicated by odd ratios: (1) population density, distances to nearest urban clusters, activity centers and roads, and high/low density urban uses (all with odds ratios < 1); and (2) distance to the CBD, number of urban cells within a 7 ?? 7 cell window, bare land, crop/grass land, forest, and UTM northing coordinate (all with odds ratios > 1). A map of urban growth probability was calculated and used to predict future urban patterns. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.85 indicates that the probability map is valid. It was concluded that despite logistic regression's lack of temporal dynamics, it was spatially explicit and suitable for multi-scale analysis, and most importantly, allowed much deeper understanding of the forces driving the growth and the formation of the urban spatial pattern. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Irtually all of the growth in the worlds population for the foreseeable future will take place in the cities and towns of the developing world. Over the next twenty years, most developing countries will for the first time become more urban than rural. The benefits from urbanization cannot be overlooked, but the speed and sheer scale of this transformation present many challenges. A new cast of policy makers is emerging to take up the many responsibilities of urban governanceas many national governments decentralize and devolve their functions, programs in poverty, health, education, and public services are increasingly being deposited in the hands of untested municipal and regional governments. Demographers have been surprisingly slow to devote attention to the implications of the urban transformation. Drawing from a wide variety of data sources, many of them previously inaccessible, Cities Transformed explores the implications of various urban contexts for marriage, fertility, health, schooling, and childrens lives. It should be of interest to all involved in city-level research, policy, planning, and investment decisions.

AB  - In this paper, an analysis is made of the evolution of Spanish urban structure during the period 1900-99. It is postulated that the size distribution of the cities follows a Pareto distribution, which is estimated on a yearly basis. At the same time, the hypothesis is adopted that the intradistribution dynamics can be modelled by means of a Markov chain. In this way, are deduced the so-called transition matrix and its associated vector or ergodic probabilities. This methodology allows two main results to be obtained. First, this evolution has not been homogeneous ; there has been a divergent pattern of growth during the period 1900-70; and a convergent pattern for the period 1970-99. Secondly, the intradistribution movements in the Spanish urban hierarchy have been very significant during the course of the 20th century. In addition, the existence of spatial correlation has also been detected for those cities that have either entered or exited from the sample of the 100 largest cities during the course of the century. 10.1080/0042098032000053923

We study the impact of heterogeneity in tastes on urban structure using the simplest meaningful clone of the standard model: all arguments are presented in the context of a metropolitan area which is partitioned in two homogeneous zones, centre and suburd. Given that individuals have perfect knowledge, heterogeneity in tastes may affect equilibrium in two ways. Namely, individuals may differ with respect to their location decision and, at a particular location, they may differ with respect to how they allocate their initial resources. The strategy adopted here is to study these two effects in isolation.

AB  - Shenyang and Fushun are two most nearest mega cities in China. Integration of the two cities as one sub-administrative economic region is a state and province policy to promote economy development of Liaoning province. How the urban patterns of the mega cities will grow is interested to city planners, decision-makers, land managers, ecologists, geographers, and resource managers because it's special policy and spatiotemporal dynamic complexity. This study explore the combined application of remote sensing, geographical information system and SLEUTH urban growth model to analyze and model urban growth pattern in Shenyang-Fushun metropolitan area northeastern China. The sequential RS images can give quantitative descriptors of the geometry of urban form to be computed and compared over time. The investigation is based on a 16-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical TM satellite imagery. The SLEUTH model was calibrated using the mutil-temporal data set for the 6391.12km<sup>2</sup> area where has experienced rapid urbanization in recent years. The model allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth, and future growth was projected out to 2050 assuming four different policy scenarios: (1) current trends (CT), (2) accelerated urban development (AUD), (3) protected urban development (PUD), and (4) limitative urban growth (LUD). The predicted urban growth shows similar compact pattern under each scenario except the current trends scenario that shows diffused urban growth pattern and most diffused growth appears at south of region. Edge growth and road gravity growth are the main growth types in the future. The accelerated urban development scenario shows the most urban growth area. The limitative urban growth scenario shows the least urban growth area. The protected urban development scenario shows moderate urban growth area and good protection to other land resources. The urban land of two mega cities will connect firstly to a whole on the south bank -
of Hun River about in 2040 in the accelerated urban development and the current trends scenarios, and will not connect on the other two scenarios until 2050. The combined method using remote sensing, geographical information system and SLEUTH urban growth model is powerful for representation, modeling and prediction of the spatiotemporal urban growth, and useful for understanding the alternative future planning scenarios, but location accuracy and scenarios design must be further considered for local application.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field “science of complexity” has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Today’s self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic “patterns”. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially “enslaves” its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the “higher” level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the “lower” levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

AB  - The SLEUTH model (slope, landuse, exclusion, urban extent, transportation and hillshade), formerly called the Clarke Cellular Automaton Urban Growth Model, was developed for and tested on various cities in North America, including Washington, DC, and San Francisco. In contrast, this research calibrated the SLEUTH model for two European cities, the Portuguese metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto. The SLEUTH model is a cellular automaton model, developed with predefined growth rules applied spatially to gridded maps of the cities in a set of nested loops, and was designed to be both scaleable and universally applicable. Urban expansion is modeled in a modified two-dimensional regular grid. Maps of topographic slope, land use, exclusions, urban extents, road transportation, and a graphic hillshade layer form the model input. This paper examines differences in the model's behavior when the obviously different environment of a European city is captured in the data and modeled. Calibration results are included and interpreted in the context of the two cities, and an evaluation of the model's portability and universality of application is made. Questions such as scalability, sequential multistage optimization by automated exploration of model parameter space, the problem of equifinality, and parameter sensitivity to local conditions are explored. The metropolitan areas present very different spatial and developmental characteristics. The Lisbon Metropolitan Area (the capital of Portugal) has a mix of north Atlantic and south Mediterranean influences. Property is organized in large patches of extensive farmland comprised of olive and cork orchards. The urban pattern of Lisbon and its environs is characterized by rapid urban sprawl, focused in the urban centers of Lisbon, Oeiras, Cascais Set??bal, and Almada, and by intense urbanization along the main road and train lines radiating from the major urban centers. The Porto Metropolitan Area is characterized by a coastal Atlantic landscape. The urban pattern is concentrated among the main nuclei (Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia) and scattered among many small rural towns and villages. There are very small isolated patches of intensive agriculture and pine forests in a topography of steep slopes. These endogenous territorial characteristics go back in time to the formation of Portugal - with a "Roman-Visigod North" and an "Arabic South" [Firmino, 1999 (Firmino, A., 1999. Agriculture and landscape in portugal. Landscape and Urban planning, 46, 83-91); Ribeiro, Lautensach, & Daveau, 1991 (Ribeiro, O., Lautensach, H., & Daveau, S., 1991. Geografia de portugal (4 Vols., published between 1986 and 1991). Lisbon, Portugal: Jo??o S?? de Costa)]. The SLEUTH model calibration captured these city characteristics, and using the standard documented calibration procedures, seems to have adapted itself well to the European context. Useful predictions of growth to 2025, and investigation of the impact of planning and transportation construction can be investigated as a consequence of the successful calibration. Further application and testing of the SLEUTH model in non-Western environments may prove it to be the elusive universal model of urban growth, the antithesis of the special case urban models of the 1960s and 1970s. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The cerebral theme in the layout of planned towns since antiquity has often reflected the image of cosmic harmony and perfection, unfolding in various notions of the Ideal City. The underlying adage of much of urban design and planning during modernity has continued to be the paradigms of accord in science and perfection in technology. Kindred to the notion of equilibrium in physical science, much of 20th century urban design too has seen to it that planned city-form addresses urban growth within the ideal of a balanced environmental, economic or social development. The notion of the Ideal City thus has remained implicit in urban design through to the present day. The motif of the 20th-century city, however, has not been composure and equilibrium proclaimed by the ideal. Rather, the factual contemporary city has been increasingly characterized by disparity, neurosis and disequilibrium. The gap between a blueprint, and its factual aftermath in the city, has led the fervent observer to the discernment of human fraud implanted in the mechanistic paradigm of modern city-form. The scientific remoteness of a city plan seems to have yielded a contradiction between urban existence and human essence: the city can reasonably guarantee individuals' survival, but in the process it appears to strip them of their own authenticity. The individual, through observation of self and other humans within the contemporary city, discerns that the only genuine sentiment emerging from the city's mechanistic ambience is that of meaninglessness, absurd, even insanity. The one humanly authentic virtue that contemporary city-form can still offer is not equilibrium but disequilibrium; not perfection but imperfection. Architecture of the 20th century seems to have acknowledged this distress on occasion by introducing deliberate imperfection as a design scheme. Commensurate consideration in urban design today, however, is still missing.\nThe cerebral theme in the layout of planned towns since antiquity has often reflected the image of cosmic harmony and perfection, unfolding in various notions of the Ideal City.

AB  - Llrban structure may be viewed as an abstract or generalized description of the distribution of phenomena in urban geographic space. The concept incorporates such ideas as pattern, distance, morphology, and relative location. Description of spatialI elements-linear features, nodes, and surfaces within urban areas-is but one facet considered in the study of urban structure, however. Explanation and prediction also form important, if not crucial, steps in understanding structural and behavioral changes in the urban system over time. Several methodological approaches have been utilized by urban researchers to achieve explanation and prediction; this study adopts the behavioral approach, defined as &dquo;an attempt to derive a set of empirically valid statements about individual, group, or mass behavior which can form postulates in a theory yielding statements of spatial structure as logical outputs&dquo; (Horton and Reynolds, 1971: 36). This paper takes the view that criminal mobility is related to urban structure and that the analysis of movement behavior will yield insight into offender decision-making and spatial preferences and contribute significantly to our understanding of the urban system as a crime opportunity structure. Robbery offenders are treated as the actors at varying geographical locations who, with a certain amount of information concerning the location of criminal opportunities in urban space, undergo a decision-making process that eventually leads to specific kinds of spatial behavioral biases. Specifically, the paper has three main objectives: ( I ) to describe the distance biases of robbery offenders in metropolitan Miami, (2) to offer explanations of these biases by examining certain concepts of individual behavior as they relate to movement within Miami’s urban system, and (3) to outline the authors’ ongoing research within the area of criminal mobility.

In this paper, Xiangtan City, in China, is chosen to be the typical city, and its central built-up area information, during 1973&#x2013;2008, is extracted by using remote sensing and GIS techniques. Urban expansion characteristics of Xiangtan City are systemically analyzed by using many indices, such as urban expansion speed, spatial expansion fractal characteristic, urban expansion's impact on local land use, and so on. According to temporal and spatial characteristics, and corresponding driving factors of Xiangtan City in the past 25 years, BP-CA model is constructed by considering advantages of back propagation neural network and cellular automata model in urban expansion simulation and prediction. Spatial expansion of the urban land in Xiangtan City during 2010&#x2013;2020 is simulated, evaluated and predicted. This study provides scientific master plan for land use and city.

AB  - Access to green spaces is important to physical activities and public health, yet one concern remains as to whether the disparities in green space access exist. This study aimed to (1) introduce an approach to quantify potential spatial accessibility to green spaces in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment; and (2) evaluate the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in green space access. Urban green spaces (n=890) in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia were collected from the Atlanta Regional Commission. A Gaussian-based two-step floating catchment area method was adapted to assess the spatial accessibility to green spaces at the census tract level. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model and the spatial lag model were used to evaluate the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. Results suggest that the spatial accessibility to green spaces in Atlanta was not evenly distributed. Both models show that neighborhoods with a higher concentration of African Americans had significantly poorer access to green spaces (P<0.05). Asian population had significantly poor access in the OLS model but not in the spatial lag model. Poor access was present in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas as well. Findings can be used for the city and regional planners to target the specific areas for green space development in order to elucidate the disparities. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The passenger flow forecast for intercity rail transit corridor has been studied under the guidance of the interaction mechanism between traffic system and urban spatial structure as well as the transit oriented development strategy. Following the control of land use pattern for newly-built areas in the intercity rail transit corridor, the geographical distribution weight of population was calculated using the land value. Then the weights of trip generation and trip attraction, which described the mechanism of traffic system to urban spatial structure, were formulated. When it came to the built-up areas, land use pattern was primarily applied to calculate the trip generation weight and trip attraction weight. This was a traditional and typical way that reflects the effect of urban spatial structure on traffic system. Furthermore, the passenger traffic forecast approach was presented for intercity rail transit corridor. The forecasting method not only depicts that the traffic demand can be satisfied but also reflects, more significantly, the real guiding role of the intercity rail system for urban spatial morphology and the traffic demand. Taking Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan intercity rail transit project as the background, the forecast approach has been applied to investigate and forecast the passenger flow demand for intercity rail transit corridor in the corresponding area.

AB  - During heat waves the death rate from heat-related ailments is often much higher in cities than in outlying environs. The higher death rate in cities appears to be a result of climate modification due to urbanization. Daytime urban-rural climatic differences are small. Nighttime urban-rural climatic differences, however, are often significant—air temperature is warmer within cities at night, long-wave radiant heat load is greater, wind speed is often lower, and inside air temperature of characteristic urban buildings is warmer. Noeturnal urban heat islands of 4–7° are shown to be associated with heat waves in two cities. During heat waves inhabitants of urban areas may experience sustained thermal stresses both day and night while inhabitants of the outlying environs often obtain some relief from thermal stresses during nocturnal hours. It is suggested that excess deaths occurring in urban areas during periods of extreme heat can be significantly reduced through appropriate urban land use.

AB  - Full article: Alor Star, Malaysia, 7th February 2013—A court case involving Malaysia’s biggest ever seizure of trafficked Tiger parts today saw the conviction of a 29-year old man, who was sentenced to a total 60 months in prison. However Mohd Nor Shahrizam Nasir, found guilty on two charges of illegal possession of Tiger parts and one for possession of African Elephant ivory, will only serve 24 months in jail as the judge ordered that his sentences run concurrently. A conviction under the section of the law involving Tiger parts also carries a mandatory fine of "not less than RM100,000 and not more than RM500,000 and a jail term not exceeding five years.” However, the court did not issue the mandatory fine. In February last year, he was arrested at this home where Wildlife Department officers found eight Tiger skins, 22 bags of Tiger skulls and bones and nine African Elephant tusks.  Mohd Nor Shahrizam, from the town of Alor Star in northern Peninsular Malaysia claimed trial to charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010. This morning he was handed down a sentence of 24 months each on the charges of keeping the eight Tiger skins, and the 22 Tiger skulls and bones. He received a further 12-month jail term on the third charge of keeping African Elephant tusks. Judge Mohd Rosli Osman granted the defence a stay pending an appeal and ordered that the convicted man’s bail, initially set at RM70,000, be increased by an additional RM10,000. If Mohd Nor Shahrizam raises bail, he will be free pending his appeal.   TRAFFIC welcomed the conviction but noted its concern that the sentence imposed contradicted the provision of the laws under which Mohd Nor Shahrizam was charged. “This is shocking given that the mandatory fine is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is also disappointing considering it has taken 13 years of hard work and the effort of so many to include a punitive minimum fine for heinous wildlife crimes,” said TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director Dr William Schaedla. TRAFFIC has learnt that the prosecution will seek a revision of the sentence. Schaedla also disagreed with the argument raised by the defence during the trial; that the crime in question was insignificant because it did not involve loss of life. “Such arguments fail to recognize that the arrest in this case was linked to the largest Tiger seizure Malaysia has ever seen – eight skins and the skulls and bones of 22 Tigers were impounded from the culprit’s Alor Star residence,” he said. “It also contradicts recent international developments that are putting wildlife crime on a par with other serious crimes such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking.” “The short jail term and the lack of a fine are a demoralizing finale to what should have been a victory against wildlife crime. We hope the lapse does not crush the spirit of those authorities who are still working hard to protect Malaysia’s 500 remaining Tigers.”

AB  - Urban structure type (UST) mapping is widely used for assessing the ecological situation in the frame of urban planning. A wide range of spatial indicators has been developed for quantitative characterization of USTs. This requires detailed urban surface material inventories. Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing allow automated identification of surface materials. In this paper, a multi-stage processing system for flexible calculation of urban land cover indicators is presented and applied to a study area in Munich, Germany. The system uses hyperspectral images and height information and includes the stages (1) preprocessing, (2) hyperspectral surface material mapping, (3) indicator calculation and (4) multi-level validation. In the study area 38 spectrally distinct surface materials have been automatically mapped. They form the basis for the derivation of 7 spatial indicators describing the urban land cover. The mean absolute error for the surface material identification amounts to less than 8% and for indicator calculation the mean errors range between 3 and 11%. The validation has shown the general suitability of the developed approach for analyzing large urban areas. Limitations occur in mapping of surface materials of small urban objects. Further statistical analysis has revealed typical combinations of indicator values for each UST. Finally, the results were compared to indicators estimated by the municipality of Munich, demonstrating that they are comparable to currently available mapping products. The presented study showed the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for efficient and up-to-date derivation of urban land cover indicators for use in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban growth refers to an increase in the absolute of people living in urban areas and the spatial expansion of those urban areas. The study of the past and present situations of an area gives the influential factors on the pattern of urban growth. In fact, it is possible to predict the future pattern if the growth can be properly modeled. The urban environmental problems are usually valid to a specific area (locally) because most of the land area is depended on its geography, social, economic and policy factors. The factors may be different from one place to another. In this paper, we propose a generic solution to detect urban growth pattern for any region of interest by using pixel-based approach. Digital images are captured using satellites. The images are processed using Geographical Information System (GIS) to classify the urban and rural areas. A Cellular Automata (CA) theory is applied to determine the states of all pixels before filtration and selection on any region of interest are performed. Later, a back propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm is used to detect the pattern of urban growth and provides the prediction for future growth. As a case study, we choose an area called Klang Valley (the place of most rapid urban growth) in Malaysia (a country in South East of Asia). With six imagery data set of a same location (for 15 years duration), we model the urban growth by focusing on the pixel based approach. In this way, future urban growth can be predicted based on the past history. In addition, it is possible to focus on certain region of interest in the digital map for any particular urban influential factor. Thus, urban monitoring can be carried out to help the ecological system as well as producing systematic planning for future living.

AB  - People learn the layout of cities mainly through a series of trips. Wayfinders experience the city structure differently depending on the mode of transport they use. The acquired mental representation then consists of the directly observed, physically accessible parts of the city. In this paper, we propose a computational model to construct images of cities, adapting their content depending on the wayfinder's access constraints. First, we formally study and extend the classification of Lynch's elements of the city form. Second, we propose a simple approach to analyzing local functional relationships between these elements, as experienced by wayfinders. The study of the functional relationships allows for the construction of the most complete image of the city that might be acquired by a wayfinder with given accessibility characteristics. These representations of urban environments can support advanced spatial assistance systems and cognitively efficient spatial interfaces. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the authors proposed that three components of urban land consumption be recognized in measuring urban land consumption: direct; indirect visible; and indirect less visible urban land uses. The indirect less visible uses are those that are present because of a nearby urban center, but which are not directly identifiable as urban, i.e., they are often difficult to distinguish visually from rural land uses. The indirect less visible component is comprises of two land use categories: the first is land used by exurbanites; the other is termed 'transitional land.' The latter category includes land that has not been built upon but which has started through the processes associated with urban development. This article describes a method for estimating the amount of land in the transitional category and applies the method in two study ares.

They may even distort our images of spatial patterns and relationships at one point in time.  One response to the definitional question is to develop a wide spectrum of definitions of the city, each one suitable for different purposes.  Then wthn patterns and relationships are compared across these differing sets of units we can then evaluate their sensitivity to changes in the size of the areas and the location of boundaries.  Ideally this spectrum of urban area definitions should be continuous and additive, with each "nesting" within a larger area.

AB  - Remote sensing based on mid-resolution multi-spectral data has proven a powerful tool in urban areas study. This work introduces a novel methodology based on spectral indices ratios for mapping urban changes in terms of impervious surface expansion. At the methodological core, the Soil and Vegetation Index (SVI), a spectral index aimed at discriminating urban from non-urban land cover, has been utilized over Landsat TM-ETM+ satellite data. As a case study, the approach was applied to a multi-temporal dataset, with the aim of mapping the urban growth of Milan, Italy, during 20 years (1984-2003). The multi-step processing framework is composed of: SVI values derivation and normalization, multi-temporal SVI ratios thresholding for identifying urban growth area, and multiscale segmentation of urban change maps produced. Results analysis showed the feasibility of the approach and reliability of urban change maps derived, which reached a value of Overall Accuracy up to 80%, while multi-scale assessment of results revealed the 25 pixels segmentation scale as the optimal one for urban change detection using Landsat data over the study area. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

With the help of single land use type dynamic degree model and expansion elasticity coefficient model, spatial-temporal features of urban land expansion in the recent 20 years in Harbin had been analyzed. The results showed that, firstly, urban land area had increased 123.93 km super(2), and it was more rapid during the period from 1996 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2008 with the annual expansion rates of 3.24% or 3.52%. Secondly, the urban expansion scale fluctuated within the rational region from 1989 to 1996. The expansion was much too quicker than the rate of population increasing from 1996 to 2002. And urban land sprawled continuously, but it was slower than the population increasing rate from 2002 to 2008. Thirdly, the expansion in SWS from 1989 to 1996 was more obvious, where area reached 3.61 km super(2). From 1996 to 2002, the expansion area in NWN and SWW was much larger, which was 18.37 km super(2) and 8.78 km super(2) respectively. And the expansion was much concentrated in the direction of NWW, with the area of 20.45 km super(2), which was mainly caused by the large scale construction in Songbei District. Fourthly, the driving mechanism influencing urban land expansion in Harbin had been discussed on the aspects of economy increasing, population amount, traffic traction and policy and urban plan etc., which was of some theory reference in directing the rational urban plan and promoting city in reasonable development.

AB  - Decomposition of an urban space into a set of relatively morphologically homogeneous entities, or urban structural units (USUs), offers a new descriptive perspective from which explanatory and interpretive insights may be derived to support urban planning and design. The USU is defined in terms of its component elements and their relationships, consistent with an integrated urban form classification framework intended to facilitate investigation (and potentially, intervention) across multiple scales. The present research illustrates the application of this framework through the disaggregation of a morphologically diverse suburban area – the municipality of Randwick in Sydney, Australia – into its constituent USUs, based on local configurations of built form, open space, vegetation structure and street pattern. The utility of the USU method is discussed with reference to the post-carbon city, addressing urban metabolism (material and energy flows) and urban microclimate. The Randwick USU plan is compared with the municipal land use plan, and differences are examined in the context of changes in use over time. A significant source of these discrepancies appears to be the adaptive reuse of existing buildings to support new functions, which not only preserves heritage building stock but reduces resource consumption and carbon emissions from new construction. The paper concludes that the structural description of an area through its USU plan complements the functional description given by a conventional land use plan, facilitating a variety of assessment methods which can provide data necessary for the planning, design and management of the post-carbon city.

AB  - Cities represent an important threat to biodiversity at different\nscales. Nevertheless, little is known on the processes underlying such\neffects. In this paper we describe bird diversity, structure, and\ncomposition patterns in different urban land-use categories. For this,\nwe surveyed resident bird communities in four representative land-use\ncategories of southwestern Mexico City. Our results show that bird\ncommunities vary greatly along the different studied urban land-uses,\nwhich represent an urbanization development gradient. Bird communities\nwere highly dominated by few generalist species in areas with commercial\ncomponents, while showed to have higher evenness values in green areas.\nBird species richness decreased and bird abundances increased with\nurbanization intensity. Also, our results indicate that bird species\nrichness and abundance values are sensible to site-specific habitat\ncharacteristics. Although we did not find a clear pattern of taxonomic\nhomogenization related to urbanization, our results show that\nurbanization development entails the functional homogenization of bird\ncommunities. Thus, based on our results, we suggest three urban planning\nand management activities: (1) regulate land-use change related to\nurbanization; (2) increase the number of green areas within the city;\n(3) establish bird monitoring programs to identify focal areas that need\nmanagement and assist with ecological data for urban planning.

AB  - The notion of 'creative cities' - where cultural activities and creative and cultural industries play a crucial role in supporting urban creativity and contributing to the new creative economy - has become central to most regional and urban development strategies in recent years. A creative city is supposed to develop imaginative and innovative solutions to a range of social, economic and environmental problems: economic stagnancy, urban shrinkage, social segregation, global competition or more. Cities and regions around the world are trying to develop, facilitate or promote concentrations of creative, innovative and/or knowledge intensive industries in order to become more competitive. These places are seeking new strategies to combine economic development with quality of place that will increase economic productivity and encourage growth. Against this increasing interest in creative cities, this volume offers a coherent set of articles on sustainable and creative cities and addresses modern theories and concepts relating to research on sustainability and creativity. It analyzes principles and practices of the creative city for the formulation of policies and recommendations towards the sustainable city. It brings together leading academics with different approaches from different disciplines to provide a comprehensive and holistic overview of creativity and sustainability of the city, linking research and practice. In doing so, it puts forward ideas about stimulating the production of an innovative knowledge for a creative and sustainable city, and transforming a specific knowledge into a general-common knowledge, which suggests best future policy actions, decision-making processes and choices for the change towards a human sustainable development of the city.

AB  - Full article: A project to promote sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plants in the mountains of China’s Upper Yangtze ecoregion has won the prestigious Equator Prize 2012.   The Equator Prize recognizes outstanding local initiatives working to advance sustainable development solutions for people, nature and resilient communities in countries receiving support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).   It is the second time the success of the project has been publicly acknowledged; in October 2011, the project received an “Outstanding Contribution Award” from the Chinese State Ministry of Environmental Protection, EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), Ministry of Commerce and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Over-harvesting of wild medicinal plant species is a serious conservation concern—aside from problems caused by the harvesting itself, the collectors can also have serious secondary impacts through camping within reserves, hunting and gathering fuel-wood to dry commercial quantities of medicinal plants. Such habitat destruction and disturbance also threatens endangered wildlife, including the Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the Takin Budorcas taxicolor.   The collection of medicinal plants in the Upper Yangtze is rising, with households compensating for loss of income from farming and timber logging due to the promulgation of two policies: a 1998 logging ban and a “Grain for Green” programme, introduced in 2000, which discourages farming on steep slopes.  To help alleviate matters, an initiative was developed through a comprehensive collaboration between WWF, IUCN and TRAFFIC as part of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), which led to local producer association members, harvesters and governmental officials receiving training in the implementation of organic wild crop harvesting practices and certification procedures, as well as application of the FairWild Standard principles.   “We are delighted to see public recognition of the success of this initiative, which has demonstrated how sustainable harvesting of wild plant resources creates positive benefits for local livelihoods and conservation efforts,” said Anastasiya Timoshyna, TRAFFIC’s Medicinal Plant Programme Leader.  Income for local producers in the project areas has increased, thanks to higher prices paid for certified sustainably harvested medicinal and aromatic plants. In the case of Schisandra berries Schisandra sphenanthera, international and local buyers paid at least 30% above normal market prices for certified produce. A survey of project sites in March 2011 found incomes from medicinal plant collection had risen, thanks to the certification schemes; in one village by almost 18% over 2007 levels.   The project also led to the establishment of links between producer associations and buyer groups: two communities have signed purchase agreements with a local winery and the newly established Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Cooperative has signed a 5-year fair trade agreement with a Californian company for supply of sustainably harvested Schisandra fruits.   In 2010, more than 5 tonnes (dry weight) of Schisandra fruits were sustainably harvested of which more than 3 tonnes were sold to Draco Natural Products (DNP Shanghai) for production of a concentrated dry extract specified by US-based Traditional Medicinals Inc (TMI). The project has scaled up from one village in the 2008 and 2009 harvests up to 22 villages in the 2011 harvest. From the autumn 2011 harvest, about 11.5 tonnes were shipped to DNP, enough to produce about 1.2 tonnes of certified organic dried extract for use in TMI products.   Further development of the project, supported through the Kangmei Institute of Community Development and Marketing has seen further adoption of sustainable harvesting methods in the region, and communities working through international partnerships to promote a ‘giant panda friendly’ brand and to create panda friendly certification standards for local harvesters.   “This project is proving that local harvesters from villages surrounding the Giant Panda conservation area can successfully implement meaningful sustainability standards,” said Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability for TMI.  “The Schisandra harvesters are helping to protect the panda bear habitat from disturbance while working to conserve biodiversity and earning additional household income through an organic and fair price premium.  “Traditional Medicinals remains committed to a long-term equitable trade relationship with the 22 participating villages represented by the Shuijing TCM Cooperative.   “Schisandra is only the first success story. As other wild medicinal plant species are added to the cooperative’s sustainable wild harvesting management plan, with eventual certified organic and panda friendly designations, household income will increase as a result of empowering and rewarding local communities for the important work of nature conservation.”

AB  - Open spaces and revenue sharing are analyzed within an urban-spatial framework. When households do not observe the price of the public good directly and because of the external economy arising from city size, the local government cannot determine the optimal property tax rate from empirical observation of consumer behavior. The relation between the property tax rate and city size is indeterminate. When land is necessary for public good production, there is an optimal amount of revenue sharing. The property tax rate alone, only under exceptional circumstances, can be used to limit city size and the amount of land in housing production.

AB  - First of all, systematic studies are conducted on the spatial variation of population in Hangzhou over more than 30 years, based on data from several national censuses including the most recent one, the fifth census in 2000. It is found that centripetal movements of population in Hangzhou dominated in the 1960s and 1970s, while centrifugal movements of population dominated and suburbanization occurred in the 1980s. Throughout the 1990s, the centrifugal movements and suburbanization of population greatly accelerated. This study also examines the distribution of temporary population in 1983, 1991, and 2000. Based on the spatial variation of total urban population during different periods and the distribution of temporary population in different years, models of the changes in internal urban spatial structure in Hangzhou are developed. By analyzing urban industrial land-use data and its distribution changes, we find that industrial suburbanization started and developed in Hangzhou in the 1980s, and that its pace has quickened during the period 1996-2000. Detailed descriptions and analyses are presented on the development of industrial suburbanization and the evolution of industrial spatial structure in Hangzhou. It is concluded that industrial suburbanization spurred the evolution of industrial spatial structure rationally and effectively in Hangzhou. Suburbanization of population and industry gradually deformed the shape of the Hangzhou urban area from handlike to fanlike one. Copyright © 2005 by V. H. Winston & Son, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rapid urbanization and spontaneous economic development has brought about profound changes in urban landscapes throughout the world. The task of managing transforming urban landscapes, particularly urban green spaces, so as to provide sufficient natural amenity for increasing urban populations, is one of the critical challenges facing policy makers. However, little empirical evidence exists about the evolving path of urban green spaces along with economic development and urbanization. This study attempts to fill in this knowledge gap through an econometric analysis of panel data across 285 Chinese cities during a period of rapid urbanization and economic growth (2001-2010). The results point to the existence of an N-shaped environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for an important aspect of environmental quality: urban green spaces. Urban green space coverage increases at the initial stage of economic development, and then it starts to decrease as GDP per capita exceeds RMB50,855 and then increases again at a high GDP per capita level (RMB107,558). Large elasticity (>1) is expected as GDP per capita grows to a higher level (beyond RMB128,095). By the end of 2010, 30% of Chinese cities are still located on the downward-sloping path and only four cities have attained elasticities greater than one. The findings present a challenging and pressing call for policy makers to effectively manage the tradeoffs between continuous economic development and better natural amenities.

(4) the European quartier, unlike the Latin-American barrio, appears to retain its motional autonomy and identity in spite of increasing city size; (5) the writer concludes that the present American conceptual framework is inadequate, and urges the collaboration of geographers and ecologists in future research. A scheme for a generalized 'urban profile' is presented, involving the conceptual integration of the two disciplines. W. D. Baker.

AB  - Urban areas can contain rich flora that contribute significantly to biodiversity, but loss and isolation of habitats due to urban sprawl threaten biodiversity and warrant limits on development. The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The unprecedented urban economic growth in China has created a huge demand for urban land. Built upon the standard monocentric city model, this empirical study investigates the determinants of urban spatial scale of Chinese cities using a cross-sectional dataset from 650 Chinese cities. The estimates are surprisingly similar to those found for US cities, with four basic factors (population, income, commuting cost and price of rural land) explaining most of the variation in urban spatial scale of Chinese cities. The findings clearly show that although land use in Chinese cities may have inherited many centrally planned features, market forces today exert a very significant influence. The study also shows that the urban spatial scale of Chinese cities is better understood by a model that consolidates features of both 'closed' and 'open' cities proposed in the standard urban land economics literature.

Using mobile phone network records, we have observed spatial patterns in community structures at ne spatial scales which are most likely related to the activities typical to the di erent functional regions of a city. It is known that interactions between di erent parts of the city are subject to a distance decay, moreover, our ndings show that regardless of the time of the day or current activity, people tend to communicate within a spatially enclosed community. Furthermore, we have investigated transitions and transformations of these communities at the temporal scales of several hours related to the cycles of human movement and activities in a city.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to present a critical view of theoretical works on city size. We begin with the consideration that, during the 1960s and 1970s, the question of optimal city size tended to be expressed in a misleading way. The real issue is not "optimal city size" but "efficient size", which depends on the functional characteristics of the city and on the spatial organisation within the urban system. Economies of scale exist up to a certain city size. However, urban development generates conditions leading to structural readjustments which may create new economic advantages. These structural adjustments may either be sectoral transformations towards higher-order functions, or increases in external linkages with other cities. The paper provides empirical evidence of these processes, and contains an econometric evaluation of urban location benefits and cost functions with respect to different levels of network integration, size and urban function. The model is applied to 58 Italian cities.

AB  - Based on remote sensing and GIS, SLEUTH model, a well-known cellular automata model, was applied to simulate urban development between 1988 and 2004 in Shenyang city. Future urban development was projected out to 2030 assuming two different urban development scenarios: (1) current trends development, (2) urban growth considering regional exploitation polices and urban planning. The results show urban growth area would be up to 306.0 km2 and 172.7 km2 in 2030, and urban area accounted for 22.1% and 18.3% of total land area under the two urban growth scenarios, respectively. The more dispersed urban development pattern was produced under the current trends scenario, which allows the continuous expansion of the surrounding towns. Under the regional exploitation policies and urban planning scenario, however, the compact growth pattern shows the control and guide action of future regional development and preservation policies and urban planning.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical study of the links between metropolitan spatial structure and economic growth. Consistent with an urban evolution hypothesis, the growth effects of employment dispersion were found to be dependent on metropolitan size. A metropolitan area with a more clustered spatial form grows faster, perhaps enjoying agglomeration economies when it is small; whereas more dispersion leads to higher growth rates as metro areas grow large. Just as a city needs to successfully take on higher-order functions and economic activities to move upward within the national urban system, it also needs to restructure its spatial form in a way to mitigate congestion or other diseconomies of size for continued growth. Therefore, attempts to find one specific efficient urban form – at least with respect to growth – may not be promising, just as the efforts to find an optimal city size have not been fruitful.

AB  - Environmental quality is an abstract concept resulting from both human and natural factors operating at different spatial scales. In urban areas the local scale is dominated by individual buildings, streets and trees, but regional scale influences may include the whole city and beyond. This paper demonstrates the ability of current satellite-based sensing systems to depict parameters of urban environmental quality over large areas at detailed level, using 3D Virtual Reality models. A method is described for increasing the spatial detail and spectral accuracy of Landsat FTM+ thermal data, by fusion with an IKONOS image representing vegetation. Additionally, by depicting the complete radiating surface involved in energy exchange between the surface and atmosphere, including vertical walls, as well as the horizontal surfaces 'seen' by the satellite, a more accurate representation of the urban thermal environment is obtained. The models permit 3D visualization and fly-through animation to represent urban environmental quality, based on quantifiable image parameters, and assist the understanding of the complex and dynamic factors controlling urban environmental quality.

Several models of an urban structure resembling buildings and canyons were constructed by using concrete blocks in cubic form. By building and dismantling the urban models, the albedo change as a function of solar zenith angle was observed throughout the year. The result shows that the absorption increment originating from the irregular urban structure amounts to about 20% as compared with the absorption by a flat surface of the same material. The amount of additional absorption depends on the relative area occupied by canyons in the model.

AB  - Managing and modelling urban growth is a multi-faceted problem. Cities are now recognised as complex systems through which non-linear processes, emergence and self-organisation occur. The design of a system that can handle these complexities is a challenging prospect. This paper presents an urban planning application for the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. At the core of the application is a Fuzzy Cellular Automata Urban Growth Model (FCAUGM) which is generally capable of simulating the complexities of urban growth. The chief components of the model are outlined and quantitative and qualitative methods of validation are described. The results of the validation show that the model is to a large extent successful at replicating the spatial patterns over time for Riyadh although closer examination reveals several minor anomalies which cannot readily be explained. The authors conclude that the model offers significant benefits for simulating urban growth and change, for urban planning and decision-support for policy makers and others, but further research will be necessary on methods of validating and interpreting the detailed results. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2009.

Since urban trees positively affect quality of life, the spatially inequitable distribution of urban trees in relation to race and ethnicity is yet another instance of urban environmental inequality that deserves greater consideration in light of contemporary and dynamic property relations within capitalist societies.

AB  - Recent approaches to modeling urban growth use the notion that urban development can be conceived as a self-organizing system in which natural constraints and institutional controls (land-use policies) temper the way in which local decision-making processes produce macroscopic patterns of urban form. In this paper a cellular automata (CA) model that simulates local decision-making processes associated with fine-scale urban form is developed and used to explore the notion of urban systems as self-organizing phenomenon. The CA model is integrated with a stochastic constraint model that incorporates broad-scale factors that modify or constrain urban growth. Local neighborhood access rules are applied within a broader neighborhood in which friction-of-distance limitations and constraints associated with socio-economic and bio-physical variables are stochastically realized. The model provides a means for simulating the different land-use scenarios that may result from alternative land-use policies. Application results are presented for possible growth scenarios in a rapidly urbanizing region in south east Queensland, Australia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A place exists in a space (footprint) which evolves over a temporal extent (lifeline). This study focuses on those places such as cities or component places within cities (hereafter referred to as city places or simply places). It concerns the modeling and analysis of places from the integrative spatio-temporal perspective. Drawing on recent research development related to spatio-temporal ontology, this study discusses a spatio-temporal ontology specific to city places. The ontology distinguishes between the static view of places (Static-Place) and the dynamic view of spatial-temporal regions led by spatio-temporal processes (ST-Place). The study considers places as spatio-temporal constructs. It proposes the concept of primitive ST region for the construction of spatio-temporal regions and ultimately spatio-temporal places. The study then presents a spatio-temporal data model to link spatial features and the spatio-temporal processes. In this way, the study models an ST-place from a spatio-temporal perspective by forming high dimensional spatio-temporal regions. Based on this conceptual data model, the study further discusses the potential use of this model in spatio-temporal analysis in general and in reasoning spatio-temporal topological relations in particular.

AB  - Over the past three decades, research in urban politics or increasingly urban governance reveals a landscape powerfully reflecting what might now be defined as a post-political consensus. Following a waning of the community power, urban managerialist and collective consumption debates, this ‘new urban politics’ has appeared conspicuously absorbed with analysing a purported consensus around economic growth alongside a proliferation of entrepreneurially oriented governing regimes. More recent contributions, acknowledging the role of the state and governmentalities of criminal justice, uncover how downtown renaissance is inscribed through significant land privatisations and associated institutionalised expressions like Business Improvement Districts and other ‘primary definers’ of ‘public benefit’: all choreographed around an implicit consensus to ‘police’ the circumspect city, while presenting as ultra-politics anything that might disturb the strict ethics of consumerist citizenship. Beyond downtown, a range of shadow governments, secessionary place-makings and privatisms are remaking the political landscape of post-suburbia. It is contended that the cumulative effect of such metropolitan splintering may well be overextending our established interpretations of urban landscapes and city politics, prompting non-trivial questions about the precise manner in which political representation, democracy and substantive citizenship are being negotiated across metropolitan regions, from downtown streetscape to suburban doorstep. This paper suggests that recent theorisations on post-democracy and the post-political may help to decode the contemporary landscape of urban politics beyond governance, perhaps in turn facilitating a better investigation of crucial questions over distributional justice and metropolitan integrity.

AB  - The role of human-independent dispersal vectors in the structuring of urban flora is hardly known. Our goal was to evaluate the role and scale of endozoochorous seed dispersal mediated by the rook into habitats located in 11 cities of eastern Poland. This bird is a frequent user of anthropogenic food sources: agricultural fields (outside the cities) and garbage cans and refuse dumps (inside the cities). We wanted to: (i) assess the seed pool dispersed by the rook during wintering, when the bird forms huge winter roosts in the centre of cities, and (ii) evaluate if the rook-mediated dispersal may cause homogenization of vegetation at the sites where seeds were deposited. We found 2257 seeds belonging to 60 taxa in 1008 regurgitation pellets; the proportion of archaeophytes in pellets was significantly higher than in vegetation under roosts and it was negatively correlated with city size. On the basis of the Jaccard index we can conclude that the dispersed seed pool is more homogenous than stabilized vegetation in sites where pellets were deposited, but because of the high participation of weeds and ruderal species in pellets, the bird can facilitate the transfer of these groups of species into the cities. Plant and animal dispersers interactions should be further studied and taken into consideration during the planning and management of urban green space, which is claimed to be the most important habitat type for conservation of biodiversity within modern cities. It is especially important in the case of abundant animals forming huge concentrations in the urban landscape because of their high potential impact on vegetation composition at the local scale. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Full article: Geneva, Switzerland, 26th July 2012—Statisticians from the University of Reading in partnership with TRAFFIC are helping in the global fight against the trade of illegal ivory, with a major revision of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), a global monitoring system for tracking illegal ivory trade.  With elephant poaching levels the worst they have been in a decade, and recorded ivory seizures at their highest levels since 1989, the revised system will give accurate and up-to-date information on the illegal trade of ivory. This will be of huge benefit for international and national policy makers on elephant conservation and on illicit trade who have previously struggled to get reliable and timely data.  At the heart of the upgrade is an innovative new database that allows countries to report seizures of illegal ivory online, making data entry easier and more accurate than ever before.  It will also encourage more countries to report illegal ivory trade as they will be able to access statistical summaries of their data and review other seizures where their country is implicated.  TRAFFIC manages ETIS on behalf of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is one of two elephant monitoring systems under CITES, the other being the Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) system.  The revised online ETIS will be showcased today at the CITES Standing Committee currently taking place in Geneva. In attendance will be representatives from many of the CITES Parties who will use the revised system. They will witness the functionality and the effectiveness of the database by way of a demonstration, ahead of its launch in September 2012.  Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood, statisticians from the University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, have worked closely with TRAFFIC to develop the revised ETIS. Dr Underwood, project leader, said: "We are very pleased that we are able to provide a solid statistical foundation to ETIS to ensure that it provides high quality and timely information on the illegal ivory trade at a crucial time for elephants." Recording illegal ivory seizures is just one aspect of the revised monitoring system, which now has enhanced capability to provide indicators of hidden illegal activity.  Applied Statistics Research Fellow Bob Burn, who conceived the current project and has been involved with ETIS since its inception in 1997, said: "Not all illegal ivory transactions are discovered or officially reported.  The challenge in analysing seizures data is to adjust for this gap by accounting for factors such as law enforcement effort and corruption. Using cutting edge statistical methods the monitoring system can now begin to combat this problem."  The statistical analyses will provide information on how patterns of illegal trade are changing over time and will identify problem countries so that attention can be focused upon those countries most heavily implicated in illicit trade. This provides crucial evidence for CITES and individual governments in their decision making when it comes to elephant conservation. The work was carried out under a Darwin Initiative project, led by the University of Reading, funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  UK Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: "These magnificent creatures are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers, and if we don't act now they may not have a future. This database, funded by Defra's Darwin Initiative, will accurately record illegal ivory seizures so we get a real picture of what is happening on the ground. This information can be shared around the world to help stop the illegal trade in ivory and put poachers out of business."  TRAFFIC's Tom Milliken, who manges ETIS, added: "Since 1997, our long-term collaboration with Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood from the University of Reading has progressively scaled up the science behind ETIS and made it a ‘best practice', state-of-the-art monitoring tool for the global conservation community.  TRAFFIC, but also elephants, trumpet their appreciation to Bob and Fiona and the Darwin Initiative!"  The database was developed in collaboration with Solertium Corporation, USA.

Dichos factores tienen que ver, por un lado, con ciertas manifestaciones del arte, por otro, con los estudios sociológicos y urbanísticos que se mueven hacia el terreno de la antropología, la etnología y la ecología y, fundamentalmente, con la incidencia de las nuevas tecnologías de la información y la comunicación en la generación de redes sociales y una ciudadanía proactiva. La última parte del artículo está dedicada a los tipos emergentes de espacios informales, los usos alternativos del espacio público y la participación ciudadana. A partir de estas nuevas situaciones dadas se pretende promover un pensamiento crítico sobre las nuevas prácticas en expansión y sus posibles puntos de convergencia con nuevas formas de proceder desde el punto de vista tanto de la política como de la profesión del urbanismo y de la arquitectura en la coyuntura social y económica actual.     Palabras clave:   Redes, participación, espacios alternativos, crisis, sostenibilidad     Abstract      The analysis, understanding and proper configuration of urban spaces. The article aims to study the factors causing this change in the perception of urban life that has direct consequences on how to intervene in the urban space. These factors have to do, on the one hand, with certain forms of art, on the other, with sociological and urban studies that are close to the fields of anthropology, ethnology and ecology, but mainly, with the impact of new information and communication technologies in a generation of social networks and proactive citizenship. The last part of the article is dedicated to the emerging types of informal spaces, and the alternative uses of public space and citizen participation. From these new given situations we intent to promote a critical thinking about these expanding new practices and their possible points of convergence with new ways to proceed from the point of view of both politics and the profession of urbanism and architecture in the current social and economic situation.

AB  - Ecological land is one of the most important components of urban Social-Economic-Natural Complex Ecosystem, it can provide various important ecosystem services for urban areas. Using Remote Sensing, Geography Information Science technology and landscape index analysis software, focusing on the scientific problem of urban ecological land and ecosystem services, on the basis of analyzing four-phase remote sensing images of Changzhou in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006, we got the evolution of landscape spatial structure of Changzhou during the past 15 years and assessed changes of ecosystem services generated by urban ecological land. The results show that the ecological land proportion of land-use decreased from 89. 2% to 65. 1%. During 1991 to 2001, the areas of forests, fields and water had a decreasing tendency. During 2001 to 2006, the areas of forests turned back to that of 1996. Ecological land in Changzhou have provided ecosystem services including agricultural and forestry production, climatic regulation, conservation of water resource, soil and water conservation, biodiversity protection, etc. During 1991 to 2006, the value of ecosystem services provided by ecological land has reduced 19. 3%. The decrease of ecosystem services value provided by agricultural lands was the largest of all and it decreased 32. 3%. The results showed strong correlation between landscape spatial structure and ecosystem services of Changzhou city. This paper can provide scientific methods and decision making for strengthening of urban ecosystem services, land use planning and management, urban sustainable development, etc.

AB  - Vulnerability is a new field and analytical tool in the study of urban safety. Analysis and assessment of vul- nerability provide a new basis for urban planning. This study constructed a quantitative index system for assessing vulnerability, based on the city′s sensitivity and emergency response capacity. City size, density, and spatial form in- fluence a city′s sensitivity to crises and risks, to which vulnerability is positively related. Levels of socio-economic development, infrastructures, and emergency management contribute to a city′s emergency response capacity, with which vulnerability is inversely associated. Vulnerability of 19 large Chinese cities was assessed. Harbin and Shenzhen demonstrated the highest and lowest vulnerability among 19 cities, while Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou ranked the 5th, the 9th and the 12th. Spatially, northern cities tended to be more vulnerable than southern cities. And the differ- ences in vulnerability among cities were explored based on cities′ physical geography conditions, level of socio- economic development, infrastructures, regional status, history of disaster, history of urban planning and development, government policies, etc.

AB  - Mounting interest in the global system of cities has led many scholars\nto portray large, world-class cities as control points in the global\neconomy. From this position, they govern global banking, finance\nand international corporate relations with the assistance of advanced\n\nbusiness services and telecommunications. While large cities have\ntaken on many global functions, recent research has cast them only\nas outposts in the global economy and pays little attention to their\nrole in regional and national economies. This paper explores the\nrole of five large US cities in regional and national economies.\nUsing primary trade data for five high-order business services, we\nidentify the extent to which these large cities trade with other\nlarge cities of the US urban system, smaller-sized cities, and test\nstatistically the effect that firm attributes and physical characteristics\nof the city system have on shaping the areal extent of large city\ninteraction (trade). The results indicate that: trade is consistently\nbiased towards other large cities; the size of origin cities is associated\nwith the size of destination cities; and, distance more so than destination\ncity size plays the dominant role in shaping large city patterns\nof trade.

AB  - Many states in the USA attempt to manage urban growth so that development is directed to urban areas equipped to accommodate development, and rural lands are preserved for resource and other non-urban uses. The state of Oregon is entering its third decade of what many commentators describe as the nation's most aggressive urban growth management programme administered statewide. This article reports a recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the state urban growth management policies as they are implemented by the metropolitan Portland area. The metropolitan Portland area contains the largest population, employment and land base within a single urban growth boundary in the USA. Using primary data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the urban growth management and resource land preservation effort is assessed. Nearly all regional development has been directed to the urban growth boundary and away from resource lands. Many problems with administration are found, however. Policy implications are suggested.

AB  - Fieldwork at Tiwanaku sites in recent decades has opened new avenues of inquiry into the characteristics of the Tiwanaku polity, but archaeology has been hampered by the inability to make large-scale characterizations of the organization of urban and monumental space because of the depositional processes that interred its cities and monuments. In this paper, we use several geophysical techniques, including magnetometry, electrical resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar to begin to visualize some of these spaces. In doing so, we outline a methodology for recreating the urban spatial structure of the six-square-kilometer Tiwanaku capital. Our preliminary work compares excavations at the Putuni, Mollo Kontu, and Akapana East sectors with geophysical data that has expanded our understanding of both residential and monumental spaces to provide a first glimpse at the potential of imaging Tiwanaku’s buried urban structure

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study the hierarchical structure of the Canadian urban system and to determine the growth processes. Zipf’s law is rejected for the whole country for all periods because of a clear size-domination by a few big cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. It appears that the dynamics of growth follow a deterministic process related to existing urban size, previous growth and spatial structure. Splitting the Canadian urban system into two—east and west— permits the identification of differences that were not observable when studying the country as a whole. While size and previous growth are still important explanatory variables of growth patterns, these two systems may be distinguished one from the other from the point of view of spatial patterns of distribution of growth rates.

AB  - The urban spatial structure of Chinese cities has been changing since the post-Mao economic reform in 1978. More dramatic changes have occurred since the housing reform in 1982 and land reform in 1987. This article examines the transformation of urban spatial structure in China in the context of a transitional economy and its underlying dynamics. The land use changes in Guangzhou are used for a case study. The major findings are rapid decentralization through leapfrog developments in peripheral areas and the re-emergence of business and service areas in the city centre. The authors present a model of a new urban spatial structure and discuss its implications for urban planning. © American Planning Association.

AB  - Currently, many major Western cities aim to be attractive to new and economically successful high-tech industries, financial and business services, cultural industries and consumer services industries. Most of these new activities are dependent upon well-skilled creative workers, which will be followed by those who will work in personal services. It is said that a large share of the well-skilled and creative workers requires impulse-rich and attractive urban environments. The idea has arisen that highly segregated, socially and culturally less integrated cities, do not match the newly required city profiles. On the contrary, these cities would exacerbate urban poverty and deter skilled people from settling there. Consequently, some believe that todays cities should also be socially and culturally cohesive. This hypothesis parallels policies against segregation and policy interventions in favour of more mixed and balanced local communities. The latter type of policy is also driven by the idea that more mixed neighbourhoods will enhance individual social opportunities and thus, on aggregate, strengthen the urban economy. This paper elaborates on these ideas and hypotheses and focuses on the rise of new economic activities and the locations they aim for, their potential relation with the social (and ethnic) segregation of the population and the related impact upon the attraction of creative workers and the possible impact on the social mobility of the population. Empirical data from Europe are used to support the arguments.

AB  -  The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between the surface temperature distribution and urban structure in Tokyo metropolitan area. ASTER data and LIDAR data both are used for this analysis. The daytime (2001.9.24 at 10:39 JST) and night (2001.9.22 at 21:54 JST) scenes of ASTER TIR are used for the surface temperature in daytime and night. The same daytime scene of ASTER VNIR is also used for the land-cover. LIDAR data, 3D point clouds from the remote airborne mapping system, is used for the building height. As results, the distribution of the surface temperature is high at residential areas and low at business centers and main roads in daytime, and then it is reversed in night. The correlation between the surface temperature and the urban structure shows 1) green areas have a good impact on the urban heat environment and these areas are not enough, and 2) tall buildings make shadows and fall the surface temperature in daytime, but raise it for obstructing winds in night.

AB  - Urban green space ecosystem has the functions of gas regulation, harmful gas and dust absorption, and noise reduction, playing an important role in improving urban environment and ensuring human health. These purification services also provide a basis for realizing urban sustainable development. The evaluation of the environment purification service value of urban green space ecosystem in Qingdao City, in combination with the analysis of green space distribution and its construction process under the situation of population increase, could provide a theoretical basis for the urban planning, ecological city construction, and urban green space construction of the City, and for the improvement of its urban environment as well as the sustainable development of the city ecosystem. From 1999 to 2009, the total urban green space in Qingdao had increased from 7005.4 hm2 to 16002.8 hm2, with the green space per capita increased from 30.20 m2 to 58.09 m2, public green space per capita increased from 7.35 m2 to 14.54 m2, green coverage rate of built-up area increased from 35.90% to 43.20%, and the numbers of zoos and botanical gardens increased from 36 to 73. Both the population and the urban green space in Qingdao urban area in 2009 had the characteristics of spatially uneven distribution. Comparatively, the four urban districts (Shinan, Shibei, Sifang, and Licang) had a larger and denser population but a smaller green coverage rate of built-up area and smaller public green area; while the three suburb districts (Laoshan, Chengyang, and Huangdao) had a smaller and sparser population, but a larger green coverage rate of built-up area and larger public green area per capita. Based on the spatiotemporal dynamics of green space in Qingdao from 1999 to 2009, the annual environment purification service value of urban green space ecosystem in the City was calculated by using market value method, production cost method, and displacement cost method, and the results indicated that in 1999-2009, the environment purification service value of urban green space ecosystem in the City increased dramatically from 1.587×108 yuan RMB to 3.491×108 yuan RMB, with the service value per capita increased from 68.42 yuan RMB to 126.73 yuan RMB. In the eleven years, the net increase of the service value was 1.904×108 yuan RMB, with the average annual increasing rate being 10.91%. In the total purification service value, the service value of gas regulation accounted for 49.81%-51.72%, and that of harmful gas and dust absorption and noise reduction accounted for 48.28%-50.19%. The gas regulation service of urban green space had the transferability in locality, which could be compensated by the natural ecosystems out from urban areas, while the service of harmful gas and dust absorption and noise reduction was the one which had no transferability in locality. To intensify the urban green space construction and to enhance the greening level would be the effective measures in improving the urban environment quality and human habitation standard of Qingdao. In methodological aspect, the indices yearly carbon-fixation and oxygen release amounts per unit area of urban green space adopted by Liu Yunlong et al. (2009) were modified, but there still had two aspects that should be modified. First, appropriate methods should be adopted to eliminate the influence of US Dollar exchange rate to RMB on the calculation of yearly carbon-fixation survive value, and the second, the environment purification service value of urban green space ecosystem should be calculated by using the areas of forestland, shrub land, and grassland, if the data could be provided, to obtain more accurate results.

AB  - Although contracting-out has become widespread among the OECD countries in the last couple of decades, there is limited knowledge about the arrangements chosen by urban green-space managers when contracting-out. In this paper, I take our current knowledge a step forward and present a comprehensive overview of the 'infrastructure' of contract designs used for contracting-out in urban green-space management. On the backdrop of a cross-national sample of a total of 14 cases from four countries, I build up a 'toolbox' of instruments, approaches and arrangements currently used by public clients for managing contracts with private contractors. In six major categories of instrument, I distinguish 41 specific instruments, and 15 embedded approaches for managing these instruments. Both instruments and approaches are grouped into standard and advanced kinds. Arrangements are categorized into three major types. Each type is characterized by a core combination of instruments and approaches and a limited range of variants. Finally, I explore national differences and organizational reasons supporting and directing the choice of overall contractual arrangement. For both the practitioner and the researcher, the paper can be used to inspect, compare, design and develop instruments, approaches and arrangements available in the toolbox of urban green-space management. ?? 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Analysis is presented of the short-run and long-run welfare implications of policies for promoting urban growth for LDCs.  It is shown that the effects of tariffs, urban wage subsidies and urban production subsidies in the short run, in which capital is immobile, do not carry over to the long run with capital mobility.  Policies for promoting urban growth reduce the urban unemployment ratio in the short run, but, by contrast, raise the urban unemployment ratio in the long run.  Along with agglomeration economies and inter-sectoral externality, the urban unemployment ratio plays a key role in determining social welfare.  Three traditional policy options of a small open economy are discussed.

Unlike previous port-city models, this one can generate four land-use patterns, that is, monocentric, completely integrated, partially integrated (with integration at the center), and partially integrated (with integration at the urban fringe) land-use patterns, and the last pattern suggests a new explanation of suburbanization of employment. The existence and uniqueness of each land-use pattern is proven in a simple constructive way. -Author

AB  - In a monocentric city with a well-functioning residential market, Pareto-efficient spatial equilibrium entails the sorting of residents according to their bid-rent gradient in descending order away from city center. Violation of this sorting condition creates opportunities for Pareto-improving trading of locations and can be sustained only if the market is hindered. We propose a simple ordered-location-choice model using matched location and location-preference data of individual households to examine violations of the Pareto-efficient spatial sorting condition. In so doing we are able to identify population groups facing housing-choice hindrances. We find in a sample of Chinese cities undergoing housing market liberalization that poor marketability of the previously state-provided homes, inadequate provision of housing finance, and spatial mismatch between job-market and housing-market opportunities contribute to a Pareto-inefficient spatial structure. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.
