AB  - Selective non-catalytic redn. (SNCR) using urea soln. injection was applied to a HG-410/9.8-YW15 boiler on the base of conventional pulverized-coal reburning process.  Expts. were mainly conducted under 280, 345 and 410 t/h.  Results showed that NOx emission was below 200 mg/m3 (std. condition, 6% O2 vol. fraction, dry gas) when SNCR was operating, namely a NOx redn. of 40%-60%.  It was favorable to inject urea soln. using the injection layer where the hearth temp. was about 950 DegC, higher or lower might be disadvantageous to NOx redn. and the lower temp. also resulted in more ammonia slip.  The increase of layer's injection vol. flow rate could improve NOx redn. efficiency, the economical injection vol. flow rate in the exptl. range was 1.0-1.6m3.h-1 and the larger injection vol. flow rate also led to lower emission of NH3 and N2O.  But the water injected into the hearth resulted in a decrease of boiler efficiency by almost 0.5%. [on SciFinder (R)]

AB  - This paper introduces an asset-focused framework whose objective is both analytically to better understand, and operationally to more appropriately address, the different phases of urban climate change (CC) as it impacts on poor urban communities. After an overview of current CC adaptation approaches, it describes the two asset adaptation framework components; first, an asset vulnerability analytical framework that appraises the vulnerability groups most affected by CC-related disasters, and second, an asset adaptation operational framework that identifies CC strategies at individual, household and community level in four phases of long-term resilience; pre-disaster damage limitation; immediate post-disaster response; and rebuilding. It concludes by describing its associated methodology. The paper aims to assist CC researchers and those supporting the poor protect and rebuild assets during CC-related disaster processes.

Starting with the exposition of the physical principles underlying LDF, we first describe the various devices developed to perform LDF in these vascular beds. We then discuss the clinical protocols, blood flow parameters, calibration procedures, reproducibility and limitations of the LDF technique. Various problems still need to be solved in order to bring to light the full potential of LDF in the assessment of microcirculatory haemodynamics.

AB  - Fundamental understanding of the complex behavior of small droplets or particles in wall bounded turbulence and their interaction with the surrounding fluid is critical in a number of industrial processes. One approach for gaining valuable insight is the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence in conjunction with numerical computation of particle trajectories. Most previous work was limited to dilute suspensions of non-colliding particles. Part I of this paper extends previous methods by allowing for interparticle collisions. Part II presents results for the rate of collision between aerosol droplets.

AB  - A large-eddy simulation study has been undertaken to investigate the turbulent structure of open-channel flow over three-dimensional (3D) dunes. The governing equations have been discretized using the finite volume method, with the partial cell treatment being implemented in a Cartesian grid form to deal with the 3D dune topography. The simulated free surface elevations, mean flow velocities and Reynolds shear stress distributions have been compared with experimental measurements published in the literature. Relatively close agreement has been obtained between the two sets of results. The predicted mean velocity field and the associated turbulence structure are significantly different from those observed for flows over two-dimensional dunes. The effects of dune three-dimensionality are reflected in spanwise variations of mean flow fields, secondary currents and different distributions of vertical profiles of the double-averaged velocity. Furthermore, large-scale vortical structures, such as spanwise rollers and hairpin-like structures, are predicted in the simulations, with most of them being generated in the concave regions of the 3D dunes.

AB  - Purpose – This paper aims to develop enhanced surfaces that possess improved heat transfer rate with moderate flow pressure-drop. Design/methodology/approach – The characteristics of the heat transfer and flow resistance in a parallel-plate channel with flow-inclining fins have been numerically and experimentally studied. In the turbulent flow range, the effect of the fin angle from 0 to 23.2° in addition to three channel heights, has been investigated. Findings – The friction factor and the Nusselt number of the experimented 3D finned ducts are both lower than those of the numerical 2D channel at the same Reynolds number. The assessment under the constraint of the same pump power consumption shows that the enhancement ratio, Num/Nu0, is in between 1.6?~?3.3. Showing different priority, the fin of ß=23.2° is the most profitable for the 2D channel, while the case of ß=16.0° is superior to the other fin angles for thicker 3D ducts. Research limitations/implications – For wide flat channels the 3D fins rather than the 2D fins are profitable. The deployment of the 3D fin, which is unchangeable in the current study, should be further optimized. The fin dimension and configuration in other duct forms are also challenging subjects. Practical implications – The results can be referenced by those who engage in design of plate-fin heat exchangers. Attention should be paid to the optimum fin angle for different aspect ratios of the duct. Originality/value – The study provides a practical fulfillment of the effective enhancement of the convective heat transfer with properly designed inserts that the field synergy principle predicted.

AB  - A turbulent natural convection flow (Ra = 1.58 × 109) in a confined cavity with two differentially heated side walls was numerically investigated by means of large eddy simulation (LES). The mean flow in the cavity is characterized by stable thermal stratification and a relatively low turbulence level. The LES results for the mean flow quantities show good agreement with the experiment. This is particularly the case when the dynamic model is used. Nevertheless, there are some discrepancies in the prediction of turbulence statistics, particularly in the outer region of the near-wall flow where the boundary layer interacts with the recirculating core region. In the viscous/conductive sublayer of the boundary layer close to the heated/cooled vertical walls, the flow tends to form streak-like structures, which do not however emerge in the near-wall flow along the horizontal top and bottom walls. To resolve the flow structure near the vertical walls, sufficient grid resolution is required. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban flow is a phenomenon of the interaction and relation between the\ncities in the region based on the transport network and urban synthetic\nstrength. And, because of the difference in traffic conditions and the\nlevel of economic development in different city, the intensity of the\nurban flow of each city is different and the primary effecting factor is\ndissimilar. The traditional analysis on the effecting factors of urban\nflow concerns the background of the entire region as a whole entity,\nwhich would be too vague and ignore the difference in the effecting\nfactors of different cities as well as the micro differences and spatial\nnon-stationarity in the dominant factor. The research on spatial\ndifference in the effecting factors of the urban flow in this paper\nfocused on the analysis of the diverse effecting factors of urban now\ncaused by the regional disparity; found out the primary factors; and\nanalyzed the spatial characteristics of effecting factors using GIS. We\nestablished a mathematical model, which was applied to the urban\nagglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta, the intensity of the urban\nflow of every city in this district was figured and the regression model\nwas constructed. The principal effecting factor of the urban flow of\nevery city and its characteristic of the spatial distribution was\nanalyzed. we summarized the effecting factors of the urban flow is an\nindication of the persistence of spatial difference among Yangtze River\nDelta, and the spatial pattern of it was investigated.

AB  - A computational investigation was conducted on rarefied hypersonic flow past truncated wedges at incidence. Positive angle-of-attack effects on the aerodynamic surface quantities have been investigated by employing the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method. The results presented highlight the sensitivity of the heat transfer coeffcient, the total drag coeffcient, and the total lift coeffcient to changes not only on the angle of attack but also on the frontal-face thickness of the leading edges. Some significant differences between sharp and blunt leading edges were noted on the surface quantities. Interesting features observed in these surface properties showed that even small leading edge thickness, compared to the freestream mean free path, still has important effects on high Mach number leading edge flows. The analysis is of great importance since it is mpossible to achieve ideally sharp leading edges of airframes, such as waveriders.

AB  - Landslides are one of the most important processes supplying debris flow materials into channels. We need to predict the timing, location, and volume of landslides for better estimation of the occurrence of debris flows. However, a number of soil parameters (e.g., the angle of internal friction, cohesion, and porosity), which have significant spatial variability, are needed to predict landslide occurrence. Therefore, it is important to make clear the contribution of these parameters to overall slope stability and their relationships to one another. In this study, we normalized the safety factor equation for infinite slope model, and introduced multi soil layer structure into the model. We also tried to clarify factors affecting the pore water pressure on the basis of the equations for the vertical infiltration process (i.e., continuity equation and Darcy's law). Depth gradient of the pore-water pressure at the given soil layer is controlled by the ratio of the water velocity in saturated zone to the hydraulic conductivity at that layer. New, non-dimensional representations for the effects of groundwater table and cohesion of soil were obtained by the normalization of the safety factor equation. They are evaluated relative to each other by comparison to the stability of dry non-cohesive soil. The effect of the groundwater table and the cohesion of soil on the slope stability are both affected by depth of the sliding surface. We also found that the effect of cohesion should be evaluated from the comparison with the maximum effect of groundwater table to the stability. This can explain the immunity of post-landslide slopes to immediately subsequent landslides, as well as the cyclical nature of landslide processes. © 2011 Casa Editrice Università La Sapienza.

AB  - This paper presents the findings of an experimental study on the three-dimensional turbulent flow field in the vicinity of a rectangular cross-section cylinder placed at the sidewall of a rectangular open channel. Uniform sand of median diameter 0.52 mm was glued over the channel bottom to make it rough. Detailed measurements of the time-averaged velocity components, turbulent intensity components, turbulent kinetic energy and Reynolds stresses were taken by the acoustic doppler velocimeter (ADV) at different vertical sections around the cylinder. In the upstream, presentation of flow fields through vectors at vertical and horizontal sections show a primary vortex associated with the downflow near the cylinder. On the other hand, in the downstream, the flow field shows a three-dimensional separated flow with vortex shedding. Using the Reynolds stresses and velocity gradients, the bed shear stresses are determined. In front of the cylinder, the velocity and the bed shear stress are found to be approximately 1.6 and 3.3 times of their magnitudes at free flow upstream zone, respectively. The data presented in this paper would be useful to the investigators for the development and verification of mathematical models of flow field in the vicinity of vertical-wall abutments. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The modulation characteristics of the turbulent wall shear stress measured in a plane diffuser subjected to imposed velocity oscillations are presented. The measurements reported in this paper pertain to nearly 150 different flows: imposed oscillations with three amplitudes and six frequencies, two different diverging channels and four streamwise positions. Only the most significant data are analyzed and discussed. The imposed unsteadiness affects the time-mean flow under the effect of the adverse pressure gradient (APG), in contrast to the canonical unsteady turbulent wall layers. The laminar viscous solution that adequately describes the amplitude and phase of the wall shear stress in channel flows in the high-imposed frequency regime is no longer valid in unsteady turbulent boundary layers subjected to APG. The latter modifies also the behavior of the phase shifts of the modulations in the turbulent quantities. The time lag of the wall shear stress turbulent intensity decreases as the pressure gradient increases. Some of these structural modifications are explained by the effect of the eddy viscosity that plays a key role in the vorticity diffusion process as the APG increases.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental investigation of a scaled down model of a PGT10 gas turbine diffuser by Nuovo Pignone S.p.A. The model was designed to operate in geometric and Reynolds number similarity with the GT diffuser, and 24 guide vanes are mounted at inlet to reproduce typical inlet conditions of an industrial gas turbine diffuser. The PGT10 diffuser has also six high-solidity struts, which support one of the shaft bearings and have lubricating oil supply inside. Two step-motors are used for the circumferential and radial displacement of the probes. Airflow through the test model is provided by an open circuit wind tunnel, which is powered by a 21 kW centrifugal fan. Two hot split-film probes in constant temperature mode were used to measure velocity fluctuations in main-flow, cross-flow and radial-flow directions, thus allowing a 3D characterization of the model's flow field. Results are presented in terms of mean and fluctuating velocity components at different axial positions. The discussion is focused on the distortion of the flow produced by the struts and on the separation around the hub and the shell. A first set of measurement defines the flow field from the inlet to the exhaust at four axial sections. In three additional axial positions, behind the struts, a more detailed analysis has been made with measuring grid with a double number of nodes. The investigation of the flow field inside the diffuser is also presented by means of the turbulent scale of dissipating eddies, calculated with the Kolmogorov theory. The Kolmogorov length scale seems to be a powerful means to study fluid dynamic phenomena. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Calculations were performed at channel flow\nReynolds numbers, Re-tau, of 180 and 644 (based on friction velocity and\nchannel half width); subgrid-scale stresses were parametrized using the\nLagrangian dynamic eddy viscosity model. Particle motion was governed by\nboth drag and gravitational forces and the volume fraction of the\ndispersed phase was small enough such that particle collisions were\nnegligible and properties of the carrier flow were not modified.\nMaterial properties of the particles used in the simulations were\nidentical to those in the DNS calculations of Rouson and Eaten\n{[}Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Two-Phase Flow Predictions (1994)]\nand experimental measurements of Kulick er al. {[}J.

Statistical properties of the dispersed phase in the\nchannel flow at Re-tau=180 are in good agreement with the DNS;\nreasonable agreement is obtained between the LES at Re-tau=644 and\nexperimental measurements. It is shown that the LES correctly predicts\nthe greater streamwise particle fluctuation level relative to the fluid\nand increasing anisotropy of velocity fluctuations in the dispersed\nphase with increasing values of the particle time constant.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The umbilical vein is the major source of blood for the fetal liver, but portal blood, which has not been measured directly in human fetuses, probably constitutes a physiologically important contribution. We aimed to establish a method for measuring blood flow in the fetal portal vein and to produce longitudinal reference ranges for diameter, blood flow velocities and volume blood flow during the second half of pregnancy. METHODS: After a pilot project to develop the measuring technique, 160 low-risk pregnant women were recruited to a longitudinal study that included ultrasound examinations at 4-5-week intervals starting at 20-22 weeks of gestation. The inner diameter (D) of the vessel was measured with a perpendicular insonation angle, and the time-averaged maximum blood velocity (TAMXV) and weighted mean velocity (VWMEAN) were recorded with an insonation directed along the long axis of the vessel. Portal flow was calculated as: Q = pi(D/2)(2) x h x TAMXV (where h is a velocity profile parameter and equals 0.5). Portal flow was normalized for estimated fetal weight based on birth-weight percentiles. RESULTS: The portal vein could be visualized and measured in 558/593 (94%) cases. Blood flow was pulsatile. D and TAMXV doubled during the second half of pregnancy (21-39 weeks), from 1.5 to 3.4 mm and from 8.4 to 14.9 cm/s, respectively. Correspondingly, the portal flow increased from 5 to 41 mL/min, and from 10 to 13 mL/min/kg when normalized for fetal weight. Similar results were achieved for VWMEAN. CONCLUSION: Portal flow can be measured with a standardized technique. It increases during the second half of pregnancy, even when normalized for fetal weight, suggesting that it has increasing importance in the fetal liver circulation.

AB  - Whereas Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of single-phase flows is already widely used in the CFD world, even for industrial applications, LES of two-phase interfacial flows, i.e. two-phase flows where an interface separates liquid and gas phases, still remains a challenging task. The main issue is the development of subgrid scale models well suited for two-phase interfacial flows. The aim of this work is to generate a detailed data base from direct numerical simulation (DNS) of two-phase interfacial flows in order to clearly understand interactions between small turbulent scales and the interface separating the two phases. This work is a first contribution in the study of the interface/turbulence interaction in the configuration where the interface is widely deformed and where both phases are resolved by DNS. To do this, the interaction between an initially plane interface and a freely decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) is studied. The densities and viscosities are the same for both phases in order to focus on the effect of the surface tension coefficient. Comparisons with existing theories built on wall-bounded or free-surface turbulence are carried out. To understand energy transfers between the interfacial energy and the turbulent one, PDFs of the droplet sizes distribution are calculated. An energy budget is carried out and turbulent statistics are performed including the distance to the interface as a parameter. A spectral analysis is achieved to highlight the energy transfer between turbulent scales of different sizes. The originality of this work is the study of the interface/turbulence interactions in the case of a widely deformed interface evolving in a turbulent flow. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of LES for a flow around a\nthree-dimensional axisymmetric hill. Two aspects of this simulation in\nparticular are discussed here, the resolution and the inlet boundary\nconditions. In contrast to the LES of flows with sharp edge separations\nwhich do not require the near-wall dynamics to be fully resolved, the\nhill flow LES relies on the resolution of the upstream boundary layer\nin order to provoke the separation at a correct position. Although\naround 15 x 10(6) computational cells were used, the resolution of\nstreaky structures in the near-wall region that are important for a LES\nis not achieved. Two different inlet boundary conditions were used: the\nsteady experimental profile and the time-dependent boundary conditions\nproduced from DNS results of low Reynolds number channel flow. No\nsignificant improvement in the results was obtained with the unsteady\ninlet condition. This indicates that, although the unsteady inlet\nboundary conditions may be necessary for a successful LES of this flow,\nthey must be followed with the resolution of the boundary layer for a\nsuccessful LES.

AB  - Simultaneously developing three-dimensional laminar flow and heat transfer in the entrance region of trapezoidal channels have been investigated using numerical methods in the Reynolds number range from 10 to 1000. The principal and secondary velocity fields, the temperature field, and all associated heat and momentum exchange parameters have been examined. The present results for the fully developed flow region of the channels compare well with the available literature. In the entrance region, it is observed that the axial velocity profiles develop overshoots near the walls and particularly at the channel corners. It is shown that boundary-layer type of approximations, which lead to Reynolds-number-independent Poiseuille and Nusselt numbers, can be used for Reynolds numbers over 50 and after a few hydraulic diameters from the channel inlet. It is also shown that hydrodynamic entrance lengths calculated with methods based on fully developed flow data are grossly in error. New correlations are proposed for the entrance length, and for the friction and heat transfer coefficients.

It is shown that very large-scale structures exist in the outer layer and that they certainly contribute to inner layer structures at high Reynolds number. Moreover, it is revealed that very large-scale structures exist even in the wall shear-stress fluctuations at high Reynolds number, which are essentially associated with the very large-scale structures in the outer layer.

AB  - The deformation dynamics of a compound liquid droplet in shear flow is numerically investigated in two- and three-dimensional space. The computational model is based on the immersed boundary method. This accurately and efficiently tracks the interfaces of immiscible multi-phase fluids. We extend a recently developed volume-conserving immersed boundary method for two-phase fluid flow to ternary compound droplet flows. For long time simulations, we also apply a surface remeshing algorithm. Chorin's projection method is employed, and the resulting system of discrete equations is solved by a multigrid technique. We study the effects of radius, interfacial tension ratios, and inner droplet location on the deformation of a compound droplet, and compute the inclination angles of inner and outer droplets. Simulation results indicate that the angle of the inner droplet is always greater than or equal to that of the outer one. The effect of wall confinement on compound droplet deformation is compared with that of a simple droplet. The result shows that the more confined the wall is, the more different the compound and simple droplets' behavior. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Direct numerical simulation of wall-normal rotating channel flow with heat transfer has been performed for the rotation number Nτ from 0 to 0.1, the Reynolds number 194 based on the friction velocity of non-rotating case and the half-height of the channel, and the Prandtl number 1. The objective of this study is to reveal the effects of rotation on the characteristics of turbulence and heat transfer. Some statistical turbulence and heat transfer quantities, including the mean velocity, temperature and their fluctuations, turbulent heat fluxes, and turbulence structures, are investigated. Based on the present calculated results, two typical rotation regimes are identified. When 0<Nτ<0.06, the turbulence statistics correlated with the spanwise velocity fluctuation are enhanced since the shear rate of spanwise mean flow induced by Coriolis force increases; however, the other statistics are suppressed. When Nτ>0.06, all the turbulence statistics are suppressed significantly. To elucidate the effects of rotation on the turbulent heat transfer, the budget terms in the transport equation of turbulent heat fluxes are analyzed. Remarkable change of the direction of near-wall streak structures of the velocity and temperature fluctuations, nearly in alignment with the absolute mean flow direction, is revealed. An attempt to evaluate the mean spacing and the direction of streaky structures near the wall has been examined based on the two-point correlations of the velocity and temperature fluctuations.

A three-component laser Doppler velocimeter system was used to measure three mean velocity components, all six Reynolds stress components, and all ten velocity triple product correlations. Independent measurements of skin-friction obtained with a laser oil-flow interferometer were used to examine the law of the wall in adverse pressure gradient flows where p+ < 0.05. Strong similarities were seen between the two adverse pressure gradient flows and free shear layer type flows. Eddy viscosities, dissipation rates, and pressure-strain rates were deduced from the data and compared to various turbulence modeling assumptions.

The critical concentration gradients (the Marangoni diffusion numbers) necessary for the initiation of mass transfer of a liquid along the interface were determined as dependent on the rate of inflow of a tongue of a more concentrated solution and the initial alcohol concentration around the bubble.

AB  - The lateral force on a tethered rigid sphere submerged in a turbulent, uniform shear flow of water was measured. Periodic and non-periodic motions of the sphere were observed depending on flowrate, shear and sphere density. The direction of the observed lateral force was opposite to that predicted by inviscid theory and increased in magnitude as the sphere's Reynolds numbers based on relative velocity, Re, and average shear, Re(nabla) increased. The lateral force was found to correlate with the product Re Re(nabla). The data suggests that a sign reversal occurs at relatively small values of the product Re Re(nabla), where the lateral force is dominated by inviscid effects. The results are explained assuming that the lateral forces on rigid spheres are a consequence of two competing factors: namely, inviscid lift forces and the vortex shedding-induced lateral forces which are dominant for higher Reynolds numbers. An estimate of the kinetic energy in the wake was used to show that the vortex shedding-induced lateral forces correlate with the product Re Re(nabla) and are in a direction opposite to the inviscid lift force. Combining the experimental data of this study with similar data a correlation for the lift coefficient of spheres in turbulent shear flows was developed. This correlation is applicable to turbulent multiphase flows having a spherical dispersed phase.

Infrared thermography was applied to measure the surface temperature at the cube walls, from which the distribution of the local heat transfer coefficient was determined. The velocity field and its structure were evaluated from Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements and flow visualizations. The spatial periodicity was confirmed from flow field and heat transfer measurements across the entire matrix. The results showed that the flow has a marked vortex structure only in the immediate proximity of the cube, while the flow above the cube and in the streamwise corridors was only mildly distorted, except for a high level of turbulence intensity. Flow separation at the sharp leading top and side edges led to flow recirculations with subsequent flow reattachment at these faces. Reattachment of the top shear layer at the channel floor downstream of the cube produced a two-cell structure in the inter-obstacle space: an arc-type vortex in the wake of the upstream cube and a horseshoe-type vortex in front of the downstream cube. Flow instabilities caused vortex shedding at the side faces of the cube which led to periodic motions in its wake. The measured Strouhal number showed a constant value of St = 0.109 over the range of Reynolds numbers considered. The observed local flow structure, in particular flow separation and reattachment, caused marked variation in the distribution of the local heat transfer coefficient, with large gradients detected particularly at the top and side faces of the cube.

AB  - It has been shown that there is a large eddy simulation LES evolution, the ideal LES, that guarantees accurate single-time statistics and at the same time produces the most accurate short-time dynamics of the simulated turbulence. In optimal LES, models are constructed by formally approximating ideal LES using stochastic estimation. In this paper, optimal LES modeling is applied to the turbulent flow in a channel, using statistical data from a direct numerical simulation to form the stochastic estimates. Due to the data requirements, the modeling process pursued here does not directly yield generally applicable LES models; instead, the current study provides information on the required characteristics of subgrid models for wall-bounded turbulence. In the channel flow, and other wall-bounded flows, the strong inhomogeneity near the wall introduces several complications. There is a mean subgrid stress that must be represented, and there are subgrid contributions to turbulent transport. It is found that formulating the optimal LES models to reproduce a priori the important terms in the Reynolds stress transport equations was necessary to produce accurate LES. Models formulated this way were found to produce good predictions of mean velocity, wall shear stress and turbulent intensities. The results of this study indicate that for inhomogeneous flows, the subgrid model must represent processes other than transfer of energy to small scales. Specifically, it must represent subgrid transport, mean subgrid Reynolds stress and subgrid intercomponent transfer due to pressure strain. ©

AB  - Heat transfer in fully developed turbulent pipe flow with isoflux condition imposed at the wall is investigated numerically by use of direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large eddy simulation (LES) for various rotation rates (0???N???7) at a Reynolds number equal to 5500. To validate the present computations, predictions are compared to the results reported in the archival literature, and found to agree fairly well with them. With increasing rotation number, the temperature fluctuations decrease near the wall and are enhanced in the core region. The pipe rotation induces a reduction of the streamwise turbulent heat flux and an obvious augmentation of the azimuthal one, especially near the wall. Thus, heat transfer between fluid and wall is reduced. For higher rotation numbers (N>3), the flow and the scalar transport become nearly insensitive to N. Joint probability density functions sketch the correlation between flow and thermal fields. Visualization of the temperature field exhibits the stabilizing effects of the centrifugal forces. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The unsteady behavior of the large-scale vortical structures buried in a wall-bounded turbulent shear layer flow was extensively investigated using pressure-velocity joint measurements. The wall pressure fluctuations and flow field velocity fluctuations were measured simultaneously by using a microphone and an X-type hotwire, respectively. The spatially and temporally strong coupling between the convecting flow structures and the wall pressure fluctuations were meticulously investigated in terms of the continuous wavelet transform, cross-correlation and coherence of the wall pressure and flow field. The characteristics of the large-scale vortical structures, e.g., the shedding frequency, averaged convection velocity, convective motion, and structure pattern were revealed.

AB  - The spatial development of the inlet velocity profile in a uniformly porous channel and tube is investigated. For tubes which are very long compared with their radius, it is shown that above a critical Reynolds number of 2.3 the inlet velocity profile does not necessarily decay into the fully developed, similarity profile for an infinite tube. Rather, the structure of the flow throughout the entire tube is influenced by the inlet profile. This loss of validity of the similarity solution is due to the fact that the tube is of finite length and the inlet profile is not of the similarity form. The actual length of the tube is, however, unimportant. Analogous results hold for the flow in a porous channel, with a critical Reynolds number of approximately 6.

AB  - Particle entrainment process in a turbulent channel flow is studied. The time history of the instantaneous turbulent velocity vector field is generated by the direct numerical simulation of the Navier–Stokes equation with the aid of a pseudospectral code. The equation of motion of submicrometer particles including Stokes drag and Brownian diffusion is used, and typical entrained particle trajectories are evaluated and statistically analyzed. It is shown that the wall coherent structure plays a dominant role on the particle entrainment process. Particles are removed from the wall region by being captured in the high speed streams moving away from the wall, which are formed by the flow structure. Furthermore, single streamwise vortices are shown to be more frequent than pairs of counter‐rotating ones at every instance of time. Temporal average of the vorticity field, however, shows roughly periodic sequence of counter‐rotating vortices in the wall region.

AB  - Direct numerical simulations of heat transfer in a fully developed turbulent pipe flow with isoflux condition imposed at the wall are performed for a Reynolds number based on pipe radius Re = 5500. Main emphasis is placed on Prandtl number effects on turbulent heat transfer in pipe flow. The scaling of mean temperature profiles is investigated in order to derive correct logarithmic law for various Pr. The rms of temperature fluctuations and turbulent heat fluxes are found to increase when increasing Prandtl number. The turbulent Prandtl number, Prt, is almost independent of the molecular Prandtl number Pr for Pr ??? 0.2. The radial distributions of higher order statistics (skewness and flatness) confirm the intermittent behaviour at the close vicinity of the wall; this intermittent behaviour is more pronounced with an increase in Pr. The Nusselt number is in good agreement with the findings of the literature. Probability density functions and joint probability density functions of velocity and temperature fluctuations are used to describe the characteristics of the turbulent flow and heat transfer. The instantaneous flow and thermal fields are plotted in order to analyse the turbulent structures. To explore the impact of the wall curvature on turbulent heat transfer, predictions were compared to available results for channel flow. These comparisons show a slightly more intense temperature fluctuations in the pipe flow. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developing entrance flows are of interest in a large number of application areas. They have been widely studied in the past, but many aspects of these flows are not yet fully understood. One of the questions concerns the stability and turbulent transition in the entrance region of a channel. The present study investigates by direct numerical simulation (DNS) the laminar-turbulent transition induced by boundary layer interaction in a spatially developing flow near the entrance of a channel, where the laminar flow is linearly stable. For uniform inlet flow conditions and at sufficiently high Reynolds number, the turbulent transition actually takes place inside the boundary layers and well before the fully developed regime. The transition of one of the two boundary layers is triggered near the entry section by small amplitude perturbations, such as the ones created by small isolated obstacles distributed on the wall. These generate elongated streaks, and their transient growth and breakdown lead to the turbulent transition of the boundary layer near the entrance region. The transition of the second boundary layer is induced by the interaction with the first further downstream. After the transition of the second boundary layer, turbulence occupies the whole channel width and a turbulent channel flow develops. The transition is analyzed with the help of an orthogonal decomposition of the solenoidal velocity field. The observed transition scenario differs from existing simulations of streak breakdown where the perturbation is optimized for a transition to occur in a region far away from the entry section. In our simulations, the perturbation setup generates a significant nonlinear growth of the streaks that are pushed away from the wall. Transient varicose instabilities, followed by sinuous instabilities induce the development of mushroom-shaped transitional structures in the outer region of the laminar boundary layer, that further break down downstream. The second boundary-layer transition resembles the one occurring under freestream turbulence, with the generation of finite-length streaks and turbulent spots. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Environmental flow studies normally involve sampling. Except for hydrologically based methods, the studies usually are conducted only on part of the reach of stream to which the study results will be applied. This assumes that the study sites, or the samples, are representative of the stream as a whole. There is no way to be sure of this without studying the whole stream, but it is possible to estimate how close the study results and the true results are likely to be, if the study uses a probability random) sampling design that allows for estimating confidence intervals. Sampling designs that allow for interval estimates of statistics are normal in science, but, strangely, not in environmental flow studies. Here, I describe and discuss some appropriate sampling designs and related considerations in the context of environmental flow studies. I then describe and critique the sampling in some recent studies using the Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM), the method most commonly used in the United States, which I describe briefly for readers not familiar with it. Finally, I explain why deliberate selection of samples gives biased results, and describe the experience that persuaded statisticians of this fact early in the twentieth century.

In thepresent work we investigate the energy growth of eigenmodes andnon-modal optimal disturbances. We present a set of linear governingequations for the parabolic evolution of wavelike disturbances validboth for the exponential and algebraic growth scenario. The base flow istaken as the {Falkner–Skan} similarity solution with favorable, adverseand zero pressure gradients. The optimization is carried out over theinitial streamwise position as well as the spanwise wave number andfrequency. The exponential growth is maximized in the sense that theenvelope of the most amplified eigenmode is calculated. In the case ofalgebraic growth, an adjoint-based optimization technique is used. Wefind that the optimal algebraic disturbance introduced at a certaindownstream position gives rise to a larger growth than for the optimaldisturbance introduced at the leading edge. The exponential andalgebraic growth is compared and a unified transition-predictionmethod based on available experimental data is suggested.

AB  - A direct numerical simulation is performed for stagnation- region flow with free- stream turbulence. A fully implicit second- order time- advancement scheme with fourth- order finite differences and an optimized scheme are employed. The optimized scheme is developed to save computational cost. The free- stream turbulence is a precomputed field of isotropic turbulence. The present DNS results in the " damping'' and " attached amplifying'' regimes are found to be similar to those of the organized inflow disturbances. Emphasis is placed on the flow and temperature fields in the " detached amplifying'' regime. The contours of instantaneous flow field illustrate that streamwise vortices are stretched in the streamwise direction by mean strain rate. The temperature field is also stretched in the streamwise direction near the wall. The surface contours reveal that the temperature field is influenced significantly by streamwise vorticity. Due to the dominance of the mean strain, the log- law region is not observed for (u) over bar and (T) over tilde, the inner scaling fails, but the outer scaling works. The single- point turbulence statistics and the turbulent statistics budgets are obtained. The flow statistics reflect the typical characteristics of stagnation- region flow which are generically different from those of other canonical shear flows. One of the typical features of the budgets is that the velocity pressure correlation and the turbulent transport play significant roles in the stagnation- region flow. Finally, the present simulation data are compared with experimental results. It is found that the effect of large- scale eddies on the enhancement of wall heat transfer is substantial in the turbulent stagnation- region heat transfer. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Purpose - This paper sets out to perform a detailed numerical study of turbulent channel flow with strong temperature gradients using large-eddy simulations. Design/methodology/approach - A recently developed time-accurate algorithm based on a predictor-corrector time integration scheme is used in the simulations. Spatial discretization is performed on a collocated grid system using a flux interpolation technique. This interpolation technique avoids the pressure odd-even decoupling problem that is typically encountered in collocated grids. The eddy viscosity is calculated with the extension of the dynamic Smagorinsky model to variable-density flows. Findings - The mean velocity profile at the cold side deviates from the classical isothermal logarithmic law of the wall. Nonetheless, at the hot side, there is a better agreement between the present results and the isothermal law of the wall. Further, the numerical study predicts that the turbulence kinetic energy near the cold wall is higher than near the hot one. In other words heat addition tends to laminarize the channel flow. The temperature fluctuations were also higher in the vicinity of the cold wall, even though the peak of these fluctuations occurs at the side of the hot wall. Practical implications - The findings of the paper have applications in the design and analysis of convective heat transfer equipment such as heat exchangers and cooling systems of nuclear reactors. Originality/value - The paper presents the first numerical results for non-isothermal turbulent channel flow with high wall-temperature ratios (up to 9). These findings can be of interest to scientists carrying out research in turbulent flows. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

The channel had a cross-sectional area of 80 ?? 160 mm2 with blocks 10 ?? 25 mm2. The experiments covered the following range: Reynolds number (Re) 6670-40 000, the hole inclination angle (0) 0-45??, the perforation open-area ratio (??) 0.05-0.15, the diameter of the perforations (D) 2.5-8.0 mm, and the number of the blocks (Nb) 2-7 (giving the ratio of the distance between the blocks to the channel hydraulic diameter (Sx/Dc) 1.407-0.309). The blocks were transverse to the main flow. It was observed that the heat-transfer enhancement increased with increasing ??, ?? and D and decreasing Sx/Dc and Re. The pressure drop was not affected by ?? while it decreased with increasing D, Re, Sx/Dc, and ??. Correlation equations were developed for the average Nusselt number (Nu) and the friction factor (f). Performance analysis indicated that the solid blocks could lead to energy loses up to 20% despite significantly enhanced heat-transfer due to the increased surface area. The energy lost was recovered by perforations opened in the blocks by which means it was possible to achieve energy gains up to 40%. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research in the area of laminar flow control (LFC) dates back to the 1930’s when early applications of stability theory led to the observation that laminar boundary layers can be stabilized by either favorable pressure gradients or small amounts of wall suction. (An excellent summary of this work is presented in References 1 and 2.) Research was performed in many countries to explore approaches for achieving extensive laminar flow with these concepts. Stabilization of boundary-layer disturbances and instabilities by pressure gradient and shaping became known as natural laminar flow (NLF), and NACA research led to the development of the six-series NLF airfoil. International research on stabilization by suction, referred to as LFC with suction, was intensive at the same time and culminated in the United States in the 1960’s with flight tests of a relatively unswept suction glove on an F-94 aircraft (Reference 3) and X-21 flight tests (References 4–7) of a totally new swept LFC wing on a reconfigured WB-66 aircraft.

AB  - {Astract&nbsp;&nbsp;The} present study is a contribution to the analysis of wall-bounded compressible flows, including a special focus on wall modeling for compressible turbulent boundary layer in a plane channel. large eddy simulation ({LES}) of fully developed isothermal channel flows at Re&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,000 and Re&nbsp;=&nbsp;4,880 with a sufficient mesh refinement at the wall are carried out in the Mach number range 0.3 ≤ M ≤ 3 for two different source term formulations: first the classical extension of the incompressible configuration by Coleman et&nbsp;al. (J. Fluid Mech. 305:159–183, 1995), second a formulation presently derived to model both streamwise pressure drop and streamwise internal energy loss in a spatially developed compressible channel flow. It is shown that the second formulation is consistent with the spatial problem and yields a much stronger cooling effect at the wall than the classical formulation. Based on the present {LES} data bank, compressibility and low Reynolds number effects are analysed in terms of coherent structure and statistics. A study of the universality of the structure of the turbulence in non-hypersonic compressible boundary layers (M≤5) is performed in reference to Bradshaw (Annu. Rev. Fluid. Mech. 9:33–54, 1977). An improvement of the van Driest transformation is proposed; it accounts for both density and viscosity changes in the wall layer. Consistently, a new integral wall scaling (y c+) which accounts for strong temperature gradients at the wall is developed for the present non-adiabatic compressible flow. The modification of the strong Reynolds analogy proposed by Huang et&nbsp;al. (J. Fluid Mech. 305:185–218, 1995) to model the correlation between velocity and temperature for non-adiabatic wall layers is assessed on the basis of a {Crocco–Busemann} relation specific to channel flow. The key role of the mixing turbulent Prandtl number Pr m is pointed out. Results show very good agreement for both source formulations although each of them involve a very different amount of energy transfer at the wall.

AB  - Large eddy simulation (LES) has been applied to turbulent thermal fields in a channel having one wavy wall for Prandtl number = 0.7. Wall wave amplitude is changed in three steps. Increasing the wall wave amplitude, a flow separation bubble comes to appear and a separated turbulent shear layer develops above the separation bubble. Additionally, in the up-slope region of the bottom wavy wall, near-wall streamwise vortices are generated with larger population. These two turbulence features, i.e., the separated shear layer and the near-wall streamwise vortex, play an important role for the heat and momentum transfer near the wavy wall. So, the characteristics of the separated shear layer and the near-wall streamwise vortices are discussed in relation to the turbulent heat transfer. For this purpose, vortical flow structures aligned toward the streamwise direction and turbulent thermal fields around the vortices were captured and the statistical quantities relating to the turbulent thermal fields were scrutinized. Especially, attention is paid to the effect of the near-wall streamwise vortices on the turbulent heat transfer and the conditionally averaged patterns of turbulent thermal fields around the streamwise vortices were established. The results obtained indicate that the near-wall streamwise vortices produce the strong events of QT4 and QT6. Here, QT4 and QT6 are cold sweep-like motion and hot ejection-like motion, respectively. Especially, QT4 event makes the gradient of fluid temperature near the wall steeper in the up-slope region and consequently enhances the heat transfer at the bottom wavy wall. Furthermore, with increasing the wall wave amplitude, the near-wall streamwise vortices were strengthened and as a result the wavy wall heat transfer is more noticeably enhanced. In practical view point, if pumping power is kept the same, better heat transfer performance can be achieved with increasing wall wave amplitude. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heat transfer in a plane laminar shear flow configuration consisting of two infinitely long plates orientated parallel to each other is investigated theoretically. The upper plate, which is planar, drives the flow; the lower one, which is fixed, has a regular sinusoidally varying profile. A closed form analytical solution for velocity, based on lubrication theory, together with a semi-analytic one for temperature, from application of Ritz's direct method, is derived for creeping flow. In addition, detailed numerical solutions are obtained from a finite element formulation of the weak form of the governing equations for mass, momentum and energy (temperature) conservation, enabling the effects of inertia to be explored. It is shown that changes in the mean plate separation, that is the geometry, and the level of inertia present affect the local hydrodynamic flow structure in the form of kinematically and inertially induced eddies, respectively. These in turn impact on the local "laminar thermal mixing", and consequently enhance the global heat transfer. Results are reported for a wide range of Pecl??t, Reynolds and Nusselt numbers with agreement between the two methods of solution, for the case of creeping flow, found to be extremely good. The key flow features that emerge are(i)For creeping flow and varying Pecl??t number, the thermal field is asymmetric for all values of the Pecl??t number other than the limiting conditions of zero and infinity, at which extremes the corresponding thermal field is symmetric. In the limit of infinite Pecl??t number the eddy becomes a basin of fluid at uniform temperature.(ii)Global heat transfer in the case of creeping flow, expressed in terms of the Nusselt number, for a given Pecl??t number increases as the mean plate separation decreases, that is as the local kinematically induced eddy structure becomes more pronounced.(iii)There exists a subtle interplay between variations in the mean plate separation and the level of inertia imposed, in that both influence the presence or otherwise of eddies. Starting from a creeping flow condition the introduction of inertia can in addition both enlarge and skew an existing eddy. When this information is condensed to a series of Nusselt number curves the indication is that it should be possible, from a practical standpoint, to find a critical mean plate separation, for a given Pecl??t number, for which local inertially influenced eddy effects on the global heat transfer are at a minimum. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this study, the evolution of the velocity field and scalar concentration fields in stably stratified shear flow is studied using direct numerical simulations. Two cases with vertical mean shear and horizontal mean shear are compared. In both cases, the growth of the turbulent kinetic energy weakens as the Richardson number is increased. However, the horizontal shear case shows a stronger growth of the turbulent kinetic energy than the vertical shear case for a given Richardson number. The ordering of the velocity components was found to change from streamwise > horizontal > vertical in the vertical shear case to streamwise > vertical > horizontal in the horizontal shear case. The fluctuation level of a passive species variable with a vertical mean gradient was observed to be stronger in the horizontal shear case. The ratio of the vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity to the horizontal turbulent eddy diffusivity was found to be larger in the horizontal shear case. (C) 2000 Begell House Inc.

Average energy flow in the whole study area was 9.46X104 kJ.km-2.day-1. Energy intake rates ranged 4-13X104 kJ.km-2.day-1, being higher in zones that include breeding sites or close to them. Imperial Cormorant was the major contributor to energy flow in all the zones followed by the Black-browed Albatross. Kelp Gull was the major contributor in areas where food from human origin was available. Energy flow was similar in four zones, which may represent a saturation point for seabird biomass in the Beagle Channel. The factors that explain the observed energy flow distribution deal with the distribution of shallow water areas in the channel, the presence of seabird's colonies, the proportion of diver and surface feeders, and the possible segregation of, at least, the most abundant species. Finally, food consumption varied from 1.71-3.42 ton/day, being higher near breeding colonies and lower in areas with more open waters

AB  - The flow and local heat transfer around a wall-mounted cube oriented 45° to the flow is investigated experimentally in the range of Reynolds number 4.2 × 103-3.3 × 104 based on the cube height. The distribution of local heat transfer on the cube and its base wall are examined, and it is clarified that the heat transfer distribution under the angled condition differs markedly to that for cube oriented perpendicular to the flow, particularly on the top face of the cube. The surface pressure distribution is also investigated, revealing a well-formed pair of leading-edge vortices extending from the front corner of the top face downstream along both front edges for Re > (1 - 2) × 104. Regions of high heat transfer and low pressure are formed along the flow reattachment and separation lines caused by these vortices. In particular, near the front corner of the top face, pressure suction and heat transfer enhancement are pronounced. The average heat transfer on the top face is enhanced at Re > (1 - 2) × 104 over that of a cube aligned perpendicular to the flow. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to validate the large eddy simulation (LES) technique for predicting a flow around an obstacle under the condition that a turbulent flow is approaching the obstacle. The turbulent inflow data were generated for both a smooth surface and rough surfaces by the method we had proposed. A half-height cube was immersed in the turbulent boundary layers with several types of vertical velocity profile. With regard to the pressure distributions on the surface of the half-height cube, the computed time-averaged and rms values are in good agreement with previous experimental ones. However, the peak pressure coefficients are underestimated, especially compared to full-scale data. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The goal of this paper, is to promote better load modeling and advanced load modeling, and to facilitate data exchange among users of various production-grade simulation programs. Flexibility of modeling is an important consideration. For transient stability, longer-term dynamics, and small-disturbance stability programs, we recommend the structure of multiple load types connected to a load bus. Load types are static including discharge lighting, induction motors, synchronous motors, and transformer saturation. For each load type, multiple models may be connected to the bus. For longer-term dynamics programs, a model for LTC transformers is also recommended

AB  - Direct Numerical Simulation of a linearly accelerating channel flow starting from an initially statistically steady turbulent flow has been performed. It is shown that the response of the accelerating flow is fundamentally the same as that of the step-change transient flow described in He and Seddighi (J Fluid Mech 715:60–102, 2013). The flow structure again behaves like a boundary layer bypass transition undergoing three distinct phases, namely, (i) initially (pre-transition), the flow is laminar-like and the pre-existing turbulent structures are modulated resulting in elongated streaks leading to a strong and continuous increase in the streamwise fluctuating velocity but little changes in the other two components; (ii) it then undergoes transition when isolated turbulent spots are generated which spread and merge with each other, and (iii) they eventually cover the entire surface of the wall when the flow is fully turbulent. The similarity between the turbulence responses in the two flows is significant noting the contrasting features of the two types of mean flow unsteadiness: in the step-change flow, a sharp boundary layer is resulted in nearly instantly on the wall which closely resembles the spatially developing boundary layer, whereas the linear flow acceleration causes a continuing change of velocity gradient adjacent to the wall which propagates into the flow field with time, resulting in a gradually-developing boundary layer. There are, however, quantitative differences in the detailed behavior of the two flows and especially the transition is much delayed in the accelerating flow. It is also shown that the late pre-transition and early transition stages in both flows are characterised by significantly increased inwards sweep events in the wall region and ejection events in the outer layer. The flatness of the wall-normal velocity increases markedly near the wall around the time of onset of transition as a consequence of the huge intermittency of the velocity fluctuations. That is, there are long periods of quiescent flow coupled with occasional turbulent bursts.

AB  - Low Reynolds number mildly curved turbulent channel flow has been simulated numerically without subgrid scale models. A new spectral numerical method developed for this problem was used. The computations were performed with two million degrees of freedom. A variety of statistical and structural information has been extracted from the computed flow fields. These include mean velocity turbulence stresses, velocity skewness and flatness factors, space time correlations and spectra, all the terms in the Reynolds stress balance equations, and contour and vector plots of instantaneous velocity fields. The effects of curvature on this flow were determined by comparing the concave and convex sides of the channel. The observed effects are consistent with experimental observations for mild curvature. The most significant difference in the turbulence statistics between the concave and convex sides was in the Reynolds shear stress. This was accompanied by significant differences in the terms of the Reynolds shear stress balance equations.

AB  - The present article summarises current knowledge on the risk of fetal cardiac malformations in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT), abnormal ductus venosus blood flow pattern and tricuspid regurgitation. The risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) increases with increasing NT. However, nuchal translucency screening is only modestly efficient in the detection of congenital heart disease in low-risk pregnancies. If the nuchal translucency is normal, abnormal ductus venosus blood flow and tricuspid regurgitation show low sensitivities as single screening parameters. The combination of all 3 markers might increase the detection rates. Fetal echocardiography at 20 weeks of gestation is recommended in foetuses with an NT ≥95th percentile, as the incidence of CHD increases 2.5-fold. When the NT measurement is ≥99th percentile, the risk of CHD increases 10-fold. In this high-risk group and in fetuses with tricuspid regurgitation and/or an abnormal DV flow pattern along with an increased NT, first or early second trimester echocardiography performed by experts is warranted. The early examination of the fetal heart should be completed by a detailed echocardiogram at around 20 weeks of gestation.

AB  - The develoment of the laminar velocity and pressure fields in the hydrodynamic entrance region of rectangular ducts has been explored experimentally. Duct cross sections having aspect ratios of 5:1 and 2:1 were employed in the investigation; air was the working fluid. It was found that the development of the pressure field is much more rapid than that of the velocity field. The entrance length, relative to pressure development, is representable as (z/De)/Re=0.02 for both ducts. The incremental pressure drop due to the development of the flow was deduced from the experimental data as being approximately equal to one velocity head. The axial development of the velocity field is illustrated by a sequence of velocity profiles measured along the symmetry lines of the cross section. The flow development in the 5:1 duct is found to be somewhat more rapid than in the 2:1 duct. Comparisons of the experimental results are made with available predictions of analysis, all of which are based on approximate models of the flow field. In general, the analyses overpredict the incremental pressure drop due to flow development. The development of the velocity field appears to be reasonably well described by analysis.

AB  - In this work a large-eddy simulation (LES) of a turbulent hydrogen jet diffusion flame is presented. The numerical method handles fluctuations of density in space and in time, but assumes density to be independent of pressure (incompressibility). The chemical composition of the fluid is described by solving the filtered transport equation for mixture fraction f . Density, viscosity and temperature are evaluated assuming chemical equilibrium. To account for sub-grid fluctuations of f , its sub-grid distribution is presumed to have the shape of a β-function. The results of the simulation are discussed extensively. The influence of inlet boundary conditions is addressed and radial profiles at different axial positions are shown for a complete set of one-point statistical data. Agreement of numerical results and experimental data is very good. Furthermore, a comparison of Reynolds- and Favre-averages is done and energy spectra at different locations in the flame are discussed.

AB  - Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Models (EARSM) pro- vide a better description of the Reynolds stress tensor than the classical eddy viscosity models. Therefore, they act as a SST limiter and improve separation prediction. They also allow to easily capture rotation and curvature effects. However, the classical derivation of EARSM models relies upon the notion of turbulence time scale, which is available in two-equation models but not in models solving only one transport equation for the eddy viscosity. A way to extend EARSM modelling to one equation models is proposed. For the sake of simplicity only two-dimensional flows are addressed. Applications to simple flows such as homogeneous shear plus rotation, and boundary layer flows without pressure gradient or close to separation are given to validate the model.

AB  - Two-phase pressure driven laminar stratified pipe flow is studied with emphasis on the wall and interfacial shear stresses. The basic solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is recast into a simpler form, alleviating physical interpretation and constituting a convenient basis for further developments. Utilizing two-phase symmetry facilitates writing the velocity field for each phase as one generic expression, which is then split into a linear combination of two terms. The first term equals the single-phase free surface flow of either phase due to the given driving forces. The second term links the phases together and represents the shear flow given by the interfacial drag from the opposite phase. The corresponding expression for the interfacial shear stress now emerges naturally as part of the solution of the boundary value problem. The wall shear stresses are obtained by formal differentiation. The limiting behaviour of the wall and interfacial shear stresses in the triple points, where the fluid-fluid interface meets the pipe wall, is obtained by application of residue calculus. Surprisingly, it proves possible to integrate out the Fourier integrals in the expressions for the mean wall and interfacial shear stresses. The expressions for the mean wall shear stresses are demonstrated to be equivalent to the fluid momentum balances, thus confirming consistency. The new and remarkably simple closed form expression for the mean interfacial shear stress, however, represents the local solution of the boundary value problem at the interface, not obtainable from a regular force balance. It thus complements the momentum balances, facilitating a simple computation of the exact general solution for the mean wall and interfacial shear stresses for a given holdup and pressure drop in a given pipe containing a given pair of fluids. The equation system developed here forms the basis for the inversion of the laminar stratified pipe flow problem in terms of flow rates. The corresponding, however, considerably more transparent, channel flow solution is utilized as a guide to the pipe flow problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transfer and deposition of inertial particles or droplets in turbulent pipe flow are crucial processes in a number of industrial and environmental applications. In this work, we use direct numerical simulation (DNS) and Lagrangian tracking to study turbulent transfer and deposition of inertial particles in vertical upward circular pipe flow. Our objects are: (i) to quantify turbulent transfer of heavy particles to the wall and away from the wall; (ii) to examine the connection between particle transfer mechanisms and turbulence structure in the boundary layer. We use a finite difference DNS to compute the three-dimensional time dependent turbulent flow field (Re
                        ??=337) and Lagrangian tracking of a dilute dispersion of heavy particles - flyashes in air - to simulate the dynamics of particles. Drag, lift and gravity are used in the equation of motion for the particles, which are assumed to have no influence on the flow field. Particle interaction with the wall is fully elastic. Results on preferential distribution of particles in the boundary layer, particle fluxes to and off the wall and particle deposition mechanisms are shown. Our findings confirm: (i) the specific tendency of particles to segregate in the near-wall region; (ii) the crucial role of the instantaneous realizations of the Reynolds stresses in determining particle fluxes toward and away from the wall; (iii) the relative importance of free-flight and diffusion deposition mechanisms. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A direct numerical simulation has been carried out in order to clarify the effects of the high viscosity and the interfacial tension of a droplet on the interaction between the droplet and near-wall turbulence. A liquid turbulent planee Couette flow with an immiscible droplet of the same fluid density as that of the continuous-phase has been used. The diameter of the droplet is fixed at one-fourth of the wall distance, which is nearly equal to 41 wall units. The droplet has been assigned in the range of 20-60 wall units from one moving wall initially. The modified volume of fluid (VOF) algorithm and local grid refinement are used for tracking the phase interface. The velocities for the fine grid are decided so that the equation of continuity is satisfied in the fine cell. It is found that the deformation of the droplet due to the surrounding fluid flow is suppressed by the effect of the interfacial tension of the droplet. The streamwise vortex is attenuated by the existence of the droplet with the interfacial tension. The small vortex is generated in the wake region of the droplet. The Reynolds-shear stress product becomes higher in a wide region around the droplet. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of flow over and heat transfer from a flat plate affected by free-stream fluctuations were performed. A contoured upper wall was employed to generate a favourable streamwise pressure gradient along a large portion of the flat plate. The free-stream fluctuations originated from a separate LES of isotropic turbulence in a box. In the laminar portions of the accelerating boundary layer flow the formation of streaks was observed to induce an increase in heat transfer by the exchange of hot fluid near the surface of the plate and cold fluid from the free-stream. In the regions where the streamwise pressure gradient was only mildly favourable, intermittent turbulent spots were detected which relaminarised downstream as the streamwise pressure gradient became stronger. The relaminarisation of the turbulent spots was reflected by a slight decrease in the friction coefficient, which converged to its laminar value in the region where the streamwise pressure gradient was strongest. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Experiments were conducted in a horizontal flow loop (24 mm i.d.), using an electrochemical technique, for measuring liquid-to-wall shear stress, at Various positions around the pipe circumference. Measurements of liquid film thickness, pressure drop as well as visual observations were also made. These data complement similar information obtained by Paras et al. (1994), in a horizontal 50.8 mm i.d. flow system. Mean values and other statistical information are obtained from the analysis of the shear stress and film thickness data. Visual studies of the gas/liquid interface confirm that its profile is concave rather than flat. The data show that the time-averaged shear stress tends to decrease in the lateral direction (i.e. away from the pipe bottom, Theta = 0 degrees) along which the liquid film gradually becomes thinner. Only for relatively low superficial gas velocities (e.g. U-G < 15 m/s), the mean shear stress is almost constant up to Theta = 45 degrees; i.e. in a flow region where there is a relatively thick liquid layer. An expression is proposed for predicting the shear stress circumferential distribution. By means of momentum balances (utilizing the new data), the average gas/liquid interfacial friction factor is determined with improved accuracy. Additionally an equivalent gas/liquid interface roughness is expressed in terms of wave characteristics, i.e. wave intermittency and amplitude. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Fully developed turbulent flow indeed consists of a hierarchy of eddies or scales of various disorders. Due to the complexity of turbulence, the turbulent flow structure has not been completely understood. Thus, abundant empirical observations have been made about fractality in hydrodynamic turbulence. In this study, the fractal scaling of velocity components (u???, v???) and Reynolds shear stress (u???v???) for fully developed flow in an open channel were studied for Reynolds number in the range of 29,000-85,000. An efficient algorithm was developed to construct Fractal Interpolation Functions (FIF). The algorithm was used to simulate more than 200,000 time series of u???, v???, and u???v??? that were measured in a laboratory flume. The algorithm was also used to compute fractal dimension. The fractal dimensions of the turbulent data were accurately obtained by applying only as few as 500 data points. It was found that the fractal dimension of u???, v???, and u???v??? were 1.615, 1.657, and 1.559, respectively. The relationships between the fractal dimension and Froude number (Fr) and Reynolds number (Re) were also investigated. It was found that the fractal dimension of turbulent data and Re and Fr were reasonably correlated. Moreover, the fractal dimension of Reynolds shear stress in bursting events (outward interaction, ejection, inward interaction, and sweep) was calculated and compared with each other. There were some differences among the fractal dimension of Reynolds shear stress for four quadrants of bursting process. The fractal dimension of u???v??? in sweep and ejection events were more than the fractal dimension of the overall Reynolds shear stress. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The predictive properties of several non-linear eddy-viscosity models are investigated by reference to highly-resolved LES data obtained by the authors for an internal flow featuring massive separation from a curved surface. The test geometry is a periodic segment of a channel constricted by two-dimensional (2D) `hills' on the lower wall. The mean-flow Reynolds number is 21560. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the streamwise and spanwise directions. This makes the statistical properties of the simulated flow genuinely 2D and independent from boundary conditions, except at the walls. The simulation was performed on a high-quality, 5M-node grid. The focus of the study is on the exploitation of the LES data for the mean-flow, Reynolds stresses and macro-length-scale. Model solutions are first compared with the LES data, and selected models are then subjected to a-priori studies designed to elucidate the role of specific model fragments in the non-linear stress-strain/vorticity relation and their contribution to observed defects in the mean-flow and turbulence fields. The role of the equation governing the length-scale, via different surrogate variables, is also investigated. It is shown that, while most non-linear models overestimate the separation region, due mainly to model defects that result in insufficient shear stress in the separated shear layer, model forms can be derived which provide a satisfactory representation of the flow. One such model is identified. This combines a particular quadratic constitutive relation with a wall-anisotropy term, a high-normal-strain correction and a new form of the equation for the specific dissipation ω = ∈/k.

AB  - Objectives. We present a new method in which a priori knowledge of the blood velocity fields within the boundary layer at the vessel wall, combined with acquisition of high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) blood velocity data, allow exact modeling at the subpixel level. Background. Methods are lacking for accurate, noninvasive estimation of blood flow, dynamic cross-sectional lumen vessel area and wall shear stress. Methods. Using standard acquisition of MRI blood flow velocity data, we fitted all data points (n = 69) within the boundary layer of the velocity profile to a three-dimensional paraboloid, which enabled calculation of absolute volume blood flow, circumferential vessel wall position, lumen vessel area and wall shear stress. The method was tested in a 8.00 ?? 0.01-mm diameter glass tube model and applied in vivo to the common carotid artery of seven volunteers. Results. In vitro the lumen area was assessed with a mean error of 0.6%. The 95% confidence interval included the specified tube dimensions. Common carotid mean blood flow was 7.42 ml/s, and mean (standard error) diastolic/systolic vessel area was 33.25 (0.72 [2.2%])/43.46 (0.65 [1.5%]) mm2. Mean/peak wall shear stress was 0.95 (0.04 [4.2%])/2.56 (0.08 [3.1%]) N/m2. Conclusions. We describe a new noninvasive method for highly accurate estimation of blood flow, cross-sectional lumen vessel area and wall shear stress. In vitro results and statistical analysis demonstrate the feasibility of the method, and the first in vivo results are comparable to published data.

The ?-ε model of turbulence is used and an upstream weighted scheme for this vorticity-stream function formulation is employed. Some computation results for a 195?m wide source are presented. The immediate goal of the undertaking was to devise a scheme which could yield realistic flow ?boundary conditions? in the immediate vicinity of a fire to enable one to model the detailed structure of the fire region. The predictions arc quite consistent with observations and this provides the link between the heat source and environmental parameters. This scheme, together with a refined near zone fire model, can be used to describe the interplay between the heat source (fire) component and the environmental components of a mass fire system

AB  - A direct numerical simulation with turbulent transport of a scalar quantity has been carried out to grasp and understand a laminarization phenomena caused by a pipe rotation. In this study, the Reynolds number, which is based on a bulk velocity and a pipe diameter, was set to be constant; Reb = 5283, and the rotating ratios of a wall velocity to a bulk velocity were set to be 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. A uniform heat-flux was applied to the wall as a thermal boundary condition. Prandtl number of the working fluid was assumed to be 0.71. The number of computational grids used in this study was 256 × 128 × 128 in the z-, r- and φ- directions, respectively. The turbulent quantities such as the mean flow, temperature fluctuations, turbulent stresses and pressure distribution and the turbulent statistics were obtained Moreover, the Reynolds stress and the scalar flux budgets were also obtained for each rotating ratio. The turbulent drag decreases with the rotating ratio increase. The reason of this drag reduction can be considered that the additional rotational production terms appear in the azimuthal turbulence component. The contributions of convection and production terms to the radial scalar flux budget and also to the balance with temperature-pressure gradient term are significant. The dissipation and viscous diffusion terms are negligible in higher rotating ratio.

AB  - Large-eddy simulations of the turbulent flow in a concentric annulus with inner wall rotation were performed at ReDh = 8900 for three rotation rates (N = 0.2145, 0.429 and 0.858). The main emphasis of this work was on the destabilization of the near-wall turbulent structures due to rotation of the inner wall. The turbulent structures close to the inner wall were scrutinized by computing the lower-order statistics. The anisotropy invariant map for the Reynolds stress tensor and the invariant function revealed that rotation of the inner wall altered the anisotropy of the turbulent structure. The probability density functions of the velocity fluctuations and the splat/anti-splat process were examined to create a more complete picture of the contributions of the flow events to turbulent production. The present numerical results indicate that the alteration of the turbulent structures can be attributed to the destabilizing effect of rotation of the inner wall, which gives rise to an augmentation of sweep and ejection events. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Fluids, vol. 18, 2006, p.\n011702; Iwamoto et al., Proceedings of the Sixth Symposium Smart\nControl of Turbulence, 2005). Much knowledge has been gained from\nthese results, particularly in the areas of flow structure and dynamics.\nYet, while the value of such simulations is undoubted, only very\nlimited comparisons with experimental data have been documented.\nAlthough the physics of the flow are captured correctly in an ideal\nDNS, as with any real numerical or physical experiment, there are\nopportunities for misrepresentation of the characteristics of turbulence.\nAs such, this article seeks to make a comparison between a well-documented\nhigh Reynolds number (ReÏ = 934), large box size (8Ïh Ã 2h Ã\n3Ïh) DNS from del Ãlamo et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 500, 2004,\np. 135) and laboratory channel flow data measured by the authors.\nResults show that there is excellent agreement between the streamwise\nvelocity statistics of the two data sets. The spectra are also very\nsimilar, however, throughout the logarithmic region the secondary\npeak in energy is clearly reduced in the DNS results. Although the\nsource of the difference is not certain, the wavelengths concerned\nare close to the DNS box length, leading to the recommendation that\nlonger box lengths should be investigated. Another large-scale spectral\ndiscrepancy near the wall results from the incorrect assumption of\na constant convection velocity used to infer spatial information\nfrom the temporal. A near-wall convection velocity modification function\nis tentatively proposed. While the modification gives good agreement\nbetween the data sets, higher Reynolds number comparisons are required\nto better understand the intricate convection velocity issue.

We found the fluctuations in MCAFV, like ABP, could be diffracted into three components at specific frequency ranges, designated as high-frequency (HF, 0.15 to 0.4 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04 to 0.15 Hz), and very low-frequency (VLF, 0.016 to 0.04 Hz) components. The HF and LF components of MCAFV exhibited high coherence with those of ABP, indicating great similarity of MCAFV and ABP fluctuations within the two frequency ranges. However, it was not the case for the VLF component. Transfer function analysis revealed that the ABP-MCAFV phase angle was frequency-dependent in the LF range (r = -0.79, P < 0.001) but not in the HF range. The time delay between LF fluctuations of ABP and those of MCAFV was evaluated as 2.1 seconds. We conclude that in addition to traditional B-wave equivalents, there are at least two different mechanisms for MCAFV fluctuations: the HF and LF fluctuations of MCAFV are basically secondary to those of ABP, and cerebral autoregulation may operate efficiently in LF rather than HF range. Frequency domain analysis offers an opportunity to explore the nature and underlying mechanism of dynamic regulation in cerebral circulation.

AB  - The flow characteristics of theMTL wind-tunnel at the Department ofMechan- ics, KTH, have been evaluated 10 years after its completion. The wind-tunnel is of closed circuit type with a 7 m long test section that has a cross section area of 1.2 × 0.8 m2. The contraction ratio is 9 and the maximum speed is approximately 70 m/s. The experiments performed included measurements of total pressure variation, temperature variation, flow angle variation and turbu- lence intensity variation. The measurements were carried out in the test section over a cross flow measurement area of 0.9×0.5 m2 located 0.4 m downstream the inlet. The temperature variation in time was also measured at the center of the measurement area. The experiments were performed at three different wind-tunnel speeds, 10, 25 and 40 m/s. The present results confirm the high flow quality of the MTL wind-tunnel. The flow quality measurements carried out soon after the completion of the tunnel are here repeated and extended. For instance, at 25 m/s the streamwise turbulence intensity is less than 0.025% and both the cross flow turbulence intensities are less than 0.035% at the same speed. The total pressure variation is less than ±0.06% and the temperature variation is less than ±0.05◦C.

AB  - The characteristics of the wind flow at low levels in the urban environment (Roughness Sublayer (RS)) are quite different from, and to some extent independent of the characteristics of the flow in the upper part of the Urban Boundary Layer. In the RS, in fact, the flow is influenced more by the local geometry, than by a homogeneous energy transfer between horizontal layers. In this paper, the results of wind tunnel flow measurements in and above a regular urban geometry pattern, with street canyons parallel and orthogonal to the oncoming wind, are reported. The statistics and the spectral characteristics of the flow in the RS are discussed. The influence of the oncoming turbulence on the RS flow is analysed, and the differences between the flow in transversal and longitudinal street canyons are evidenced. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Flow instability in baffled channel flow, where thin baffles are mounted on both channel walls periodically in the direction of the main flow, has been numerically investigated. The geometry considered here can be regarded as a simple model for finned heat exchangers. The aim of this investigation is to understand how baffle interval (L) and Reynolds number (Re) influence the flow instability. With a fixed baffle length of one quarter of channel height (H), ratios of baffle interval to channel height (RB=L/H) between 1 and 4 are considered. The critical Reynolds number of the primary instability, a Hopf bifurcation from steady flow to time-periodic flow, turned out to be minimum when RB=3.08. The friction factor (f) is strongly correlated with the critical Reynolds number for RB. 2.5. For the particular cases of RB=1.456 and RB=1.0, we performed Floquet stability analysis in order to study the secondary instability through which time-periodic two-dimensional flow bifurcates into three-dimensional flow. The results obtained in this investigation are in good agreement with those computed from full simulations, and shed light on understanding and controlling flow characteristics in a finned heat exchanger, quite beneficial to its design. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Flows around missiles, rockets and projectiles often expe- rience baseflow separation. This means that the pressure behind the base is considerably lower than the freestream pressure, causing base drag that often constitutes a large portion of the total drag. The present study is motivated by the fact that most methods used for reducing the drag often also reduce the aerodynamic stability of the vehicle. Semi- analytical methods and Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) models often fail to provide accurate results for such flows, and therefore we use Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to investigate the flow physics of axisymmetric baseflow in a configuration for which experimental data is available for comparison. Good agreement with experi- mental data, with and without, base bleed is obtained for several LES models, suggesting that the details of the sub- grid model are of less importance. The simulation data are also examined with the intention of increasing our knowl- edge of the underlying flow physics.

AB  - Gross flow development patterns have been monitored during slurry packing and compared for PEEK and stainless-steel liquid chromatographic microbore columns for different sorbents and slurry compositions. Flow-rate, pressure and apparent permeability data were collected with the help of a computer-aided monitoring technique. The development of the packing process under constant-pressure conditions, as detected by changes in the flow, has been found to have four characteristic stages, the development of which correlates with the final degree of compaction of the porous bed and with column efficiency. The parameters characterising porous structure - specific permeability, K(o), and specific column resistance, have been compared for different groups of packed columns. It has been found that they correlate weakly with the column efficiency and the packing pressure for the same group of sorbents and packing slurry chemical composition. However, packings performed under the same pressure regime but using differing slurry media produced different flow patterns and have shown vast variation both in the column efficiency and in the specific column resistance. The range of specific column resistance values observed in this study for 0.5-mm I.D. microcolumns was 250<??<900. A correlation of ?? with the column tubing material has been observed and attributed to wall effects. The proposed method for the assessment of the effectiveness of the packing procedure enables changes in the dynamics of the packing process caused by changes of the slurry chemistry or other packing parameters to be observed and thus, the packing procedure for new stationary phases to be effectively adjusted. The expected column efficiency (and particularly packing failure) can be estimated during packing, prior to chromatographic assessment of the column.

AB  - Experimental results of the time-dependent velocity and vorticity field in the region of vortex breakdown in a tube flow using Particle-Image-Velocimetry (PIV) are reviewed and discussed here. The results show the essential characteristics of the development of vortex breakdown and the distinct topological structure of both predominant forms, the bubble- and the spiral-type. Comparison of the generation process of circumferential vorticity during development of vortex breakdown reveals good agreement with the theoretical prediction. This confirms the idea of feedback as the key-mechanism for rapid development of vortex breakdown. The bubble-type breakdown is viewed as the fundamental breakdown type where the circumferential vorticity is distributed in a form of an elliptical vortex-ring-like structure. The evolution of asymmetry after generation of the bubble can be explained as the consequence of imbalance of rearward feed-in of mass and given limitations in bubble's growth and upstream migration. The asymmetry causes, due to induction, the front stagnation point to be deflected radial away, which begins to rotate around the axis but remains still dose to the centerline. The dynamical behaviour inside the bubble can be explained by the the model of a tilted vortex ring, which gyrates and compensates the feed-in by mass exchange at the rear end of the bubble. A second introduced feedback mechanism can explain the transition to spiral-type breakdown. Accordingly, the asymmetry triggers itself at a critical degree and leads to a radial deflection of the stagnation point of order of the characteristic vortex core radius. This again leads to the unilateral deflection of the approaching vortex core. A simple mechanic model explains the characteristic features of the evolving spiral as its winding, rotation and dynamics.

AB  - A detailed knowledge of both velocity and thermal fields in wall turbulence disturbed by a row of ribs on the wall is important for clarifying the chief factors of fluid and thermal dynamics related to the control of heat transfer. In this study, in order to elucidate the effects of roughness on the statistical quantities in the velocity and thermal fields, direct numerical simulations (DNS) of heat transfer in turbulent channel flows with transverse-rib roughness have been performed by varying their spacing, width and height, in which the turbulent heat transfer with k-type and d-type roughness walls are simulated. It is found that since turbulent mixing is promoted by arranging ribs, the distributions of mean velocity and temperature become markedly asymmetric. Systematic variations of secondary flow patterns between ribs are clearly identified. The best heat transfer performance is found to be obtained with the k-type roughness. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The drag, lift, and heat transfer coefficients from the downstream heated cylinder due to inline and offset eddy-promoting cylinders were studied. The results show that the drag coefficient and cylinder Nusselt number decrease as the heated cylinder approaches the wall. The highest Strouhal number value is observed in the channel-centered, inline-eddy configuration. Complex periodic vortex shedding develops when the eddy promoter is offset from the primary cylinder.

AB  - The link between edge sheared flows and turbulence is investigated in the plasma edge region of the TJ-II stellarator and the results are compared with results in other devices like JET tokamak. In the TJ-II stellarator there is a threshold density to trigger the development of edge shear flows. During sheared flow development the degree of turbulence anisotropy (<(upsilon) over tilde (parallel to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)>) is modified. The fact that different quadratic terms in fluctuating velocities (<(upsilon) over tilde (parallel to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)> and <(upsilon) over tilde (perpendicular to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)>) change during edge sheared flow generation means that shear flow physics involves 3D physics phenomena in which both perpendicular and parallel dynamics are involved. A new strategy has been recently applied to plasma physics to quantify the local energy transfer between flows and turbulence by computing the production term. Experimental results show that turbulence can act as an energy sink and energy source for the mean flow near the shear layer. Measurements of the turbulence production show the importance of 3D effects on the energy transfer between flows and turbulence

AB  - Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of small prolate ellipsoidal particles suspended in a turbulent channel flow is reported. The coupling between the fluid and the particles is one-way. The particles are subjected to the hydrodynamic drag force and torque valid for creeping flow conditions. Six different particle cases with varying particle aspect ratios and equivalent response times are investigated. Results show that, in the near-wall region, ellipsoidal particles tend to align with the mean flow direction, and the alignment increases with increasing particle aspect ratio. When the particle inertia increases, the particles are less oriented in the spanwise direction and more oriented in the wall-normal direction. In the core region of the channel, the orientation becomes isotropic. 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A turbulent boundary layer of a water flow is investigated by means of pulsed ultrasound Doppler velocimetry. The advantage of this method is the acquisi- tion of complete velocity profiles along the sound propa- gation line within very short time intervals. The shear stress velocity, used for normalizing the velocity profiles, was determined by fitting the profiles to the universal profiles in a turbulent boundary layer obtained from Prandtl’s mixing length theory. A coordinate transforma- tion in the near-wall region is proposed to allocate the velocity data to ‘‘true’’ wall distances. From the experi- mental values of the wall shear stress velocity, the friction factors for a turbulent pipe flow are calculated and com- pared to the Blasius law. The overall error in measurement was estimated to ±8.4%.

AB  - Laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) allows for the quantitative estimation of blood flow in the optic nerve head, choroid, retina and iris in vivo. It was developed to facilitate the non-contact analysis of ocular blood flow in living eyes, utilizing the laser speckle phenomenon. The technique uses a fundus camera, a diode laser, an image sensor, an infrared charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a high-resolution digital CCD camera. Normalized blur (NB), an approximate reciprocal of speckle contrast, represents an index of blood velocity, and shows a good correlation with tissue blood flow rates determined with the microsphere method in the retina, choroid or iris, as well as blood flow rates determined with the hydrogen gas clearance method in the optic nerve head. The square blur ratio (SBR), another index for quantitative estimation of blood velocity, is proportional to the square of the NB. The SBR is theoretically a more exact measurement which is proportional to velocity, whereas the NB is an approximation. Normalized blur was calculated in earlier versions of LSFG because of technical limitations; the SBR is used in current versions of the LSFG instrument. As these values are in arbitrary units, they should not be used to make comparisons between different eyes or different sites in an eye. Clinical protocols, calibration, evaluation procedures and possible limitations of the LSFG technique are described and the results of ocular blood flow studies using LSFG are briefly summarized. The LSFG method is suitable for monitoring the time-course of change in the tissue circulation at the same site in the same eye at various intervals, ranging from seconds to months. Unresolved issues concern the effect of pupil size on measurement results, the effects of various stimulations, and how to measure choroidal and retinal blood flow velocity separately without using the blue-component of argon laser.

AB  - An experimental investigation into the entrance length for fully developed turbulent flow in a smooth channel was undertaken. The Reynolds number based on channel height were approx- imately 40×103, 105×103, and 185×103. Mean velocity profiles were taken with a Pitot-static tube between distances of 70 and 205 heights from the inlet. A vertical shift—the di- rect result of a change in skin friction—is found to be the most salient indication of under-development in the velocity profile. It is suggested that commonly used criteria for fully developed flow may be inadequate to detect these first instances of under- development.

AB  - The development of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity downstream of a standard tube bundle and three different slotted plates has been measured in a four inch pipe using a 1-D laser Doppler anemometer system. The results show how far the standard tube bundle must be placed upstream of the orifice plate to obtain fully developed mean velocity and turbulence. Numerical analyses of how shaping the velocity profile exiting a flow conditioner effects the development of both the turbulence and mean velocity have been performed. These analyses indicate that a power law profile (1/7th) with a 9% turbulence intensity produces a fully developed flow in the shortest pipe length, 20 D. A parabolic profile requires a slightly longer development length. A uniform flow required the longest length of pipe. The effect of the turbulence intensity produced by the flow conditioner was also investigated. Three different slotted plates were manufactured to produce a 1/7th power law, parabolic, and uniform velocity profile downstream of the plate. The development of the mean velocity and turbulence have been measured. These data were compared to the predictions with very favorable results. The simulations accurately represented the flow field and turbulence intensity distibutions.

AB  - Effect of traveling wave-like wall deformation (i.e. peristalsis) in a fully developed turbulent channel flow is investigated by means of direct numerical simulation. We not only demonstrate that the friction drag is reduced by wave-like wall deformation traveling toward the downstream direction, but also show that the turbulence is completely suppressed (viz. the flow is relaminarized) under some sets of parameters. It is also found that at higher amplitude of actuation the relaminarized flow is unstable and exhibits a periodic cycle between high and low drag. The drag reduction is caused by suppression of random Reynolds shear stress component due to stabilization. The quadrant analysis reveals that traveling wave-like wall deformation makes strongly negative random Reynolds shear stress in the converging region. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The effects of compressibility are studied in low Reynolds number turbulent supersonic channel flow via a direct numerical simulation. A pressure-velocity-entropy formulation of the compressible {Navier-Stokes} equations which is cast in a characteristic, non-conservative form and allows one to specify exact wall boundary conditions, consistent with the field equations, is integrated using a fifth-order compact upwind scheme for the Euler part, a fourth-order Padé scheme for the viscous terms and a third-order low-storage {Runge-Kutta} time integration method. Coleman et al fully developed supersonic channel flow at M = 1.5 and Re = 3000 is used to test the method. The nature of fluctuating variables is investigated in detail for the wall layer and the core region based on scatter plots. Fluctuations conditioned on sweeps and ejections in the wall layer are especially instructive, showing that positive temperature, entropy and total temperature fluctuations are mainly due to sweep events in this specific situation of wall cooling. The effect of compressibility on the turbulence structure is in many respects similar to that found in homogeneous shear turbulence and in mixing layers. The normal components of the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor are increased due to compressibility, while the shear stress component is slightly reduced. Characteristic of the Reynolds stress transport is a suppression of the production of the longitudinal and the shear stress component, a suppression of all velocity-pressure-gradient correlations and most of the dissipation rates. Comparison with incompressible channel flow data reveals that compressibility effects manifest themselves in the wall layer only.

Sammelband der VGB-Tagung, May 1980, pp 232-238 and Himmelsbach, J., Noll, B., Wittig, S., 1994. Int. Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 37, 1217-1226, the present analysis of shear driven liquid films in a rectangular model duct is directed into the boundary layer flow at the gas-liquid interface and the wall film itself. The experimental conditons range from 314 to 373 K at atmospheric pressure giving duct flow Reynolds numbers of 81 000-162 000. The liquid mass flux for the film is varied between 33.3 g/sm and 100 g/sm. The experimental analysis includes spatially resolved measurements of interfacial shear stress, gas phase velocity and temperature, profiles as well as the wall conditions. The film itself is investigated regarding its thickness and evaporation behaviour. Finally, a reference data set for comparison with CFD-data is obtained. The results obtained suggest that the theoretical models which are currently in use should be modified with regard to the interfacial shear stress development in the axial direction.

AB  - Measurements are presented of the time variation of the wall shear stress caused by the imposition of a sinusoidal oscillation on a turbulent pipe flow. The amplitude of the oscillation is small enough that a linear response is obtained and the dimensionless frequency, ω+ = ων/u*2, is large compared with that studied by most previous investigators. The most striking feature of the results is a relaxation effect, similar to that observed for flow over a wavy surface, whereby the phase angle characterizing the temporal variation of the wall shear stress undergoes a sharp change over a rather narrow range of ω+. At ω+ larger than the median frequency of the turbulence there appears to be an interaction between the imposed flow oscillation and the turbulence fluctuations in the viscous sublayer, which is not described by present theories of turbulence.

AB  - Direct numerical simulations are performed for a fully developed horizontal turbulent channel flow under stable density stratification. The skin-friction and the Nusselt number agree well with the experimental results. Internal gravity waves (IGW) are found to be built up in the core region, where the turbulent heat flux is suppressed drastically and the steep mean velocity and temperature gradients result. In the central region of the channel, the stable density stratification works as the virtual wall to block turbulent heat transfer. It is also found that the energy of IGW is transferred from the shear-induced turbulence through the pressure diffusion. With an increase in the stratification, the flow on one wall starts to become laminar, although it is still turbulent on the other. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It begins with a brief consideration of the main factors that have driven urban policy over the last 15 yr and the particular role played by Urban Development Corporations (UDCs) as the policy flagship of the era. We then examine the effect that the UDCs have had on urban policy development during the 1980s and the 1990s, what trends they have initiated or intensified and what pressures they have responded to. In the third section we are concerned with the perspectives on the UDCs, the way in which the UDC story is now being told. Examines the continuity and discontinuities that prevail in current urban policy. Questions how the role of UDCs has changed, particularly in the light of City Challenge as the new flagship. Finishes by analysing the extent to which City Challenge and the Urban Regeneration Agency in particular as well as other policy vehicles are capable of meeting the enduring problems of urban policy. -from Authors

AB  - In the present study, direct numerical simulation of turbulent heat transfer in a channel flow has been carried out in order to investigate the characteristics of surface heat-flux fluctuations. The Reynolds numbers based on the friction velocity and the channel half width are 180, 395, 640 and 1020, and the molecular Prandtl numbers are 0.025 and 0.71. A local peak for Pr=0.71 and large peaks for Pr=0.025 appear in the spanwise-wavenumber power spectra at low wavenumbers, and these peaks become more significant with increasing Reynolds number. This suggests that the effect of large-scale structures extends even to the surface heat-flux fluctuations, and increases with increasing Reynolds number. In addition, it was found that the surface heat-flux fluctuations for Pr=0.71 are mostly similar to the streamwise wall shear-stress fluctuations, while a noticeable dissimilarity can be seen in the large positive and negative fluctuations.

AB  - The distribution of nonstenosing, asymptomatic intimal plaques in 12 adult human carotid bifurcations obtained at autopsy was compared with the distribution of flow streamline patterns, flow velocity profiles, and shear stresses in corresponding scale models. The postmortem specimens were fixed while distended to restore normal in vivo length, diameter, and configuration. Angiograms were used to measure branch angles and diameters, and transverse histological sections were studied at five standard sampling levels. Intimal thickness was determined at 15 degrees intervals around the circumference of the vessel sections from contour tracings of images projected onto a digitizing plate. In the models, laser-Doppler anemometry was used to determine flow velocity profiles and shear stresses at levels corresponding to the standard specimen sampling sites under conditions of steady flow at Reynolds numbers of 400, 800, and 1200, and flow patterns were visualized by hydrogen bubble and dye-washout techniques. Intimal thickening was greatest and consistently eccentric in the carotid sinus. With the center of the flow divider as the 0 degree index point, mid-sinus sections showed minimum intimal thickness (0.05 +/- 0.02 mm) within 15 degrees of the index point, while maximum thickness (0.9 +/- 0.1 mm) occurred at 161 +/- 16 degrees, i.e., on the outer wall opposite the flow divider. Where the intima was thinnest, along the inner wall, flow streamlines in the model remain axially aligned and unidirectional, with velocity maxima shifted toward the flow divider apex. Wall shear stress along the inner wall ranged from 31 to 600 dynes/cm2 depending on the Reynolds number. Where the intima was thickest, along the outer wall opposite the flow divider apex, the pattern of flow was complex and included a region of separation and reversal of axial flow as well as the development of counter-rotating helical trajectories. Wall shear stress along the outer wall ranged from 0 to -6 dynes/cm2. Intimal thickening at the common carotid and distal internal carotid levels of section was minimal and was distributed uniformly about the circumference. We conclude that in the human carotid bifurcation, regions of moderate to high shear stress, where flow remains unidirectional and axially aligned, are relatively spared of intimal thickening. Intimal thickening and atherosclerosis develop largely in regions of relatively low wall shear stress, flow separation, and departure from axially aligned, unidirectional flow. Similar quantitative evaluations of other atherosclerosis-prone locations and corresponding flow profile studies in geometrically accurate models may reveal which of these hemodynamic conditions are most consistently associated with the development of intimal disease.

AB  - Direct numerical simulation is used to study the flow field around an infinitely long circular cylinder rotating in fluid with no outer boundary. Wall shear stresses and normal pressure fluctuations are considered with reference to flat, non-rotating geometries to help identify any flow field differences introduced by Coriolis forces. In the present case, Coriolis forces are experienced only by the turbulence field. The dominant effect is to decrease the streamwise turbulent velocity level relative to the other two components. A consequential effect is that the two components of wall shear stress fluctuations become almost equal and spectra for streamwise and spanwise wall shear stress fluctuations become almost identical. This is a distinctly different behaviour from that of non-rotating flat plate and straight pipe flows. Instantaneous wall shear stress fluctuations indicate a near wall flow structure similar to that of other boundary layers with sweeps and ejections. No flow reversals of wall shear stress are indicated. A good correlation of the wall shear stresses and the turbulent kinetic energy exists for y+ < 10. Budgets of Reynolds normal stress components illustrate the role played by Coriolis forces in the production and redistribution of turbulence energies. Wall pressure fluctuations are found to be of much larger spatial extent than velocity fluctuation scales while the probability density distribution of pressure fluctuations is almost Gaussian but does display a Reynolds number effect for skewness and Kurtosis. The ratio of rms pressure fluctuations to mean streamwise wall shear stress follows closely that for flat plate boundary layer and channel flows. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The model replicated the geometry of the human aorta and the experiment simulated a physiologically realistic pulsatile flow. The following valves were studied: Starr-Edwards Stellite, Starr-Edwards silicone, Björk-Shiley spherical disc, Björk-Shiley convexo-concave disc, and Hall-Kaster tilting disc. All the valves had a tissue anulus diameter of 27 mm. With the ball-in-cage valves, the flow in the ascending aorta was predominantly axial and uniform throughout systole, while vortex formation was observed downstream from the ball. With the tilting disc valves, the flow development in the aorta was a function of the orientation of the valves. With the major flow orifice directed toward the commissure between the right and noncoronary cusps, the fluid motion was predominantly in the axial direction through early systole. A vortex developed along the wall of lesser curvature of the aorta with the progression of systole. In early diastole, a well-defined flow reversal was observed along the lesser curvature of the aorta. With the major flow orifice directed toward the left coronary cusp, the fluid motion, although predominantly axial, was not uniform in the ascending aorta. Regions of relative stasis present near the wall of greater curvature subsequently developed into a trapped vortex throughout the cardiac cycle. With the major flow orifice directed more posteriorly, an improved fluid dynamic characteristic was observed, and there was no trapped vortex present near the wall of greater curvature. The flow visualization study in the model human aorta suggests that, from a fluid dynamic point of view, orientation of the major flow orifice of the tilting disc valve toward the wall of lesser curvature is not advisable.

AB  - In this paper we propose a new method which might be useful to investigate the flow fields close to vaulted walls with spatial and temporal resolution. This kind of flow visualization is important in the field of biofluid mechanics, since a close relationship is assumed between flow and biological phenomena. This new method is non-invasive, and is also applicable for unsteady flows. It has been used to investigate the steady and the unsteady laminar flow in a rectangular duct, as well as the steady, laminar flow in two different U-shaped ducts, both with a backward facing step, one having a rectangular cross-section, the other a nearly elliptical cross-section. The results concurred well with analytical or numerical solutions.

AB  - Thermally stratified turbulent channel flow with temperature oscillation on the bottom wall of the channel is investigated by use of large eddy simulation (LES) approach coupled with dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) models. The objective of this study is to deal with the influence of the temperature oscillation on characteristics of thermally stratified turbulent flow and to examine the effectiveness of the LES technique on predicting unsteady turbulent flow driven by time-varying buoyancy force. To validate the present calculation, thermally stratified turbulent channel flow is computed and compared with available data obtained by direct numerical simulation (DNS), which confirm that the present approach can be used to study stably and unstably stratified turbulent flow satisfactorily. Further, to elucidate the effect of the temperature oscillation on turbulent flow with different Richardson numbers and oscillation periods, some statistical quantities including the phase-averaged resolved velocities, temperature and their fluctuations, turbulent heat fluxes, and turbulence structures based on instantaneous velocity and temperature fluctuations are analyzed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The results of helium thermal-hydraulic transients of the UNK
superconducting magnet system are presented. The model is based on the
set of 1-D mass, energy, and momentum conservation equations for helium
flow in the cooling channels and the heat conduction equation for the
wall, subject to appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The mass
and energy transfer between helium in the winding gaps and helium
flowing in the cooling channels is taken into account. Pressure,
temperature, and helium mass flow developments during a quench in the
quench protection unit magnets and in the header were calculated. The
influence of heat and mass transfer between helium trapped within
winding gaps and the helium stream on pressure behavior in the magnet is
analyzed. It has been found that the amount of liquid helium contained
in the winding affects the maximum quench pressure

AB  - In this study, we investigate the applicability of the mean wall shear stress as a boundary condition for large eddy simulation of wall-bounded turbulent flow with coarse-grid resolution near the wall. We consider turbulent channel flow up to Reτ = O(108) and turbulent boundary layer flow up to Reθ = O(107). The mean wall shear stress is determined based on the log-law at every time step. It is shown that the mean wall shear stress boundary condition accurately predicts the logarithmic velocity profile and low-order turbulence statistics even with very coarse-grid spacing near the wall. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of two-dimensional laminar flow in the entrance region of wavy wall ducts as obtained from the solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. Design/methodology/approach-The study is undertaken by application of the generalized integral transform technique in the solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The streamfunction-only formulation is adopted, and a general filtering solution that adapts to the irregular contour is proposed to enhance the convergence behavior of the eigenfunction expansion. Findings-A few representative cases are considered more closely in order to report some numerical results illustrating the eigenfunction expansions convergence behavior. The product friction factor-Reynolds number is also computed and compared against results from discrete methods available in the literature for different Reynolds numbers and amplitudes of the wavy channel. Research limitations/implications-The proposed methodology is fairly general in the analysis of different channel profiles, though the reported results are limited to the wavy channel configuration. Future work should also extend the analysis to geometries represented in the cylindrical coordinates with longitudinally variable radius. Practical implications-The error-controlled converged results provide reliable benchmark results for the validation of numerical results from computational codes that address the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in irregular geometries. Originality/value-Although the hybrid methodology is already known in the literature, the results here presented are original and further challenges application of the integral transform method in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Cluster Analysis is the mathematical study of methods for recognizing natural groups within a class of entities. This is a common type of deﬁnition for the discipline of cluster analysis, and it is unsatis- factory in at least one respect. However, this cause for dissatisfaction must be welcomed, since it points directly to some of the essential questions and problems in cluster analy- sis. These essential aspects will be brieﬂy discussed in this introduction, followed by an account of the main contribution of the thesis, the Markov Cluster Process, a cluster pro- cess designed within the setting of graphs. This setting deﬁnes a relatively young area in cluster analysis referred to as graph clustering, which has connections to the clearly scoped ﬁeld of graph partitioning. Clustering and graph-clustering methods are also studied in the large research area labelled pattern recognition. These disciplines and the applications studied therein form the natural habitat for the Markov Cluster Algorithm. Their relative positions are sketched, anticipating a more thorough topography in the ﬁrst part of this thesis. The Markov Cluster Process (abbreviated MCL process) deﬁnes a sequence of stochastic matrices by alternation of two operators on a generating matrix. It is basically all that is needed for the clustering of graphs, but it is useful to distinguish between the algorithm and the algebraic process employed by the algorithm. The study of mathematical prop- erties thus belongs to the process proper, and aspects such as interpretation and scaling belong to the algorithm or a particular implementation of the algorithm. The second part of this thesis covers the conceptual and theoretical foundation of the Markov Clus- ter (abbreviated MCL) Algorithm and Process. Other proposals for graph clustering are discussed, and several classic mathematical results are presented which are relevant in the broad perspective of graph clustering and graph partitioning, in particular the rela- tionship between graph spectra and connectivity properties. The third part of the thesis is concerned with algorithmic issues such as complexity, scalability, and implementation, and various types of experiments and benchmarks establishing the particular strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm.

AB  - The numerical finite-difference procedure of Gosman et al. (1969) is used to predict the growth of the tangential velocity profile and boundary-layer displacement thickness across an isothermal laminar axial flow through a concentric annulus when the inner cylinder is rotated at speeds which are insufficient to generate Taylor vortices. Solutions are obtained for fully developed and for developing axial flow over the ranges 0.05 <$0.98, 0.0002 < l < 1.0 and 100 < Re < 1700. The axial velocity profile is predicted to be insensitive to core rotation and, if varied, to influence only marginally the development of the tangential velocity profile; this is such that its dimensionless displacement thickness is related to dimensionless axial distance by a power law except near full development and at very low Reynolds number. Predictions at high Re accord extremely well with measurements. Astill's (1964) stability criterion for the onset of vortices in tangential developing flow is accordingly presented afresh in terms of system parameters readily available to the designer.

AB  - In this paper we investigate a subgrid model based on an anisotropic version of the NS-alpha model using a lid-driven cavity flow at a Reynolds number of 10,000. Previously the NS-alpha model has only been used numerically in the isotropic form. The subgrid model is developed from the Eulerian-averaged anisotropic equations (Holm, Physica D 133:215, 1999). It was found that when alpha (2) was based on the mesh numerical oscillations developed which manifested themselves in the appearance of streamwise vortices and a 'mixing out' of the velocity profile. This is analogous to the Craik-Leibovich mechanism, with the difference being that the oscillations here are not physical but numerical. The problem could be traced back to the discontinuity in alpha (2) encountered when alpha (2) = 0 on the endwalls. A definition of alpha (2) based on velocity gradients, rather than mesh spacing, is proposed and tested. Using this definition the results with the model show a significant improvement. The splitting of the downstream wall jet, rms and shear stress profiles are correctly captured a coarse mesh. The model is shown to predict both positive and negative energy transfer in the jet impingement region, in qualitative agreement with DNS results.

AB  - The spatial-temporal velocity and surface heat transfer behavior in a rectangular end-wall junction are examined experimentally for an impinging turbulent boundary layer. The study is done in a water channel on a fast response, constant heat-flux surface using flow visualization, scanned-laser particle image velociemtry (PIV), and thermochromic liquid crystals (LC). Particle image visualizations and PIV-derived vorticity isocontours in the junction region of a rectangular block illustrate that a dominant unsteady horseshoe vortex resides in the junction region, as suggested by previous studies2 (Devenport and Simpson 1990; Pierce and Shin 1992). The horseshoe vortex moves sporadically within a spatial envelope, due to the interaction with both (1) vortices from the impinging turbulent boundary layer; and (2) intermittent, opposite rotation vortices spawned by eruptive vortex-surface interactions (Walker 1978; Peridier et al. 1991). Companion surface heat transfer studies using thermochromic liquid crystals of both a canonical turbulent boundary layer and the rectangular block junction illustrate the presence of initially discrete spanwise variations in heat transfer on the approach surface caused by the presence of the streamwise, near-wall "streaks" in the impinging turbulent boundary layer; in the junction region, these streaks undergo a rapid metamorphosis into discrete, transverse regions of high heat transfer. These localized regions display significant transient, three-dimensional (3-D) behavior, appearing to be directly associated with vortex-surface interactions by the resident horseshoe vortex. This milieu of turbulent vortex development/interaction results in increases of 62% in spatially averaged Stanton number and increases of over 200% in local Stanton number compared to the canonical turbulent boundary layer.

In line with the current trend toward the use of computationally efficient numerical methods, the present study is based on the use of a three-dimensional parabolic, boundary-layer model and the FLARE approximation. Physical situations investigated include cases with various asymmetric heating conditions over wide ranges of parameters. Analytical solutions for the fully developed flows are also presented, and the criteria for the flow reversal to occur are predicted. Solutions for the developing flow obtained in this study agree closely with the elliptic-model solutions, and precisely approch the fully developed solutions downstream.

AB  - Experimental measurements of the wall shear stress combined with velocity profiles via the electrochemical technique and Ultrasonic pulsed Doppler Velocimetry, are used to analyze the flow behavior in transient flow caused by a downstream short pipe valve closure. The Reynolds number of the steady flow based on the pipe diameter is Re=121700. The results show that the quasi-steady approach of representing unsteady friction is valid during the initial phase for relatively large decelerations. For higher decelerations, the unsteady wall shear stress is consistently higher than the quasi-steady values obtained from the velocity profiles. An examination of the range of applicability of the instantaneous-acceleration model shows that the empirical coefficient of unsteady friction is closely linked to the deceleration intensity. This study is made possible owing to the repeatability of different valve closures allowing data to be averaged over numerous tests.

AB  - Flow methods have been consolidated as routine techniques of analysis, allowing a high degree of automation and leading to the concept of the total analytical approach, thanks to the ease they provide for integration of all steps of the analytical procedure, from sample collection to acquisition and processing of signals, on a single setup. The huge effort on research and development for monitoring of key indicators and surrogates has delivered a broad spectrum of operational and cost-effective methodologies based on flow analysis for the determination of many environmental parameters. This chapter gives an overview of online monitoring and environmental applications using flow-based methodologies. Their potential in this field is illustrated through representative examples covering a wide range of parameters and sample matrices, e.g. natural and wastewaters, gaseous compounds and atmospheric aerosols, soils, solid wastes and leachates, foodstuff, and plant extracts.

AB  - A series of physical experiments, together with Large Eddy Simulations (LES), are performed for an open channel flow over a mildly sloping pool-riffle sequence, a bed morphology typical in many coarse-grained rivers. Five low angled (7.2°) bedforms were placed in a 0.6m wide rectangular flume with a flow Reynolds number of approximately Re=20,000. Our broad goal is to develop a general model of flow over this simplified macroscale bedform. Specific objectives were to measure changes to the three-dimensional distribution of flow and describe turbulent shear zones that form due to pressure gradients and interactions with the side wall. A new parameter, Ψ, is introduced to describe the lateral distribution of flow. Flow over the bedforms is characterized by a three-dimensional redistribution of flow and increased generation of turbulence in zones of flow deceleration, particularly near the side walls of the channel. Over repeated bedforms, the distribution of flow and turbulence adjust towards a type of equilibrium characterized by stronger lateral gradients in velocity and Reynolds stress.

AB  - Three conservation laws – mass, momentum, and energy – are used to describe open-channel flows. Two flow variables, such as the flow depth and velocity, or the flow depth and rate of discharge, are sufficient to define the flow conditions at a channel cross section. Therefore, two governing equations may be used to analyze a typical flow situation. The continuity equation and the momentum or energy equation are used for this purpose. Except for the velocity head coefficient, α, and the momentum coefficient, β, the momentum and energy equations are equivalent [Cunge, et al., 1980] provided the flow depth and velocity are continuous, i.e., there are no discontinuities, such as a jump or a bore. However, the momentum equation should be used if the flow has discontinuities, since, unlike the energy equation, it is not necessary to know the amount of losses in the discontinuities in the application of the momentum equation. In this chapter, we will derive the continuity and momentum equations, usually referred to as de Saint Venant equations. Several investigators [Stoker, 1957; Chow, 1959; Dronkers, 1964; Henderson, 1966; Strelkoff, 1969; Yen, 1973; Liggett, 1975; Cunge, et al., 1980; Lai, 1986; and Abbott and Basco, 1990] derived these equations by using different procedures. For illustration purposes, we will use two different procedures in our derivations. We will use the Reynolds transport theorem for the prismatic channels having lateral inflows or outflows. The type of the governing equations is then discussed. The equations describing flows having non-hydrostatic pressure distribution are derived by integrating the continuity and momentum equations for twodimensional flows. The chapter concludes by presenting integral forms of the governing equations.

RNG turbulence parameterization were implemented in the RAMS model. The first one is commonly used in urban environments, however it was found to have some deficiencies when applied to the simulation of flow impingement and separation. The second parameterization is found to overcome these deficiencies. Results show that the flow that develops around the buildings simulated in the present work is notably complex and was found to be sensitive both to the turbulence closure scheme and to the boundary conditions as specified at the buildings' walls. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the processing of particulate materials in rotary kilns and driers the transverse motion generated in the bed is the primary factor controling renewal of material at the exposed bed surrace. The rate of surface renewal, in turn, determines the degree of material mixing and the rate of heat transfer from the freeboard to the bed. An experimental campaign launched to investigate granular flow behaviour in a transverse plane of a rotary cylinder suggests that a continuum model based on the constitutive equations developed for gravity flow in chutes may be adopted, in some particular cases, to describe flow in the shear (active) layer. A model is developed in which the dimensions of the shear layer, the region near the free surface, is assumed thin thereby permitting the governing equations to reduce to Prandtl's boundary layer equations which are solved to obtain the depth and velocity profiles within the layer. Because the density at the free surface is discontinuous for the flow regimes of practical interest, the continuum assumption breaks down at the free surface, hence, a stress-free boundary ocndition has been avoided. In place of this, a surface velocity constraint from the experimental campaign has been applied which, therefore, makes the model deficient in exploring the full potential of the boundary layer analogy. Nevertheless, the appropriate velocity trends are predicted well into the bed with the results comparing favorably with experimental data.

AB  - The wall-bounded shear flow and the plane Poiseuille channel flow of monodisperse suspensions of liquid drops are considered by theory and numerical simulation. First, the motion of an individual drop in infinite or semi-infinite shear flow is discussed in the limit of small volume fractions. An expression for the flux of the drops normal to the streamlines of the unperturbed flow is derived in terms of (a) the migration velocity of the drop away from the wall, and (b) the net displacement of a drop's center after interception with another drop. In the case of two-dimensional infinite shear flow, in the limit of infinite dilution, and in the context of Stokes flow, the self- and gradient-diffusivity are found to diverge, and this underlines the importance of fluid inertia and the necessity to perform renormalization by requiring global constraints. Numerical simulations of pairwise drop interceptions in semi-infinite shear flow above a plane wall reveal that the capillary number, expressing the drop deformability, and the distance of the drop pair from the wall, play an important role in determining not only the magnitude, but also the direction of the net displacement of the drop center after recession. Dynamic simulations of the expansion of a periodic bed of drops distributed randomly within a layer next to a wall illustrate explicitly the formation of a particle-free zone near the wall and the thickening of the bed due to hydrodynamic interceptions at a rate that is a strong function of the capillary number. Results of dynamic simulations of the pressure-driven flow of a two-dimensional suspension in a channel confined between two parallel walls are presented illustrating the effect of the capillary number and of the ratio of the viscosity of the drop and suspending fluid on (a) the time required for the suspension to reach statistical equilibrium, (b) the distribution of the drop number density across the channel width, (c) the mean velocity profile, and (d) the effective viscosity of the suspension. The general features of the flow are found to be in good agreement with published laboratory observations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low Reynolds number turbulent flow in a lubricated plane channel is studied by means of direct numerical simulations. The very thin lubricating film is more viscous than the bulk-fluid and is present at both channel walls. The bulk-fluid is no longer exposed to the no-slip condition at the solid surfaces. Despite the rather large interfacial motions the bulk-flow does in many aspects perceive the interface as a solid wall, except in the immediate vicinity of the lubricating film where the interfacial motions heavily influence the bulk-flow. The lubricating film shows a high degree of anisotropy, and the only major component is the streamwise velocity fluctuations. Also the bulk-flow adjacent to the interface is closer to one-component turbulence than what is commonly observed close to solid surfaces. The interface is populated by very organized low-speed streaks with a mean spacing close to 100 wall units. The coherent structures in the near-interface region do resemble those close to solid walls, but they are situated somewhat closer to the interface since the coherent velocity field is slightly penetrating the lubricating film. ?? 2005 Published by The Japan Society of Fluid Mechanics and Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The impact of wall heating on the flow structure in the near-wall region inside a square channel was investigated. PIV was used to measure the two-dimensional velocity fields. The measurements were conducted for a range of flow conditions that covers laminar and turbulent regimes. The results have shown that the impact of wall heating on the flow behavior is significantly different for laminar and turbulent flow regimes. It was found that when an originally laminar flow is heated from below, the turbulence is generated in the flow mainly due to buoyancy. When the flow is in the turbulent regime, addition of heat from below reduces the magnitude of turbulent properties due to the working of turbulence against the buoyancy forces. Results also show that for originally laminar flow, an increase in the instability in stratification increases the turbulence whereas, for originally turbulent flows, the turbulence is decreased with an increase in instability. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a laminar separation bubble in the presence of oscillating flow is performed. The oscillating flow induces a streamwise pressure gradient varying in time. The special shape of the upper boundary of the computational domain, together with the oscillating pressure gradient causes the boundary layer flow to alternately separate and re-attach. When the inflow decelerates, the shear layer starts to separate and rolls up. Simultaneously the flow becomes 3D. After a transient period, the phase-averaged reverse flow inside the separation bubble reaches speeds ranging from 20 up to 150\% of the free-stream velocity. During these phases, the flow is absolutely unstable and self-sustained turbulence can exist. When the inflow starts to accelerate, a spanwise roll of turbulent flow is shed from the shear layer. Shortly after this, the remainder of the separation bubble moves downstream and rejoins with the shed turbulent roll. During the flow-acceleration phase, a patch of laminar boundary layer flow is obtained. Along the flat plate, a series of turbulent patches of flow travelling downstream, separated by laminar flow can be observed, reminiscent of boundary layer flow in a turbine cascade with periodically appearing free-stream disturbances.

AB  - The main source of flow unsteadiness in turbomachinery is the aerodynamical interaction of the rotor and stator blade rows. The blades and vanes, moving relatively to each other, interact because of the viscous wakes and the potential effects of the blades. In addition, the wakes and potential effects superimpose with other flow patterns, for instance the tip clearance vortices and other secondary flow phenomena. Furthermore in transonic compressors the interaction of wakes and shocks plays an important role. As a result, the real flow field is highly periodically unsteady and very complex, especially in multistage turbomachinery. Although this fact has received increasing attention within recent years, blade row interactions effects are not yet typically addressed in current design systems of turbomachinery. Actually, there is a requirement of the ability of modern design methods to predict unsteady flow features. With increasing aerodynamic loading of the blades and higher Mach numbers the consideration of rotor-stator-interactions gains in importance. It is therefore one of the challenges of the present and future design of compressors and turbines to include beneficial unsteady effects to improve the engine parameters. This requires a detailed physical understanding of the unsteady flow field and the resulting effects on the performance and flow stability. In 2000 the joint research program "Periodical Unsteady Flow in Turbomachinery" was initiated. Partners of this project are five research groups from four german universities: Technische Universität Berlin (Prof. Hourmouziadis), Universität der Bundeswehr München (Prof. Fottner, Prof. Pfitzner), Universität Karlsruhe: Institut für Thermische Strömungsmaschinen (Prof. Wittig, Dr. Dullenkopf), Institut für Hydromechanik (Prof. Rodi), Technische Universität Dresden (Prof. Vogeler), and a research group from the: German Aerospace Centre (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt), (Prof. Weyer, Prof. Mönig). This 5-year program was funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and coordinated by Professor Hourmouziadis (Technische Universität Berlin). The aim of this joint project is to contribute to an improved physical understanding of the periodical unsteady flow phenomena and to provide more reliable prediction methods of these complex flow conditions in turbomachinery. Selected aspects of flow unsteadiness in turbomachines were investigated with complementing experimental and numerical investigations. Different flow conditions of different complexity were investigated in detail. After a 3-year period of the project, first results of the research group are published in a special issue of the Journal of Flow, Turbulence and Combustion (Flow Turbulence Combust 69, 2002). After the end of the joint project, in the present paper selected results of each research group, which addresses different aspects of periodical unsteady flow in turbomachinery, are discussed. However, it is not the intention of the present paper to give a general survey on this field of research. The following topics are selected to provide insight into the work of the joint research group: (1) Experimental Investigation of Rotor-Stator-Interactions in an Axial Compressor, (2) Influence Of Periodically Unsteady Flow On The Boundary Layer Development Of A Highly Loaded Linear Turbine- And Compressor Cascade, (3) Flow Conditions on a Flat Plate under Oscillating Inlet Conditions, (4) Simultaneous Measurements of Flow and Heat Transfer in a Periodically Unsteady Flow, (5) Turbulence- and Transition Modelling for Unsteady RANS simulations, and (6) Direct Numerical Simulations of Transitional Flow in Turbine-Related Geometries. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In the present experimental study, the projection planes of the relative errors at 0.7% level were obtained, and then the efficient region and the actual entrance length were further corrected by introducing the concept of relative error. The results showed that the efficient region of the chamber increased with the direction of length while the inlet velocity was increased, and the actual entrance length was much greater than that of the theoretical entrance length. Therefore, in accordance to the needed range of shear stress in experiment and to the needed efficient region area, the optimum design of the flow chamber is necessary.

AB  - A numerical investigation of turbulent forced convection in a two-dimensional channel with periodic transverse grooves on the lower channel wall is conducted. The lower wall is subjected to a uniform heat flux condition while the upper wall is insulated. To investigate turbulence model effects, computations based on a finite volume method, are carried out by utilizing four turbulence models: the standard k - ??, the Renormalized Group (RNG) k - ??, the standard k - ??, and the shear stress transport (SST) k - ?? turbulence models. Parametric runs are made for Reynolds numbers ranging from 6000 to 18,000 with the groove-width to channel-height ratio (B/H) of 0.5 to 1.75 while the groove pitch ratio of 2 and the depth ratio of 0.5 are fixed throughout. The predicted results from using several turbulence models reveal that the RNG and the k - ?? turbulence models generally provide better agreement with available measurements than others. Therefore, the k - ?? model is selected to use in prediction of this complex flow. In addition, the results of the heat transfer coefficient, friction factor, skin friction coefficient and thermal enhancement factor are also examined. It is found that the grooved channel provides a considerable increase in heat transfer at about 158% over the smooth channel and a maximum gain of 1.33 on thermal performance factor is obtained for the case of B/H = 0.75. This indicates that the reverse/re-circulation flow in a channel with transverse grooves can improve the heat transfer rate. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A precise knowledge of bed shear stress (o) in open channels is useful in many fluid mechanics problems, such as sediment transport modeling, channel bed design, and resuspension modeling. Direct measurement of o is extremely difficult. For this reason, o is often computed from analytical expressions of the velocity field using time-averaged, water column velocity data obtained from hot-media anemometry. Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) has also been employed for the computation of o, using either the law of the wall theory or the Reynolds distribution for shear stress, , in the water column: = -uv. The resulting vertical profile of is then extrapolated down to the bed/sediment interface to yield o. However, LDA is limited because the volume viewed by its laser intersection is very small; thus the measuring device must be moved several times in order to complete the measurements. In this project, Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV) is used to compute the vertical profile of using the Reynolds shear stress distribution for a fully developed turbulent flow field. DPIV is a non-intrusive optical technique that computes velocity vectors in a two-dimensional field using cross correlation of particle locations taken nanoseconds apart with a laser and recording camera. For this experiment, the area viewed by the DPIV was a small section inside the boundary layer, within 1 mm of the gravely-sand sediment bed. Because of experimental limitations, turbulent flow was induced by a front step in the open channel. Under these conditions, a shear stress profile should consist of two portions meeting to form a semi-parabolic shape. This pattern was observed in all profiles produced in the experiment.

AB  - A three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of passive heat transfer in a Laminar Separation Bubble (LSB) over a flat plate affected by oscillating external flow is presented. The oscillation imposes a periodicity which is employed for phase-averaging. The flat plate is kept at a uniform, low temperature. The local Nusselt number, Nu, is determined as a function of phase. In the dead-air region of the bubble Nu is found to be relatively small, while it peaks in the recirculation region where hot outer fluid gets entrained and is transported towards the flat plate. Each period a new separation bubble is formed, that merges with the old separation bubble. The reverse flow inside the separation bubble reaches values of up to 60% of the local free-stream velocity, which is sufficient to make the separation bubble absolutely unstable such that self-sustained turbulence can exist. For the phase-averaged flow, neither the turbulent viscosity hypothesis nor the temperature gradient-diffusion hypothesis is found to hold. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Industrial flows are often wall-bounded, characterized by a high Reynolds number turbulence and a strong unsteadiness. Large-eddy Simulations applied to this kind of flows require a heavy mesh resolution which is out of reach of the nowadays computational power. Wall models are usually used to alleviate this constraint. However, very few of them are dedicated to the temperature field. Besides, most of these wall models are based on equilibrium laws which are not able to take into account the unsteadiness of the flow in the near-wall region. In this study, an original thermal wall model, inspired from the TBLE wall model of Balaras et al. [E. Balaras, C. Benocci, U. Piomelli, Two-layer approximate boundary conditions for large-eddy simulations, AIAA J. 34 (6) (1996) 1111-1119], is developed and implemented in the CEA (French Atomic Center) Trio_U code and assessed on a heated and turbulent plane channel flow configuration. The investigated friction Reynolds numbers are 395, 1020 and 4800, and the Prandtl number is taken equal to 0.71. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The lift on a particle that is caused by its proximity to a boundary and the equilibrium position of this particle in a linear shear flow have been studied using the lattice Boltzmann method. The shear particle Reynolds numbers examined were in the range 0-18 and the particle to fluid density ratios were in the range 1.005-1.1. We have found that heavy particles will deposit at the bottom of the channel, while lighter particles remain suspended and attain an equilibrium vertical position, which is characterized by the equality of the lift and the gravity forces. At this equilibrium distance from the boundary, the vertical velocity component is zero, while the horizontal and rotational velocities of the particle are finite. For circular particles, we have found out that the equilibrium position is independent of the initial height of release of the particles and depends only on the density ratio of particle to fluid and the shear Reynolds number. The particle equilibrium positions for the linear shear flow are compared with those computed for Poiseuille flow conditions. Based on the numerical simulation results, a correlation has been derived between the particle-fluid density ratio and the critical particle Reynolds numbers needed to lift the particles. The effects of particle rotation and shape on the equilibrium position have also been studied by simulating the motion of rectangular particles. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Steady laminar flows in coiled annular ducts are investigated numerically. Numerical solutions are obtained by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with a SIMPLE type procedure for annular curved ducts of various radius ratio for a given Reynolds number. Effect of radius ratio on the flow development is given particular attention. Computational results indicate that the secondary flow in a half cross section (above or below the line of symmetry) for the case of moderate radius ratio is characterized by a pair of counter-rotating vortices; the flow in the core region is toward the outside bend and the flow near the inner and outer walls is toward the inside bend. However, when the radius ratio is very large, say greater than 0.8, the secondary flow is undirectional and is toward the inside bend, owing to the strong viscous effect. It is also found that the downstream flow development is greatly affected by the radius ratio. When the radius ratio is moderate, the centroid of the first moment of streamwise velocity lies on the outside half plane; when the radius ratio is very large, the centroid lies on the inside half plane. In contrast to the case of straight annular duct, the flow in a curved annular duct is not necessarily fully developed earlier when the radius ratio is larger owing to the complicated interaction between the viscous and the centrifugal forces.

AB  - The effect of velocity shear on the stability of resistive wall modes driven by a plasma flow is studied numerically in a slab model. It is shown that the sheared plasma flow can suppress the resistive wall instability if the velocity shear exceeds a critical value when a certain central velocity of the flow is lower than the Alfvén velocity. In comparison with the critical velocities in the uniform velocity case, it is found that the critical velocities of the sheared flow are always bigger than the former. Therefore the velocity shear is a stabilizing factor to the plasma flow driven resistive wall instability when the central velocity of the flow is lower than the Alfvén velocity. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In many forming processes the polymer melt undergoes predominantly extensional deformation, for example in blow moulding and film blowing. Furthermore, the extensional flow behaviour of melts differs significantly from their shear flow behaviour. Thus extensional flow measurement methods are necessary to characterise most appropriately the melt behaviour. Such data can be used for the development and selection of materials and for improving processing. There are two basic approaches to determining extensional flow properties of polymer melts: either using tensile testing methods or converging flow methods. Tensile testing methods were reviewed and their use reported elsewhere [1,2]. The converging flow approach for determining the extensional flow behaviour of polymer melts is based on the measurement of the resistance to flow in a contraction geometry. A converging flow is, by definition, a type of extensional flow. It is expected therefore that extensional viscosity might be obtained from the measurement of pressure drop and flow rate in a converging flow. The approach of using converging flow methods is appealing as experimental data are easily obtained from capillary extrusion rheometry tests that are normally carried out to determine the shear viscosity of materials. Thus extensional viscosity values can be obtained from the same capillary rheometry tests that are carried out to determine shear viscosity at little or no extra cost. This measurement note summarises work carried out on the use of converging flow models for determining extensional viscosity data. A comparison of the predictions of selected converging flow models is presented. Also, a comparison of the predictions of the Cogswell converging flow model with data obtained using a tensile method is presented to demonstrate the validity of the converging flow approach.

AB  - For a quantitative calculation of a flow spectrum from the Doppler frequencies the velocity, the irradiation, and scattering directions must be well known. With the assumption of a random distribution of the velocity and irradiation a realistic flow spectrum can be calculated. Furthermore, the flow spectrum depends on the scattering phase function of the moving particles. A flow meter was developed, consisting of a PC and a control card for two Doppler sensors to be fixed on skin. A Pascal program shows the flows on the display with resolution in time >50 Hz. Four different how domains can be shown simultaneously and the frequency span can be set independently. mows corresponding to low and high Doppler frequencies are different and provide the possibility to distinguish between the flow in the micro capillaries and larger vessels.

AB  - Large eddy simulation has been used to study flow in an open channel with stable stratification imposed at the free surface by a constant heat flux and an adiabatic bottom wall. This leads to a stable pycnocline overlying a well-mixed turbulent region near the bottom wall. The results are contrasted with studies in which the bottom heat flux is nonzero, a difference analogous to that between oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers. Increasing the friction Richardson number, a measure of the relative importance of the imposed surface stratification with respect to wall-generated turbulence, leads to a stronger, thicker pycnocline which eventually limits the impact of wall-generated turbulence on the free surface. Increasing stratification also leads to an increase in the pressure-driven mean streamwise velocity and a concomitant decrease in the skin friction coefficient, which is, however, smaller than in the previous channel flow studies where the bottom buoyancy flux was nonzero. It is found that the turbulence in any given region of the flow can be classified into three regimes (unstratified, buoyancy-affected, and buoyancy-dominated) based on the magnitude of the Ozmidov length scale relative to a vertical length characterizing the large scales of turbulence and to the Kolmogorov scale. Since stratification does not strongly influence the near-wall turbulent production in the present configuration, the behavior of the buoyancy flux, turbulent Prandtl number, and mixing efficiency is qualitatively different from that seen in stratified shear layers and in channel flow with fixed temperature walls, and, furthermore, collapse of quantities as a function of gradient Richardson number is not observed. The vertical Froude number is a better measure of stratified turbulence in the upper portion of the channel where buoyancy, by providing a potential energy barrier, primarily affects the transport of turbulent patches generated at the bottom wall. The characteristics of free-surface turbulence including the kinetic energy budget and pressure-strain correlations are examined and found to depend strongly on the surface stratification.

AB  - This chapter describes the principal flow phenomena, and develops and presents methods to determine parameters such as the drag associated with a rotating cylinder and local flow velocities. The flow phenomenon in rotating cylinder applications depends on the orientation of the cylinder to the flow and the axis of rotation. Correlations are available to determine the drag associated with rotating shaft applications. For an annulus where the inner or outer cylinder may be rotating, consideration can be given to the stability of the flow in order to identify whether vortices are likely to form. Under certain conditions of inner cylinder rotation or combined inner and outer cylinder rotation, toroidal vortices can form in an annulus known as Taylor vortices, with alternate vortices rotating in opposite directions. Rotation of a cylinder or sphere in a cross-flow causes a deflection of the fluid stream and as a result a force due to reaction on the cylinder or sphere concerned. This phenomenon can be exploited to provide a propulsive mechanism for ships and boats using winds to provide the cross-flow; in sports, the variability in lift and drag with spin rate is exploited to control the trajectory and bounce of a shot and in some cases to provide ball or projectile flight paths that are more difficult to predict.

Drop pairs will be injected in a Poiseuille flow to study, by optical means, their relative motion, deformation and possible coalescence. Important part of this preliminary work concerns the injection of controlled charge free drop pairs using a newly developed EHD actuation technique.

AB  - The influence of secondary motions on heat transfer is important in several technical applications. We are interested in simulating convective heat transfer in the presence of the so-called secondary motions of the second kind, as first defined by Prandtl [1], who recognized the existence of fluid motions on a cross-stream plane, induced by the presence of corners in the solid buondary surrounding the flow. Secondary motions of the second kind are present only in a turbulent flow field, and it is well known that they are induced by anisotropic turbulent fluctuations in regions of isotach curvature [2]. These motions are relatively weak, in that they account only for 2÷3% of the bulk velocity, but their influence on shear stress distribution and heat transfer rates is known to be quite significant [3]. In the present work, we adopt Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS hereafter) as a convenient tool for studying both the velocity and temperature field in the presence of solid corners. A square duct is a suitable geometry, in this respect, due to its high degree of symmetry. An imposed pressure drop drives the flow, while the temperature field is generated by the two horizontal walls, kept at constant, different temperatures ±Tw. The vertical walls are assumed to be adiabatic. The Reynolds number, based on hydraulic diameter and bulk velocity, is approximately 4400, while the Prandtl number is assumed 0.71, representative of air. Buoyancy effects were neglected in these simulations, and this simplified the proper setting of geometrical parameters, like domain length and grid resolution. Further simulations, which we are currently carrying on, will provide for the influence of buoyancy forces, of increasing intensity, on the heat transfer rate and flow pattern.

AB  - Numerical predictions of a hydrodynamic and thermally developed turbulent flow are presented for a rotating duct with square ribs aligned normal to the main flow direction. Three rotation numbers Ro = 0.18, 0.35 and 0.67 are investigated. The rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) is 0.1, the rib pitch to rib height (P/e) is 10 and the calculations have been carried out for a bulk Reynolds number of 20,000. The capability of the detached eddy simulation (DES) in predicting the turbulent flow field and the heat transfer under the effects of rotation has been evaluated against unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (URANS), large-eddy simulations (LES), and experimental data. It is shown that DES by capturing a large portion of the turbulent energy in the resolved scales is much more capable than URANS in transcending the underlying shortcomings of the RANS model. DES shows much better fidelity in calculating critical components of the turbulent flow field and heat transfer than URANS. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The heat transfer and fluid mechanics of a turbulent separating and reattaching flow past a backward-facing step are studied  using large eddy simulation. A fully coupled, collocated-grid, low-Mach number preconditioned, compressible formulation em-  ploying central differences was developed to conduct the simulations. A sixth order compact filter was used to prevent pressure--  velocity decoupling. A dynamic sub-grid scale procedure employing the compressible version of the Smagorinsky model has been  used to capture the effects of the small scales. The isothermal turbulent flow past the step, at a Reynolds number of 5540 (based on  the step height and upstream centerline velocity) and a Mach number of 0.006, was simulated to validate the formulation. Sub-  sequently, the bottom wall downstream of the step was supplied with a uniform wall heat flux; three simulations with increasing heat  flux levels were conducted. The viscous sub-layer played a critical role in controlling the heat transfer rate. Streamwise and wall-  normal turbulent heat fluxes were of the same order of magnitude. The Reynolds analogy did not hold in the recirculation region.  However, the Stanton number profiles showed a striking similarity with the fluctuating skin-friction profiles.

AB  - We present results of direct numerical simulation of turbulence modification and heat transfer in turbulent particle-laden channel flow and show an enhancement of the heat transfer and a small increase in the friction velocity when heavy inertial particles with high specific heat capacity are added to the flow. The simulations employ a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian computational model in which the momentum and energy transfer between the discrete particles and the continuous fluid phase are fully taken into account. The effect of turbophoresis, resulting in an increased particle concentration near a solid wall due to the inhomogeneity of the wall-normal velocity fluctuations, is shown to be responsible for an increase in heat transfer. As a result of turbophoresis, the effective macroscopic transport properties in the region near the walls differ from those in the bulk of the flow. To support the turbophoresis interpretation of the enhanced heat transfer, results of simulations employing no particle-fluid coupling and simulations with two-way coupling at considerably lower specific heat, or considerably lower particle concentration are also included. The combination of these simulations allows distinguishing contributions to the Nusselt number due to mean flow, turbulent fluctuations and explicit particle effects. We observe an increase in Nusselt number by more than a factor of two for heavy inertial particles, which is the net result of a decrease in heat transfer by turbulent velocity fluctuations and a much larger increase in heat transfer stemming from the mean temperature difference between the fluid and the particles close to the walls.

AB  - A numerical simulation of a square jet ejected transversely into a laminar boundary-layer flow was performed at a jet-to-main-flow velocity ratio of 9.78 and jet Reynolds number of 6330. The jet consisted of a single pulse with a duration equal to the time required for the jet fluid to travel 173 jet widths. A strongly-favourable streamwise pressure gradient was applied to the boundary layer and produced a freestream acceleration that is above the typical threshold required for relaminarization. The results of the simulation illustrate the effect of the favourable streamwise pressure gradient on the flowfield created by the transverse jet. Notably, the horseshoe vortex system created upwind of the jet remains steady in time and does not induce noticeable fluctuations in the jet flow. The upwind and downwind shear layers of the jet roll-up through a Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instability into discrete shear-layer vortices. Jet vorticity in the upwind and downwind shear layers accumulates near the corners of the jet and produces two sets of vortex pairs, the former of which couple with the shear-layer vortices to produce large, counter-rotating vortices in the freestream, while the latter are unstable and periodically produce hairpin vortices in the main-flow boundary layer and elongated vortices in the freestream behind the jet. The departure of the jet flowfield from the vortical structures typically observed in transverse jets illustrates the substantive effect of the favourable streamwise pressure gradient on the flowfield created by the jet.

The instantaneous turbulent velocity vector field is generated by the direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equation with the aid of a pseudospectral code. It is assumed that the fiber is composed of five rigidly attached ellipsoidal links. The dynamic behavior of these elongated and irregular shaped particles is markedly different from the spherical ones. The hydrodynamic forces and torques acting on the fiber are evaluated and the equations governing the translational and rotational motions of the fiber are analyzed. Euler's four parameters are used, and motions of fibrous particles in the turbulent channel flow field are studied. Ensembles of 8000 fiber trajectories are generated and are used for evaluating various statistics. Root mean-square fiber velocities and fiber concentrations at different distances from the wall are evaluated and discussed. Empirical models for the deposition rate of curly fibers are also developed. The model predictions are compared with the simulation data and good agreement is observed.

AB  - The laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid is considered through a prototype radial entrance geometry that consists of a circular pipe joined to the bottom plate of a pair of parallel circular plates, a configuration that mimics and idealizes important practical flows. The equations of motion are solved numerically to compute the velocity field as a function of the Reynolds number Re and the geometrical aspect ratio e. This work extends limited previous results on flow development in this entrance geometry. A range of e and Re are considered, and the Re–e parameter space corresponding to flow separation is delineated. The computed results are used to illustrate the role of the aspect ratio in influencing flow development for small e≲1 and are analyzed to quantify the large e asymptotic behavior of various quantities characterizing the developing flow field. The limiting value of aspect ratio beyond which the asymptotic behavior applies is relatively small e≳2. The dependence of these quantities on Re also is analyzed. The results are discussed in light of available experimental measurements and existing analytical results. An important implication of the results in the context of confined laminar impinging jet heat transfer is described. The entrance configuration is contrasted with a companion radial entrance flow (radial source flow); although flow separation occurs in both cases, some basic features are quite distinct. The influence of the elongational character of this radial flow field is highlighted by comparing certain aspects of flow development between this axisymmetric configuration and its 2-D Cartesian analog.

AB  - Three-dimensional fully developed turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer in a square duct are numerically investigated with the author's anisotropic low-Reynolds-number k-~ turbulence model. Special attention has been given to the regions close to the wall and the corner, which are known to influence the characteristics of secondary flow a great deal. Hence, instead of the common wall function approach, the no-slip boundary condition at the wall is directly used. Velocity and temperature profiles are predicted for fully developed turbulent flows with constant wall temperature. The predicted variations of both local wall shear stress and local wall heat flux are shown to be in close agreement with available experimental data. The present paper also presents the budget of turbulent kinetic energy equation and the systematic evaluation for existing wall function forms. The commonly adopted wall function forms that are valid for two-dimensional flows are found to be inadequate for three-dimensional turbulent flows in a square duct.

AB  - This paper presents a cohesive study of flowin a jet-driven vortex chamber for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, contraction ratios, inlet angles, areas, and aspect ratios. Dimensional analysis furnishes the general functional relationships between the fundamental dimensionless quantities.Application of the integral equations of continuity and energy over the control volume, along with the minimum-pressure-drop or maximum-flow-rate postulate, provide the required analytical means to relate the predominant nondimensional parameters such as the chamber geometry, core size, pressure drop, Reynolds number, and viscous losses. The theoretical results successfully capture most of the salient properties of the flow. A parametric examination explores how the pressure coefficient and the core size vary with the different dimensionless properties. The observations show the pressure drop to decrease with the length. At first this appears to be counterintuitive since one habitually expects the pressure drop to be larger for longer pipes. A closer consideration, however, reveals that in addition to the radialaxial plane flow there is also a substantial centrifugal force, which decays with the length, thus shaping the development of the overall flowfield. Last, the current theory confirms that the previous published models are only applicable for high Reynolds numbers where the inertia dominates the viscous forces.

Velocity profiles for the axial, tangential, and radial directions of flow have been obtained for adiabatic conditions and for wide and narrow annular gaps. It has been shown that the onset of Taylor vortex flow has a pronounced effect on the velocity profiles for all three directions. However, while the profiles for the axial and tangential directions are explicable, those for the radial direction are not so, at present. Also, it was found that heat transfer through the outer annular surface had a greater effect on the radial velocity profile than on the axial or tangential, but in the narrow gap case only.

AB  - In this paper we examine the mutual interactions between microbubbles and turbulence in vertical channel flow. An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach based on pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulation is used: bubbles are momentum coupled with the fluid and are treated as pointwise spheres subject to gravity, drag, added mass, pressure gradient, Basset and lift forces. Two different flow configurations (upward and downward channel flow of water at shear Reynolds number Re 
                        ??=150) and four different bubble diameters are considered, assuming that bubbles are non-deformable (i.e. small Eotvos number) and contaminated by surfactants (i.e. no-slip condition applies at bubble surface). Confirming previous knowledge, we find macroscopically different bubble distribution in the two flow configurations, with lift segregating bubbles at the wall in upflow and preventing bubbles from reaching the near-wall region in downflow. Due to local momentum exchange with the carrier fluid and to the differences in bubble distribution, we also observe significant increase (resp. decrease) of both wall shear and liquid flowrate in upflow (resp. downflow). We propose a novel force scaling to examine results in vertical turbulent bubbly flows, which can help to judge differences in the turbulence features due to bubble presence. By examining two-phase flow energy spectra, we show that bubbles determine an enhancement (resp. attenuation) of energy at small (resp. large) flow scales, a feature already observed in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Bubble-induced flow field modifications, in turn, alter significantly the dynamics of the bubbles and lead to different trends in preferential concentration and wall deposition. In this picture, a crucial role is played by the lift force, which is a delicate issue when accurate models of shear flows with bubbles are sought. We analyze and discuss all the observed trends emphasizing the impact that the lift force model has on the simulations. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The dominant feature of this flow is a pro- nounced horseshoe vortex evolving in the junction region following separation ahead of the aerofoil’s leading edge. This case is one of 6 forming a broad programme of turbulence-model validation by UMIST, Loughborough University, BAE Systems, Aircraft Research Association, Rolls-Royce plc and DERA. Key aspects of this collaboration were a high level of interaction between the partners, the use of common grids and boundary conditions, and numerical verifications aimed at maximising confidence in the validity of the computational solutions. In total, 12 turbulence models were studied by four partners. Model performance is judged by comparing solutions with experimental data for pressure fields on the plane wall and around the aerofoil; for velocity, turbulence energy, shear stress and streamwise normal stress in the upstream symmetry plane; and for velocity, turbulence energy and shear stress in cross-flow planes downstream of the aerofoil leading edge. The emphasis of the study is on the structure of the horseshoe vortex and its effects on the forward flow. The main finding of the study is that, for this particular 3D flow, second-moment closure offers predictive advantages over the othermodels examined, especially in terms of the far-field structure of the horse-shoe vortex, although no model achieves close agreement with the experimental data in respect of bothmean flow and turbulence quantities.

AB  - Turbulent pipe flows subject to temporal acceleration have been considered in this study. Large-eddy simulations (LESs) of accelerated turbulent flow in a circular pipe were performed to study the response of the turbulent flow to temporal acceleration. The simulations were started with the fully-developed turbulent pipe flow at an initial Re number, and then a constant temporal acceleration was applied. During the acceleration, the Reynolds number of the pipe flow, based on the pipe diameter and the bulk-mean velocity, increased linearly from Re 
                        D=7000 to 36,000. A dimensionless response time for various flow quantities was introduced to measure the delays in the response of the near-wall turbulence to temporal acceleration. The results reveal distinctive features of the delays responsible for turbulence production, energy redistribution, and radial propagation. The conditionally-averaged flow fields associated with Reynolds shear stress producing events were analysed. In the transient flows, sweeps and ejections were closely linked to the delays of turbulence production and of turbulence propagation away from the wall. It is found that strong sweep events were related to the delayed turbulence production in the near-wall region, while ejection events were associated with the propagation of the turbulence away from the wall. The results show that the anisotropy of the turbulence was enhanced during the transient, and this would be a challenging problem to standard turbulence models. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Numerical simulation of an air and water two-phase flow in a 20 μm ID tube is carried out. A focus is laid upon the flow and heat transfer characteristics in bubble-train flows. An axisymmetric two-dimensional flow is assumed. The finite difference method is used to solve the governing equations, while the level set method is adopted for capturing the interface of gas and liquid. In each simulation, the mean pressure gradient and the wall heat flux are kept constant. The simulation is repeated under different conditions of pressure gradient and void fraction. The superficial Reynolds numbers of gas and liquid phases studied are 0.34-13 and 16-490, respectively, and the capillary number is 0.0087-0.27. Regardless of the flow conditions, the gas-phase velocity is found approximately 1.2 times higher than the liquid-phase velocity. This is in accordance with the Armand correlation valid for two-phase flows in macro-sized tubes. The two-phase friction coefficient is found to be scaled with the Reynolds number based on the effective viscosity of the Einstein type. The computed wall temperature distribution is qualitatively similar to that observed experimentally in a mini channel. The local Nusselt number beneath the bubble is found notably higher than that of single-phase flow. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The deposition of particles in fully-developed turbulent channel flow has been calculated using  large eddy simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Calculations were performed for  Reynolds numbers of 11,160 and 79,400 (based on bulk velocity and hydraulic diameter); subgrid-scale  stresses were parameterized using the dynamic eddy viscosity model. Particle motion was governed by both  drag and lift. The effect of particle-particle interactions as well as modification of the turbulent carrier  flow by the particles was neglected. In agreement with previous studies, LES results show that particles  accumulate in the near-wall region. Statistical measures from the LES calculations such as the particle  deposition rate are in reasonable agreement with the direct numerical simulation results of McLaughlin  (1989). For particles with identical relaxation times in wall units, deposition rates at the two Reynolds  numbers were nearly identical. Issues relevant to application of LES for predicting particle deposition at  high Reynolds numbers are also discussed.

The effect of stochastic fluctuation of velocity and temperature on the time mean and periodically changing parts of flow and thermal fields was modeled with a k-?? type turbulence model. Numerical results of heat transfer coefficient obtained with a modified LS model agree well with the experimental data. Generation of the dissimilarity between the momentum transfer and heat transfer occurring in the studied boundary layer was successfully predicted. Discussion is developed for the washing action exerted by a spanwise vortex and its role of generating the dissimilarity.

AB  - This experimental investigation deals with transition phenomena of a separated boundary layer under unsteady inlet flow conditions. The main purpose of this investigation is to understand the influence of the rotor-stator interaction in turbomachinery on the subsequent, highly loaded boundary layer. The research project is divided into two phases. In the first phase, which has been completed recently, only the variation of mean velocity caused by upstream blades was simulated in the experiments while the free-stream turbulence intensity was retained at a constant low level. The experiments are carried out in an Eifel-type wind tunnel to investigate the laminar separated boundary layer of a flat plate under oscillating inlet conditions. The adverse pressure gradient, similar to that of turbomachines, is generated by the contoured upper wall. The unsteadiness is produced by a rotating flap located downstream of the test section. The reduced frequency, the amplitude and the mean Reynolds number are varied to simulate the conditions prevailing in turbomachines. In addition to the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability of the separated shear layer, a lower frequency instability was observed. This is frequently referred to as ‘free shear layer flapping’ and results in two distinctly different ways of re-attachment, depending primarily on the Reynolds number. For low momentum thickness Reynolds numbers at the separation point, large-scale vortices locked to the frequency of the unsteady main flow are identified. They originate nearly at the top of the separation bubble and are ejected downstream. A fully turbulent boundary layer develops after these vortices mix out. For higher Reynolds numbers, transition is completed within a short length of the free shear layer and the re-attachment region. The characteristic momentum thickness Reynolds number separating these two regimes in unsteady flow is about 125. The Strouhal number (reduced frequency) does not appear to have any significant effect. Based on the experimental results, this behaviour is discussed in some detail.

AB  - Gas-particle turbulent channel flow at Reτ = 644, loaded with copper particles at a mass flow ratio of 2%, is studied numerically by large eddy simulation (LES) coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). Inter-particle collisions and correction of drag force in the vicinity of walls are accounted for. Focus is made on the influence of particle wall boundary conditions and their influence on the statistical structure of the flow. It is shown that accordance with experimental data can be improved if a mechanism which can suppress the direct re-entrainment of particles after the impact at the wall is present. Present result shows that inter-particle collisions may play an important role in the re-distribution of particle momentum among different components even at low mass loading conditions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For this purpose this paper proposes a model of unbalanced sustainable development. The model is based on an old theory in development economics, namely unbalanced growth.

AB  - We present experimental results on the mean flow development and potential core lengths of single- and dual. stream compressible air jets. The research is relevant to noise emission. thermal signature, and combustion in high-speed turbulent jets. The primary flow was set at Mach number 1.5, and the secondary stream was supplied at four subsonic Mach numbers from nozzles of variable area and shape. Coaxial and eccentric nozzle configurations were investigated. In the coaxial arrangements, the secondary flow reduces the growth rate of the primary shear layer and elongates the primary potential core. As a result, the mass entrainment rate of the coaxial jet is less than that of the single jet. The potential core is stretched by 68% when a secondary stream with area ratio 2.9 is supplied at Mach number 0.9. The eccentric configuration shows substantial improvement in mixing over the coaxial case and achieves an entrainment rate roughly equal to that of the single jet when the exit areas of the primary and secondary streams are approximately equal. On an equal mass flow rate basis, the eccentric dual-stream jet with area ratio 0.9 actually mixes faster than the single jet. The potential core and the supersonic region of the jet are elongated much less than in the coaxial case. A semi-empirical model, based on the present data and classical shear layer relations, is proposed for the primary and secondary core lengths of coaxial jets.

The results of direct numerical simulation (DNS) for various Prandlt numbers ranging from 0.1-1.5 were compared with existing DNS data for ordinary two-dimensional heat transfer from uniformly heated walls. The Prandtl numbers effect on the spanwise eddy diffusivity of heat was found to be quite similar to that on the wall-normal component. Similarity was also observed betewen the destruction of the spanwise turbulent heat flux and that of the wall-normal component.

The configurations is the fully developed channel flow with uniform heating from both walls. The Reynolds number based on the friction velocity and the channel half width is 180. Turbulent Prandtl number Prt is independent of Pr except for Pr > 0.1. The time constant ratio is also obtained and its dependence on the Pr is examined. Budget of wall-normal heat flux shows that the temperature-pressure gradient correlation (TPG) is dominant as the destruction terms for a larger Pr while the dissipation is for a smaller Pr. The two become comparable at Pr=0.2 for the present Reynolds number. The budget terms in the transport equation for the turbulent heat flux are visualized and the influence of Pr is discussed.

AB  - An experimental study of wall shear stress in an accelerating flow of water in a pipe ramping between two steady turbulent flows has been undertaken in a large-scale experimental facility. Ensemble averaged mean and r.m.s. of the turbulent fluctuations of wall shear stresses have been derived from hot-film measurements from many repeated runs. The initial Reynolds number and the acceleration rate were varied systematically to give values of a non-dimensional acceleration parameter ranging from 0.16 to 14. The wall shear stress has been shown to follow a three-stage development. Stage 1 is associated with a period of minimal turbulence response; the measured turbulent wall shear stress remains largely unchanged except for a very slow increase which is readily associated with the stretching of existing turbulent eddies as a result of flow acceleration. In this condition of nearly frozen turbulence, the unsteady wall shear stress is driven primarily by flow inertia, initially increasing rapidly and overshooting the pseudo-steady value, but then increasing more slowly and eventually falling below the pseudo-steady value. This variation is predicted by an analytical expression derived from a laminar flow formulation. The start of Stage 2 is marked by the generation of new turbulence causing both the mean and turbulent wall shear stress to increase rapidly, although there is a clear offset between the responses of these two quantities. The turbulent wall shear, reflecting local turbulent activities near the wall, responds first and the mean wall shear, reflecting conditions across the entire flow field, responds somewhat later. In Stage 3, the wall shear stress exhibits a quasi-steady variation. The duration of the initial period of nearly frozen turbulence response close to the wall increases with decreasing initial Reynolds number and with increasing acceleration. The latter is in contrast to the response of turbulence in the core of the flow, which previous measurements have shown to be independent of the rate of acceleration.

AB  - The Immersed Boundary (IB) method proposed by Uhlmann for Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of fluid flow through dense fluid-particle systems is extended to systems with interphase heat transport. A fixed Eulerian grid is employed to solve the momentum and energy equations by traditional computational fluid dynamics methods. Our numerical method treats the particulate phase by introducing momentum and heat source terms at the boundary of the solid particle, which represent the momentum and thermal interactions between fluid and particle. Forced convection heat transfer was simulated for a single sphere and an in-line array of 3 spheres to assess the accuracy of the present method. Non-isothermal flows past stationary random arrays of spheres are investigated to assess the capability of our simulation method for dense particulate systems. All results are in satisfactory agreement with reported experimental and numerical results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents results of a large eddy simulation (LES) combined with Lagrangian particle tracking and a point-force approximation for the feedback effect of particles on the downward turbulent gaseous flow in a vertical channel. The LES predictions are compared with the results obtained by direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a finer computational mesh. A parametric study is conducted for particles with two response times in simulations with and without streamwise gravitational settling and elastic, binary interparticle collisions. It is shown that the classical and the dynamic Smagorinsky turbulence models adequately predict the particle-induced changes in the mean streamwise velocity and the Reynolds stresses of the carrier phase for the range of parameters studied. However, the largest discrepancies between the LES and DNS results are found in the cases of particle-laden flows. Conditional sampling of the instantaneous resolved flow fields indicates that the mechanisms by which particles directly oppose the production of momentum and vorticity of the organized fluid motions are also observed in the LES results. However, the geometric features of the near-wall quasistreamwise vortices are overestimated by the use of both turbulence models compared to the DNS predictions. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study reports detailed statistics for velocity and transfer rates of heavy particles dispersed in turbulent boundary layers. Statistics have been extracted from a homogeneous source of data covering a large target parameter space and are used here to analyze the effects of gravity and lift on particle dispersion and deposition in a systematic way. Datasets were obtained performing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of particle-laden turbulent upward/downward flow in a vertical channel. Six values for the particle timescale (the particle Stokes number, St) ranging three orders of magnitude were considered to analyze the deposition process as the controlling mechanism was shifting from turbulent diffusion to inertia-moderated crossing trajectories. For the particle timescales examined, gravity and lift do not influence the qualitative behavior of particles even though velocity profiles and deposition coefficients are modified in a non-monotonic fashion, reaching an optimum for St ≥ 15. Physical mechanisms for the different behavior are discussed. Raw data and statistics obtained from the present DNS are made available at http://cfd.cineca.it (mirror site: http://158.110.32.35/download/database) and can be used to test simple models and closure equations for multiphase RANS and Large Eddy simulations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are performed to investigate the shear effects on flow around a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers of Re=60-1000. The shear parameter, Β, which is based on the velocity gradient, cylinder diameter and upstream mean velocity at the center plane of the cylinder, varies from 0 to 0.30. Variations of Strouhal number, drag and lift coefficients, and unsteady wake structures with shear parameter are studied, along with their dependence on Reynolds number. The presented simulation provides detailed information for the flow field around a circular cylinder in shear flow. This study shows that the Strouhal number exhibits no significant variation with shear parameter. The stagnation point moves to the high-velocity side almost linearly with shear parameter, and this result mainly influences the aerodynamic forces acting on a circular cylinder in shear flow. Both the Reynolds number and shear parameter influence the movement of the stagnation point and separation point. Mode A wake instability is suppressed into parallel vortex shedding mode at a certain shear parameter. The lift force increases with increasing shear parameter and acts from the high-velocity side to the low-velocity side. In addition, a simple method to estimate the lift force coefficient in shear flow is provided. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this work, we employ direct numerical simulation of turbulence one-way coupled to Lagrangian tracking to investigate microbubble distribution in upward and downward channel flow. We consider a closed channel flow at Re??=150 and a dispersion of microbubbles characterized by a diameter of 220??m. Bubbles are assumed contaminated by surfactants (i.e., no-slip condition at bubble surface) and are subject to drag, gravity, pressure gradient forces, Basset history force and aerodynamic lift. Our results confirm previous findings and show that microbubble dispersion in the wall region is dominated by the action of gravity combined with the lift force. Specifically, in upward flow, bubble rising velocity in the wall region generates a lift force which pushes bubbles to the wall. In downward flow, bubble rising velocity against the fluid generates a lift force which prevents microbubbles from reaching the viscous sublayer. In the wall region, we observe bubble preferential segregation in high-speed regions in the downflow case, and non-preferential distribution in the upflow case. This phenomenon is related to the effect of the lift force. Compared to experiments, the current lift force model produces larger consequences, this effect being overemphasized in the upflow case in which a large number of bubbles is segregated near the wall. In this case, the resulting bubble wall-peak of concentration outranges experimental results. These results, so deeply related to the lift force, underline the crucial role of current understanding of the fluid forces acting on bubbles and help to formulate questions about available force models, bubble-bubble interactions and two-way coupling which can be crucial for accurate predictions in the region very near the wall. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is carried out to investigate the velocity shear flow over rectangular cylinders with different side ratios of B/. D= 1, 5 and 8 (B: breadth of the cylinder, D: depth of the cylinder). The shear rate is expressed by a dimensionless shear parameter, defined by the oncoming velocity gradient, the cylinder thickness and the upstream velocity at the center plane of the cylinder. The Reynolds number based on the cylinder depth and the upstream velocity at the center plane of the cylinder is 22,000. Particular attention is devoted to variations with side ratio of shear flow and aerodynamic forces acting on the rectangular cylinders. It is shown that the side-ratio-dependent Strouhal number remains almost unchanged with shear parameter. The shear flow patterns around the rectangular cylinders vary with side ratio, resulting in a side-ratio-dependent aerodynamic force. An interesting finding is that the lift forces on the rectangular cylinders with B/. D= 5 and 8 act from the high-velocity side to the low-velocity side, while for B/. D= 1 they act from the low-velocity side to the high-velocity side. The stagnation point moves to the high-velocity side almost linearly with shear parameter for all investigated side ratios, implying that the movement of stagnation point to the high-velocity side is an inherent behavior in shear flow. In addition, the unsteady flow structures and the mechanism for the change of aerodynamic force with side ratio in shear flows are investigated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper scrutinises the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach to simulate the behaviour of inter-acting particles in a turbulent channel flow. A series of simulations that are fully (four-way), two-way and one-way coupled are performed in order to investigate the importance of the individual physical phenomena occurring in particle-laden flows. Moreover, the soft sphere and hard sphere models, which describe the interaction between colliding particles, are compared with each other and the drawbacks and advantages of each algorithm are discussed. Different models to describe the sub-grid scale stresses with LES are compared. Finally, simulations accounting for the rough walls of the channel are compared to simulations with smooth walls. The results of the simulations are discussed with the aid of the experimental data of Kussin J. and Sommerfeld M., 2002, Experimental studies on particle behaviour and turbulence modification in horizontal channel flow with different wall roughness, Exp. in Fluids, 33, pp. 143-159 of Reynolds number 42,000 based on the full channel height. The simulations are carried out in a three-dimensional domain of 0.175. m. ??. 0.035. m ??. 0.035. m where the direction of gravity is perpendicular to the flow. The simulation results demonstrate that rough walls and inter-particle collisions have an important effect in redistributing the particles across the channel, even for very dilute flows. A new roughness model is proposed which takes into account the fact that a collision in the soft sphere model is fully resolved and it is shown that the new model is in very good agreement with the available experimental data. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The results are depth-averaged and thereby information is obtained on the 2D horizontal fluctuations in the channel. The total turbulence is decomposed into 2D and 3D fluctuations and the energy content of these as well as their spectral distribution is studied. It is found that only 15% of the fluctuating energy is contained in the 2D fluctuations and that these are mostly of scales larger than the water depth while the 3D fluctuations are restricted by the limited vertical extent of the water body and have scales smaller than the water depth. Information is obtained on the dispersion terms arising from the depth-averaging procedure, and scalar transport due to a vertical line source of tracer is studied thereby investigating the contribution of the 2D and 3D fluctuations to the transverse mixing of the scalar.

Calculations were performed using second-order finite volume discretisation in space on co-located meshes. A hybrid calculation approach based on Lighthill's acoustic analogy is explained. Results of the simulation are intended to be used as a database for the validation of different discretisation schemes for the flow computation and simulation approaches for the calculation of sound radiation using a hybrid approach. Turbulent statistics are presented along with aeroacoustic source regions. Strong and weak forms of the aeroacoustic source term are presented and compared. For visualization purposes, the strong form is more suitable, whereas for the calculation of sound radiation both forms can be used. From the visualization of the aeroacoustic sources, it can be seen that they mainly concentrate on the region of the leading edge of the step and the shear layer close to the step. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper describes the continuation of an investigation into the effects of increased flow on the dissolved oxygen concentration in the River Maun, UK. A previous investigation indicated that an oxygen demand additional to that in the water phase is observed during and directly after intermittent discharges. Simplified modelling of the river indicated that the additional oxygen demand was possibly linked to the disturbance of sediment during such events. A device has been developed which can be used in situ to measure the effect of flow velocity (shear stress) on the additional demand. Preliminary tests have shown that the inferred demand is significant. It is proposed that the in situ device now be used to measure the oxygen demand of the bed material at a number of locations and flow speeds and that a relationship between the additional demand and velocity be established, with the aim of incorporating such a relationship into a simplified model.

AB  - The symptoms following sinus and vein occlusion observed in patients and experimental animals display a considerable variability that so far remains largely unexplained. In a rat cortical vein occlusion model using a photochemical thrombotic technique, we examined changes in the cerebral venous flow pattern by fluorescence angiography and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood volume fraction (CBVF) by a modern laser Doppler "scanning" technique. Brain damage was assessed histologically. Fluorescence angiographic findings fell into two groups: group A, rats with an altered venous flow pattern after occlusion (n = 12), and group B, rats with interruption of blood flow and/or a growing venous thrombus (n = 5). In addition, sham-operated animals made up group C (n = 5). Extravasation of fluorescein, a massive decrease in rCBF, a short-lasting increase in CBVF, and regional brain damage were typical for group B. In addition, cortical CBF mapping revealed a transient hyperperfusion zone with hyperemia surrounding a hypoperfused ischemic core in group B. A circulation perturbation following venous occlusion appeared near those occluded cerebral veins without sufficient collateral flow. Furthermore, the venous thrombus continued to grow, accompanied by local critical ischemia and severe brain damage. Conversely, 71% of the animals (12 of 17) tolerated occlusion of a solitary vein without major flow disturbances or histological evidence of damage to the CNS (group A).

A definite concavity is found in the velocity profile near the tube entrance for all cases. Results for Newtonian fluids are compared with previous studies in which boundary-layer theory was used. In the region away from the entrance, it is found that the present results are in good agreement with previous works.

AB  - Experimental investigation has been made on the flow and thermal fields\nover a heated two-dimensional hill with a cosine-squared shape. The\ndetailed turbulent characteristics are measured by a backscatter-type\ntwo-component LDV, a PIV system, a fine thermocouple and a cold-wire\nprobe. In the reverse-flow region on the leeward side of the hill, the\nturbulence intensities and the Reynolds shear stress show much larger\nvalues than in a canonical wall-bounded shear flow. The mean\ntemperature maintains a relatively high value below the location where\nthe horizontal mean velocity rapidly decreases. At the outer edge of\nthe reverse-flow region, there exists a second maximum intensity of\ntemperature fluctuations. The instantaneous temperature waveforms near\nthe heated surface show very large amplitude consisting of\nhigh-frequency fluctuations superimposed on the low-frequency motions.\nSimultaneous measurement of velocity and temperature is also done using\na combination of a two-component LDV and a fine-wire thermocouple\ntogether with digital response compensation. In the downstream region\nof the hill, the horizontal and vertical turbulent heat fluxes become\nmaximum at the hill-top height, and tend to diffuse in the vertical\ndirection. On the other hand, in the reverse-flow region formed behind\nthe hill, both of the heat fluxes decrease remarkably. In particular,\nit is worth noting that the horizontal turbulent heat flux near the\nsurface becomes opposite in sign to that in the forward flow region.\nThis is mainly due to the reversal of the mean flow direction.

AB  - In this paper, a direct numerical simulation of a fully developed turbulent flow and heat transfer are studied in a square duct with an imposed temperature difference between the vertical walls and the perfectly insulated horizontal walls. The natural convection is considered on the cross section in the duct. The numerical scheme employs a time-splitting method to integrate the three dimensional incompressible Navier- Stokes equation. The unsteady flow field was simulated at a Reynolds number of 400 based on the Mean friction velocity and the hydraulic diameter (Rem = 6200), while the Prandtl number (Pr) is assumed 0.71. Four different Grashof numbers (Gr =104,105,106 and 107) are con- sidered. The results show that the secondary flow and turbulent characteristics are not affected obviously at lower Grashof number (Gr £ 105) cases, while for the higher Grashof number cases, natural convection has an important effect, but the mean flow and mean temper- ature at the cross section are also affected strongly by Reynolds stresses. Compared with the laminar heat transfer at the same Grashof number, the intensity of the combined heat transfer is somewhat decreased.

AB  - An immersed-boundary method was employed to perform a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow around a wall-mounted cube in a fully developed turbulent channel for a Reynolds number Re = 5610, based on the bulk velocity and the channel height. Instantaneous results of the DNS of a plain channel flow were used as a fully developed inflow condition for the main channel. The results confirm the unsteadiness of the considered flow caused by the unstable interaction of a horseshoe vortex formed in front of the cube and on both its sides with an arch-type vortex behind the cube. The time-averaged data of the turbulence mean-square intensities, Reynolds shear stresses, kinetic energy and dissipation rate are presented. The negative turbulence production is predicted in the region in front of the cube where the main horseshoe vortex originates. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Results are presented for the initiation of slug-type structures from stratified 2D, two-layer pressure-driven channel flow. Good agreement is obtained with an Orr-Sommerfeld-type stability analysis for the growth rate and wave speed of very small disturbances. The numerical results elucidate the non-linear evolution of the interface shape once small disturbances have grown substantially. It is shown that relatively short waves (which are the most unstable according to linear theory) saturate when the length of the periodic domain is equally short. In longer domains, coalescence of short waves of small-amplitude is shown to lead to large-amplitude long waves, which subsequently exhibit a tendency towards slug formation. The non-uniform distribution of the interfacial shear stress is shown to be a significant mechanism for wave growth in the non-linear regime. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presented study examines various methods for phase-averaging the naturally os- cillating flow field of an enlarged fluidic oscillator acquired by a high-speed PIV system. Because of the absence of an external trigger, phase-averaging the acquired data is chal- lenging. Mathematical and physical methods are categorized and described. The results of these methods are evaluated for their accuracy in capturing the natural flow field. It is found that the mathematical methods, especially the method of proper orthogonal de- composition, produce reasonable qualitative results. However, compared to the physical methods, shortcomings in quantitative accuracy are revealed. The physical methods require a time-resolved reference signal. Two possibilities to identify the oscillation periods in the reference signal are described and compared. It is found that applying an autocorrelation on the reference signal improves the period identification due to consideration of a locally fluctuating mean value. This period identification method and according phase-averaging yields the best results regarding the minimum fluctuation of the oscillation period lengths. The according procedure is described in detail and applied to the internal and external flow field of the fluidic oscillator.

AB  - Numerical simulations were conducted to model the transient flow development in a naturally ventilated space containing a centrally located localized source of heat. The simulations were compared with a series of small-scale laboratory experiments and existing theoretical models. The aim of the work was to benchmark CFD models for time-dependent buoyancy-driven natural ventilation against previously published experimental results and theoretical models. The simulations agree well with experimental\nresults during the initial development of the room stratification. The CFD results accurately predict the\nmaximum depth of the hot buoyant layer at the top of the room as well as the steady-state interface height which separates the warm upper buoyant layer from the cooler air below. The simulations also predict well the time taken for the buoyant upper layer to reach its maximum depth. However, at longer times the results diverge. This may be due to thermal diffusion and mixing at the interface between the upper and lower layers due to the inflow from the floor level vents.

AB  - In the present study, the effect of the secondary helical flow on the variation of wall shear stress using an asymmetrical branch model has been studied experimentally. The experiment has been carried out for a branch model, such as the inferior mesenteric artery from the abdominal aorta, so that the daughter tube branches out from the parent tube at 45 deg with the radius of curvature at the upstream corner of the daughter tube. In the experiment, the velocity profiles and the wall shear stress have been measured by a laser Doppler velocimeter and the electrochemical method, respectively. The results show that the variation of wall shear stress along the proximal wall strongly depends on the geometry of the proximal wall. Furthermore, the variation of wall shear stress results from the secondary helical motion flowing into the daughter tube from the parent tube. The wall shear stress estimated from the velocity profile is compared with that measured by the electrochemical method.

AB  - In this paper, laser-Doppler anemometry measurement of steady flow development in a model human aorta has been reported. Studies were made with uniform entry flow at the root of the aorta and our measurements showed the establishment of a pair of Dean vortices in the mid-arch region. Subsequently, the nature of flow development past centrally occluding caged ball valves in the model aorta was investigated. Our studies showed that in the ascending aorta, an asymmetric velocity profile is obtained with larger velocity gradients towards the inner wall of tertiary curvature (anatomically the left lateral wall) with centrally occluding valves. The peripheral flow past these valves prevented the development of Dean vortices in the mid-arch region. The caged ball valves at the root of the aorta had no discernible effect on the velocity profiles in the brachio-cephalic artery.

AB  - A large eddy simulation (LES) coupled with a Lagrangian stochastic model has been applied to the study of droplet dispersion in a turbulent boundary layer. Droplets are tracked in a Lagrangian way. The velocity of the fluid particle along the droplet trajectory is considered to have a large-scale part and a small-scale part given by a modified three-dimensional Langevin model using the filtered subgrid scale (SGS) statistics. An appropriate Lagrangian correlation timescale is considered in order to include the influences of gravity and inertia. Two-way coupling is also taken into account. The inter-droplet collision has been introduced as the main mechanism of secondary breakup. A stochastic model for breakup has been generalized for coalescence simulation, thereby two phenomena, coalescence and breakup are simulated in the framework of a single stochastic model. The parameters of this model, selectively for coalescence and for breakup, are computed dynamically by relating them to the local resolved properties of the dispersed phase compared to the main fluid. The model is validated by comparison with an agglomeration model and with experimental results on secondary breakup. The LES coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking and the model for droplet coalescence and breakup is applied to the study of the atmospheric dispersion of wet cooling tower plumes. The simulations are done for different droplet size distributions and volume fractions. We focused on the influence of these parameters on mean concentration, concentration variance and mass flux profiles. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The algorithm employed makes use of a mixed interpolation formulation to approximate the discretised governing equations for elimination on a Langrangian type moving mesh. Significant savings in CPU time are realised by virtue of the the air domain not being considered in the finite element analysis. The advantages and drawbacks of commonly used methods are discussed, and a method proposed for the numerical simulation of flow where the free surface boundary conditions are important. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving typical industrial flow problems is demonstrated using numerical examples. The results obtained are compared with analytical and numerical data with a view to validating the algorithm.

The quantitative and qualitative changes of the non-inherent nature of material flow determine the development states of material flow, which mainly manifest three states, namely, traditional material flow, modern material flow and transform of the traditional material flow to modern material flow. To further reveal the change rule of material flow development states, this paper takes establishment of three-dimensional structure model of material flow state as the theoretic foundation, express it with the ordered triple M <sub>F</sub>=SMTE, C, V(t). It reflects the material flow state changes with non-inherent nature SMTE about V(t) of C.

AB  - Computations of turbulent trailing-edge flow have been carried out at a Reynolds number of 1000 (based on the free-stream quantities and the trailing-edge thickness) using an unsteady 3D Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) code, in which two-equation (k–ε) turbulence models with various low-Re near wall treatments were implemented. Results from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the same flow are available for comparison and assessment of the turbulence models used in the URANS code. Two-dimensional URANS calculations are carried out with turbulence mean properties from the DNS used at the inlet; the inflow boundary-layer thickness is 6.42 times the trailing-edge thickness, close to typical turbine blade flow applications. Many of the key flow features observed in DNS are also predicted by the modelling; the flow oscillates in a similar way to that found in bluff-body flow with a von Kármán vortex street produced downstream. The recirculation bubble predicted by unsteady RANS has a similar shape to DNS, but with a length only half that of the DNS. It is found that the unsteadiness plays an important role in the near wake, comparable to the modelled turbulence, but that far downstream the modelled turbulence dominates. A spectral analysis applied to the force coefficient in the wall normal direction shows that a Strouhal number based on the trailing-edge thickness is 0.23, approximately twice that observed in DNS. To assess the modelling approximations, an a priori analysis has been applied using DNS data for the key individual terms in the turbulence model equations. A possible refinement to account for pressure transport is discussed.

AB  - The vortex dynamics of a shear flow over a circular cylinder is studied by means of Direct Numerical Simulation. Four flow configurations are selected in order to consider the influence of three physical parameters: the vertical extension of the shear zone, the vertical domain size and the shear intensity. Despite the moderate value of the median Reynolds number considered (Re = 200), the non-uniform character of the upstream flow leads to the formation of complex Karman streets behind the cylinder for each case. The analysis of the animations shows the occurrence of oblique vortex shedding driven through complex synchronization processes. The shear imposes strong distortions on the Karman vortices and dislocations are regularly observed. The simple observation of the vortical animations does not allow an unambiguous identification of the cellular pattern of vortex shedding. This phenomenon can be more rigorously described by a frequency analysis presented in this paper. It is shown that the main frequency selection is mainly conditioned by a local adjustment of oblique vortex shedding to the upstream velocity. However, due to the preservation of the spatial coherence of the flow, the variation of the main flow frequency occurs by jump along the cylinder axis direction, the distance between two jumps corresponding to the size of a cell. The Karman vortex formation is triggered in the high-speed region of the flow, but paradoxically, the local vortex shedding frequency found in this zone seems to be strongly influenced by the dynamics of the slow part of the flow. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A calculation procedure is described for the class of flows in which the flow domain contains numerous dispersed solid objects such as tubes or rods. The central idea is to treat the solid objects as distributed resistances to flow and heat transfer. The calculation procedure is illustrated by an application to a steam generator of a nuclear power plant. The three-dimensional flow field and the enthalpy distribution are calculated. Since details of the thermal-hydraulic behaviour of the steam generator can thus be inexpensively predicted, the procedure can be useful to designers.

AB  - Two separate mechanisms can be responsible for natural convection flow between the hot and cold zones of a multizone enclosure: (1) bulk density differences created by temperature differences between the fluid in the hot and cold zones (bulk-density-driven flow) and, (2) thermosyphon “pumping” generated by boundary layers or plumes (motion-pressure-driven flow). This paper reports the results of an experimental study that examines the transition between flow regimes, as a function of aperture size, in a two-zone enclosure with heated and cooled end walls. A constant heat flux boundary condition was maintained on one vertical end wall, and an isothermal cold temperature sink was maintained on the opposite vertical end wall. All of the remaining surfaces were highly insulated. The transition between the boundary-layer-driven regime and the bulk-density-driven regime was established as a function of the geometry of the aperture in a partition that separated the hot and cold zones. The results of the study demonstrate that transition from the boundary-layer-driven regime to the bulk-density-driven regime is caused by blockage of the boundary layer flow when the area of the flow aperture is reduced below a critical value. A preliminary model has been developed which predicts that the critical aperture area for the onset of flow blockage is directly proportional to the number of active heat transfer surfaces and inversely proportional to the Rayleigh number which characterizes the level of heating and cooling provided to the active heat transfer surfaces.

AB  - A Galerkin finite element method is described for studying the stability of two superposed immiscible Newtonian fluids in plane Poiseuille flow. The formulation results in an algebraic eigenvalue problem of the form A L^2 + B L+ C = 0 which, after transforming to a standard generalized eigenvalue problem, is solved by the QR algorithm. The numerical results are in good agreement with previous asymptotic results. Additional results show that the finite element method is ideally suited for studying linear stability of superposed fluids when parameters characterizing the flow fall outside the range amenable to perturbation methods. The applicability of the finite element method to similar eigenvalue problems is demonstrated by analysing the steady-state spatial development of two superposed fluids in a channel.

A local particle mean velocimeter based on the ESM is further designed and established. Performance of the velocimeter is evaluated on a gravity-fed particle flow rig.

AB  - The near-field region of a coaxial jet having inner to outer diameter ratio di /do 0.39 is investigated experimentally for four ratios of annular to central jet velocities of   0.18, 0.48, 0.8, and 1.11. Measurements were acquired nonintrusively using molecular tagging velocimetry at downstream distances up to six inner jet diameters. High spatial-resolution profiles of mean axial velocity, axial turbulent intensity, skewness, kurtosis, radial gradients of mean velocity, and velocity gradient fluctuations are presented and discussed. In the near-exit region of the inner mixing layer, evidence suggests the existence of two trains of vortices shed from the inner jet wall for velocity ratios   0.18. The results also indicate that for the flow configuration examined the length of the annular potential core is a function of the velocity ratio. Turbulence characteristics of the flow appear to be influenced by both the velocity ratio and absolute velocity of the annular jet. Integral length and Taylor microscales in the inner shear layer are shown to grow monotonically with downstream distance, with their ratio reaching a constant value. It is concluded that the turbulence structure in the inner mixing layer is highly anisotropic and that the levels of anisotropy are a relatively strong function of the velocity ratio.

AB  - In this paper, the entrainment and movement of coarse particles on the bed of an open channel is numerically investigated. Rather than model the sediment transport using a concentration concept, this study treats the sediment as individual particles and investigates the interaction between turbulent coherent structures and particle entrainment. The applied methodology is a combination of the direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow, the combined finite-discrete element modeling of particle motion and collision, and the immersed boundary method for the fluid-solid interaction. In this study, flow over a water-worked rough-bed consisting of 2-3 layers of densely packed spheres is adopted and the Shields function is 0.065 which is just above the entrainment threshold to give a bed-load regime. Numerical results for turbulent flow, sediment entrainment statistics, hydrodynamic forces acting on the particles, and the interaction between turbulence coherent structures and particle entrainment are presented. It is shown that the presence of entrained particles significantly modifies the mean velocity and turbulence quantity profiles in the vicinity of a rough-bed and that the instantaneous lift force can be larger than a particle's submerged weight in a narrow region above the effective bed location, although the mean lift force is always smaller than the submerged weight. This, from a hydrodynamic point of view, presents strong evidence for a close cause-and-effect relationship between coherent structures and sediment entrainment. Furthermore, instantaneous numerical results on particle entrainment and the surrounding turbulent flow are reported which show a strong correlation between sediment entrainment and sweep events and the underlying mechanisms are discussed. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - A numerical study has been conducted for the characteristics of the periodically fully developed turbulent flow and heat transfer in a channel with transverse opposite-positioned fins. The Reynolds number range is 2 × 104 to 7 × 104. K-ε model and wall function method were adopted during the calculation. The influence of the thermal boundary condition of the fin to the heat transfer has been verified. For the studied configuration the prominent feature that differs from the similar laminar heat transfer is the phenomenon of secondary peak of the Nusselt number distribution. Assessment of heat transfer enhancement under the constraint of the same pump power reveals that the effect of the configuration of the relative fin height, e/H, equal to 0.1 is superior to those of e/H equal to 0.15 and 0.2. Comparing with the results of the channel with rod disturbances, the studied configuration possesses nearly the same heat transfer enhancement effect. Transient simulations to cases with big fin have also been conducted to assure the validity of the steady algorithm.

AB  - The flow around a low-pressure turbine rotor blade with incoming periodic wakes is computed by means of DNS and LES. The latter adopts a dynamic sub-grid-scale model. The computed results are compared with time-averaged and instantaneous measured quantities. The simulation sreveal the presence of elongated flow structures, stemming from the incoming wake vorticity, which interact with the pressure side boundary layer. As the wake approaches the upstream half of the suction side, its vortical structures are stretched and align with the main flow, resulting in an impingement at virtually zero angle of attack. Periodically, in the absence of impinging wakes, the laminar suction side boundary layer separates in the adverse pressure gradient region. Flow in the laminar separation bubble is found to undergo transition via a KelvinHelmholtz instability. Subsequent impingement of the wake inhibits separation and thus promotes boundary layer reattachment. LES provides a fair reproduction of the DNS results both in terms of instantaneous, phase-averaged, and time-averaged flow fields with a considerable reduction in computational effort.

AB  - Presented herein are the studies of the flow behaviour of blood in the entrance region of a segment of an artery. The artery has an axisymmetric mild stenosis developed right from the entry cross section. The blood has been represented by a Bhingham fluid model which also takes the core region, formed due to axial migration of the red blood cells, into account. The flow in the artery has been divided into two regions developing boundary layer and a central core region. A fourth degree velocity profile satisfying the boundary conditions at the wall and the matching conditions at the core and the boundary layer interface is introduced in the governing momentum integral equation. The indicated integration provides a relation for the boundary layer thickness for each axial position. The results for the pressure distribution, entrance length and the wall shear stresses are discussed for the various values of the parameters involved in the analysis. The analysis predicts that the entrance length increases as the stenosis grows and therefore the heart has to put in more energy into transporting blood. It seems that there is some inbuilt mechanism which keeps the entry region of every segment to a minimum in normal arteries at each junction. This length increases in pathological states leading to various types of hypertensive diseases due to the formation and growth of the stenosis.

AB  - An experimental analysis using three-dimensional laser Doppler velocimetery (LDV) measurements and computational analysis using the Reynolds stress model of the commercial code, FLUENT, were conducted to give a clear understanding on the structure of the tip leakage flow in a forward-swept axial-flow fan operating at the peak efficiency condition, and to emphasize the necessity of using an anisotropic turbulence model for the accurate prediction of the tip leakage vortex. The rolling-up of the tip leakage flow was initiated near the position of the maximum static pressure difference, which was located at approximately 12% axial tip chord downstream from the leading edge of the blade, and developed along the centerline of the pressure trough on the casing. A reverse flow between the blade tip and the casing due to the tip leakage vortex acted as a blockage on the through-flow. As a result, high momentum flux was observed below the tip leakage vortex. As the tip leakage vortex proceeded to the aft part of the blade passage, the strength of the tip leakage vortex decreased due to the strong interaction with the through-flow and the casing boundary layer, and the diffusion of the tip leakage vortex by high turbulence. Through the comparative study of turbulence models, it was clearly shown that an anisotropic turbulence model, e.g., Reynolds stress model, should be used to predict reasonably an anisotropic nature of the turbulent flow fields inside the tip leakage vortex. In comparison with LDV measurement data, the computed results predicted the complex viscous flow patterns inside the tip region in a reliable level.

AB  - Systematic investigations of pressure drop type oscillations and their thresholds for steam-water two-phase now in a uniformly heated helical coiled tube were reported. Experiments were conducted to obtain the critical conditions far the occurrence of pressure drop type dynamic oscillation, in a closed-circulation helical coiled tubing steam generator. The study has shown that different compressible volume positions corresponding to different oscillation initial boundaries as well as different oscillating amplitude and time periods. Moving compressible volume from the inlet of steam generator to the upstream can dramatically suppress the occurrence of pressure drop oscillation. Also, non-uniform heat flux distribution along evaporating channel could change oscillating boundaries significantly, especially when higher heat flux was subjected to the higher mass quality region. A study of pressure drop oscillation in various steam generator inclinations showed that gravity has little influence upon the oscillating boundaries. Based on the experimental observations, a set of new methods was firstly proposed to eliminate the occurrence of pressure drop oscillation, The further experiments for subcooled water flow and steam-water two-phase flow were also conducted to investigate the effects of pulsation upon transient heat transfer characteristics. The non-uniform property of local heat transfer with steady flow was also examined. The secondary flow mechanism and the effect of interaction between the flow oscillation and secondary flow were analyzed on the basis of the experimental data. Some new phenomena were observed and explained. A series of correlations were proposed for the average and local heat transfer coefficients both under steady and oscillatory flow conditions. The results showed that there were considerable variations in local and peripherally time-average Nusselt numbers for pulsating flow in a wide range of parameters.

AB  - Motivated by the recent experimental observation of noticeable features of dimplelike surface roughness patterns onthe hybrid fuel grain, the authors investigated a coldflowin a porouschamberwith surface massinjection through a large eddy simulation technique. The main purpose is to understand the role of turbulent structures in generating those irregular, isolated roughness patterns found on the fuel surface. Itwas noted that the structural feature of near- wall coherent vortices has been considerably altered by the application of wall injection, resulting in isolated cell-like contours of streamwise velocity distributed all over the horizontal planes close to the wall. This sudden change of contour shape is reminiscent of the roughness patterns observed in the accompanying experiment. The rapid evolution of the kinematical configuration of near-wall turbulence structures is believed to be caused by the effect of vertical momentum given at the wall as in the regression process.

AB  - Spatially periodic turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer in a channel with slit rectangular ribs mounted on one wall have been numerically investigated. A Reynolds stress model with wall function and a modified wall-related pressure- strain model for reducing the overestimation of turbulent kinetic energy at impingement/reattachment region was employed in the two-dimensional simulation. QUICK discretization scheme and nonstaggered grid system were used. The parameters fixed were rib height-to-duct height ratio of 0.17, rib width-to-height ratio of 0.76, rib pitch-to-height ratio of 10, and Reynolds number based on channel hydraulic diameter and bulk mean velocity of 2 ?? 10

Two critical ranges of ?? and three characteristics flow regimes are identified, which is similar to the experimental results reported by previous researchers for the hole-type perforated ribs except a smaller critical ?? for impermeability. The rationale for the difference in the critical ?? between the slit-type and hole-type perforated ribs is addressed in terms of effective pore diameters. From the variations of the friction loss, convective mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy, and negative pressure behind the perforated ribs with ??, that ?? = 44% attains the best thermal performance Nu

AB  - In the present study, direct numerical simulation of turbulent heat transfer in a channel flow has been carried out in order to investigate the characteristics of surface heat-flux fluctuations. The Reynolds numbers based on the friction velocity and the channel half width are 180, 395, 640 and 1020, and the molecular Prandtl numbers are 0.025 and 0.71. A local peak for Pr = 0.71 and large peaks for Pr = 0.025 appear in the spanwise-wavenumber power spectra at low wavenumbers, and these peaks become more significant with increasing Reynolds number. This suggests that the effect of large-scale structures extends even to the surface heat-flux fluctuations, and increases with increasing Reynolds number. In addition, it was found that the surface heat-flux fluctuations for Pr = 0.71 are mostly similar to the streamwise wall shear-stress fluctuations, while a noticeable dissimilarity can be seen in the large positive and negative fluctuations. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Direct numerical simulations of turbulent heat transfer in a channel flow are performed to investigate the effects of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers on higher-order turbulence statistics such as a turbulent Prandtl number and the budget for the dissipation rate of the temperature variance. The Reynolds numbers based on the friction velocity and the channel half width are 180 and 395, and the molecular Prandtl numbers Pr’s 0.71–10.0. Careful attention is paid to ensure accuracy of the higher-order statistics through the use of a high spatial resolution comparable to Batchelor length scale. The wall-asymptotic value of the turbulent Prandtl number is mostly independent of Reynolds number for the current range of Pr’s. The budget for the dissipation rate of the temperature variance has been computed, and the negligible effect of a Reynolds number on the sum of all source and sink terms in near-wall region in the current computational range is found. This result is quite similar to the one in the budget for the dissipation rate of turbulent energy. In addition, a priori test for existing models is also performed to assess the Pr dependence on the individual terms and their summations in the budget.

AB  - Purpose – In computational fluid dynamics for two-phase reactive flow of interior ballistic, the conventional schemes (MacCormack method, etc.) are known to introduce unphysical oscillations in the region where the gradient is high. This paper aims to improve the ability to capture the complex shock wave during the interior ballistic cycle. Design/methodology/approach – A two-phase flow model is established to describe the complex physical process based on a modified two-fluid theory. The solution of model is obtained including the following key methods: an approximate Riemann solver to construct upwind fluxes, the MUSCL extension to achieve high-order accuracy, a splitting approach to solve source terms, a self-adapting method to expand the computational domain for projectile motion and a control volume conservation method for the moving boundary. Findings – The paper is devoted to applying a high-resolution numerical method to simulate a transient two-phase reactive flow with moving boundary in guns. Several verification tests demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of this approach. Simulation of two-phase reaction flow with a projectile motion in a large-caliber gun shows an excellent agreement between numerical simulation and experimental measurements. Practical implications – This paper has implications for improving the ability to capture the complex physics phenomena of two-phase flow during interior ballistic cycle and predict the combustion details, such as the flame spreading, the formation of pressure waves and so on. Originality/value – This approach is reliable as a prediction tool for the understanding of the physical phenomenon and can therefore be used as an assessment tool for future interior ballistics studies.

AB  - Riblets are well-known as a passive mean for drag reduction in turbulent flow conditions, but their effectiveness for heat transfer is quite controversial. In this paper we present the numerical results for fully developed laminar and turbulent flow and heat transfer in a channel with triangular riblets. The turbulent study is performed by means of direct numerical simulation at a Reynolds number Re?? = 180 based on the wall-shear velocity, for a fluid with a Prandtl number Pr = 0.71. Four different ribbed channels are considered, under a constant heat flux boundary condition, and correspond to ridge angle ?? = 45?? and 60??, and riblet spacing s+ = 20 and s+ = 40. The results obtained, for the flow and turbulent quantities, are in good agreement with past experimental and numerical studies, and correctly reproduce drag reduction over the smaller s+ = 20 riblets and drag increase over the larger s+ = 40 riblets. The predicted heat transfer efficiency of riblets do not agree with some experimental results, and is below that of a flat plate for all the configurations. The conditions for heat transfer enhancement are discussed. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider the conjugate heat transfer from a fiat plate involving a turbulent plane wall jet. The bottom wall of the solid block is heated by a constant heat flux. Design/methodology/approach - High Reynolds number two-equation model (K-E) has been used for turbulence modeling. The parameters considered are the conductivity ratio of solid and fluid, the solid slab thickness and the Prandtl number. The Reynolds number considered is 15,000 because the flow becomes fully turbulent and then is independent of the Reynolds number. The range of parameters considered are: conductivity ratio = 1-1,000, solid slab thickness = 1-10 and Prandtl number = 0.01-100. Findings - The non-dimensional bottom surface temperature is high for high-Prandtl number fluid and vice versa. As conductivity ratio increases, it decreases whereas it increases with the increase in slab thickness. Similar trend is observed for the distribution of the interface temperature. The Nusselt number computed based on the interface temperature increases with Prandtl number. It is observed that for the range of parameters considered, local Nusselt number distribution superimposes with each other. The average heat flux at the interface has been computed and found to be equal with average heat flux at the bottom which ensures the overall heat balance. Originality/value - The study of conjugate heat transfer with a turbulent wall jet will be useful for cooling of heated body.

AB  - Haemodynamic factors, in particular wall shear stresses (WSSs) may have significant impact on growth and rupture of cerebral aneurysms. Without a means to measure WSS reliably in vivo, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations are frequently employed to visualise and quantify blood flow from patient-specific computational models. With increasing interest in integrating these CFD simulations into pretreatment planning, a better understanding of the validity of the calculations in respect to computation parameters such as volume element type, mesh size and mesh composition is needed. In this study, CFD results for the two most common aneurysm types (saccular and terminal) are compared for polyhedral- vs. tetrahedral-based meshes and discussed regarding future clinical applications. For this purpose, a set of models were constructed for each aneurysm with spatially varying surface and volume mesh configurations (mesh size range: 5119-258, 481 volume elements). WSS distribution on the model wall and point-based velocity measurements were compared for each configuration model. Our results indicate a benefit of polyhedral meshes in respect to convergence speed and more homogeneous WSS patterns. Computational variations of WSS values and blood velocities are between 0.84 and 6.3% from the most simple mesh (tetrahedral elements only) and the most advanced mesh design investigated (polyhedral mesh with boundary layer).

AB  - Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is applied to a bubbly two-phase turbulent flow in a horizontal channel at Re = 2 x 10(4) to investigate the turbulent shear stress profile which had been altered by the presence of bubbles. Streamwise and vertical velocity components of liquid phase are obtained using a shallow focus imaging method under backlight photography. The size of bubbles injected through a porous plate in the channel ranged from 0.3 to 1.5 mm diameter, and the bubbles show a significant backward slip velocity relative to liquid flow. After bubbles and tracer particles are identified by binarizing the image, velocity of each phase and void fraction are profiled in a downstream region. The turbulent shear stress, which consists of three components in the bubbly two-phase flow, is computed by analysis of PTV data. The result shows that the fluctuation correlation between local void fraction and vertical liquid velocity provides a negative shear stress component which promotes frictional drag reduction in the bubbly two-phase layer. The paper also deals with the source of the negative shear stress considering bubble's relative motion to liquid.

AB  - Three-dimensional simulations of laminar separated and reattached flow and heat trans-  fer over a blunt flat plate in a square channel are presented. Numerical calculations of  Navier-Stokes equations and energy equation are carried out using the finite difference  method. Results of three-dimensional calculation are compared with two-dimensional  ones and effects of the side walls are described. It is clarified from the present results that  the reattachment length increases with an increase of Reynolds number and the flow in the  recirculation region becomes three-dimensional. The reattachment line is curved by the  side wall effects. Two-dimensionality of the flow is reduced as Reynolds number increases.  The horseshoe-vortex formed near the side walls has great effects upon the heat transfer  in the redeveloping flow region. The separated shear layer around the center of plate  becomes unstable with a further increase of Reynolds number and the vortices are peri-  odically shed from the reattachment flow region. Such vortices exhibit a hairpin-like  structure and greatly influence the heat transfer.

AB  - An experimental analysis using three-dimensional laser Doppler velocimetery (LDV) measurements and computational analysis using the Reynolds stress model of the commercial code, FLUENT, were conducted to give a clear understanding on the structure of the tip leakage flow in a forward-swept axial-flow fan operating at the peak efficiency condition, and to emphasize the necessity of using an anisotropic turbulence model for the accurate prediction of the tip leakage vortex. The rolling-up of the tip leakage flow was initiated near the position of the maximum static pressure difference, which was located at approximately 12% axial tip chord downstream from the leading edge of the blade, and developed along the centerline of the pressure trough on the casing. A reverse flow between the blade tip and the casing due to the tip leakage vortex acted as a blockage on the through-flow. As a result, high momentum flux was observed below the tip leakage vortex. As the tip leakage vortex proceeded to the aft part of the blade passage, the strength of the tip leakage vortex decreased due to the strong interaction with the through-flow and the casing boundary layer, and the diffusion of the tip leakage vortex by high turbulence. Through the comparative study of turbulence models, it was clearly shown that an anisotropic turbulence model, e.g., Reynolds stress model, should be used to predict reasonably an anisotropic nature of the turbulent flow fields inside the tip leakage vortex. In comparison with LDV measurement data, the computed results predicted the complex viscous flow patterns inside the tip region in a reliable level.

AB  - Urban transportation planning and land-use policies play a pivotal role in every society and are the subjects of interest in many academic fields. Creating a tool that measures the benefits and costs associated with the built environment, which includes the surrounding land-use and transportation system, would allow decision makers to choose the best option available to them when deciding on those important issues. In addition to travel time, congestion, safety, energy, and environment, public health is an important subject that can be affected by a transportation system. The primary objective of this study is to develop models for different health-related variables including general health, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, asthma, and heart attack. This is to investigate the role of transportation, land-use, and the built environment variables along with demographic and socioeconomic factors on people?셲 health. The results of the analysis showed that increasing the transit use and decreasing the autouse have a significant positive impact on all the health variables except for asthma. It was found that every percent decrease in autouse would reduce the chance of obesity by 0.4%, high blood pressure by 0.3%, high blood cholesterol by 1.3%, and heart attack by 1%. In addition to the transit-oriented development, making the environment more pedestrian friendly could motivate people to be more physically active in their daily routines and have a healthier lifestyle.

AB  - Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;A longitudinal vortical structure is typically observed in near-wall turbulence. This vortical structure is elongated in the streamwise direction, though it is also tilted in the spanwise direction. The sense of this spanwise tilting is determined by the sign of the streamwise vorticity associated with the vortex, and longitudinal vortical structures with a different streamwise vorticity become asymmetric (mirror symmetric). The tilting must be due to the combined effects of the non-linear terms and mean spanwise vorticity associated with the mean shear. However, the detailed mechanism of the tilting is not well known. To study the tilting in detail, we performed direct numerical simulations of a homogeneous shear flow where the longitudinal vortical structures similar to those in the near-wall region are observed. In particular, the effects of spanwise system rotation as well as the Reynolds number on the vortical structure are studied. As a result, we found that spanwise system rotation has more marked effects on the vortical structure than the Reynolds number. When the system rotation is imposed in the same direction as the mean spanwise vorticity, the tilting is enhanced, while the system rotation of the opposite direction attenuates it. We also found that when the longitudinal vortical structure is tilted in the spanwise direction, it is sandwiched between the streamwise vorticity of the opposite sign. The cyclonic rotation enhances the streamwise vorticity of the opposite sign, though the longitudinal vortical structure at the center is attenuated. In the anticyclonic case, the streamwise vorticity of the opposite sign almost disappears and the longitudinal vortical structure is isolated from the surrounding flow.

AB  - Fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNSs) have been performed with a high-order spectral element method to study the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in a smooth circular pipe of radius R and axial length 25R in the tur- bulent flow regime at four different friction Reynolds numbers Reτ = 180, 360, 550 and 1,000. The new set of data is put into perspective with other simulation data sets, obtained in pipe, channel and boundary layer geometry. In particular, differences between different pipe DNS are highlighted. It turns out that the pressure is the vari- able which differs the most between pipes, channels and boundary layers, leading to significantly different mean and pressure fluctuations, potentially linked to a stronger wake region. In the buffer layer, the variation with Reynolds number of the inner peak of axial velocity fluctuation intensity is similar between channel and boundary layer flows, but lower for the pipe, while the inner peak of the pressure fluctuations show negligible differences between pipe and channel flows but is clearly lower than that for the boundary layer, which is the same behaviour as for the fluctuating wall shear stress. Finally, turbulent kinetic energy budgets are almost indistinguishable between the canonical flows close to the wall (up to y+ ≈ 100), while substantial differences are observed in production and dissipation in the outer layer. A clear Reynolds number dependency is documented for the three flow configurations.

AB  - Flow field measurements behind pipe entrance inserts called as flow conditioners in a mean flow Reynolds number range 547≤Re≤9000 are presented herein. A tube bundle, a Laws' perforated plate and an etoile were located at the entrance of a smooth circular pipe of inner diameter, D=26.6mm. The covered ranges of open area ratio, β and non-dimensional length, L/D were 0.49≤β≤0.74 and 0.123≤L/D≤2 respectively. The cross-sectional axial velocity u=u(r) profiles at the downstream stations of X/D=75,X/D=375,X/D=680 together with pressure losses δP are referred to determine the influence of utilized designs.The flow conditioners have a single performance characteristic expressed through a relationship of pressure loss coefficient K=K(Reβ) which provides a practical method for the calculation of time-averaged pressure loss, δP̄ in an average error margin of ±18%. The laminar flow inside the pipe without an insert in the range of Re<2450 is not fully developed sensed with u=u(r) profiles having a ±20% deviation from the Blasius profile for the lengths X/D<680. Meanwhile flow conditioners provide a fully developed laminar flow independent of Re and X observed in terms of downstream u=u(r) profiles with a better fit to the Blasius profile in a mean error margin of ±10%.The laminar flow control via flow conditioners is analyzed through a discussion in terms of the introduced local non-dimensional velocity parameters. The used methodology is based on the definition of entrance length Reynolds Number; ReX=(X/D)Re. The proposed equations "ReXβ=C" (where C is a constant) can be used for the estimation of settling distance of the flow conditioners and laminar entrance length. The experimental data are in conformity with the magnitudes of C=2.87×104 and C=3×105 with the corresponding error margins of ±4% and ±6% respectively. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the flow structures responsible for large local instantaneous deviations of the conventional momentum-heat transfer analogy and large fluctuations of the wall shear stress and the wall heat flux in a forced convection turbulent channel flow at low-Reynolds numbers (Re = 4570, Pr = 0.7). The analysis was carried out using a database obtained from a direct numerical simulation performed with a second-order finite volume code. The ensemble averaged velocity and temperature profiles and profiles of the turbulence intensities and turbulent heat fluxes agree well with direct numerical simulations available in the literature. When the flow was statistically fully developed, we recorded the time evolution of the velocities and temperatures near one wall of the channel. The near wall structures responsible for the extreme values of the deviations were educed by a conditional sampling technique. Results show that extreme values of the wall shear stress and wall heat transfer rates, as well as departures from the conventional analogy between momentum and heat transfer, occur within the high-speed streaks on the wall and are associated with fluctuations of the streamwise pressure gradient. These large fluctuations on the wall are produced by the combined effect of two quasi-parallel counterrotating streamwise vortices. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-eddy simulations (LES) of a vertical turbulent channel flow laden with a very large number of solid particles are performed. The motivation for this research is to get insight into fundamental aspects of co-current turbulent gas-particle flows, as encountered in riser reactors. The particle volume fraction equals about 1.3%, which is relatively high in the context of modern LES of two-phase flows. The channel flow simulations are based on large-eddy approximations of the compressible NavierStokes equations in a porous medium. The EulerLagrangian method is adopted, which means that for each individual particle an equation of motion is solved. The method incorporates four-way coupling, i.e., both the particle-fluid and particleparticle interactions are taken into account. The results are compared to single-phase channel flow in order to investigate the effect of the particles on turbulent statistics. The present results show that due to particlefluid interactions the mean fluid profile is flattened and the boundary layer is thinner. Compared to single-phase turbulent flow, the streamwise turbulence intensity of the gas phase is increased, while the normal and spanwise turbulence intensities are reduced. This finding is generally consistent with existing experimental data. The four-way coupled simulations are also compared with two-way coupled simulations, in which the inelastic collisions between particles are neglected. The latter comparison clearly demonstrates that the collisions have a large influence on the main statistics of both phases. In addition, the four-way coupled simulations contain stronger coherent particle structures. It is thus essential to include the particleparticle interactions in numerical simulations of two-phase flow with volume fractions around one percent.

AB  - Direct numerical simulations have been performed to study the effect of an oscillating segment of the wall on a turbulent boundary layer flow. Two different oscillation amplitudes with equal oscillation period have been used, which allows a direct comparison between a relatively weak and strong forcing of the flow. The weaker forcing results in 18% drag reduction while the stronger forcing, with twice the amplitude, yields 29% drag reduction. The downstream development of the drag reduction is compared with earlier simulations and experiments. In addition, a simulation with identical oscillation parameters as in previous numerical and experimental investigations allows for an estimation of the effect of the Reynolds number on the drag reduction.Reductions in the Reynolds stresses and the important role that the edge of the Stokes layer has is explained.An estimation of the idealized power consumption shows that a positive energy budget is only possible for the weaker wall velocity case.Spatial and temporal transients are investigated and a transformation between spatial and temporal coordinates via a convection velocity is shown to facilitate a comparison between the two transients in a consistent manner. The streamwise shear exhibits a similar monotonic behavior in the spatial and temporal transients, while the non-monotinic temporal transient of the longitudinal Reynolds stress has no counterpart in the spatial development. Furthermore, the evolution in time of the spanwise Reynolds stress is very similar to previously reported channel flow data.The instantaneous spanwise velocity profile (only averaged in the homogeneous spanwise direction) will for the first time be presented from a boundary layer over an oscillating wall, and comparisons with the analytical solution to the laminar Navier-Stokes equations show very good agreement. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Numerical calculations of a lifted H2=N2 turbulent jet flame in a  vitiated coflow of hot gases are presented. The calculations are per-  formed using Magnussen's Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) for tur-  bulent combustion, and are an extension to previously reported EDC  modeling results presented by Cabra et al. (2002). Four dif ferent tur-  bulence models are employed to investigate in more detail the turbu-  lence modeling ef fect on the EDC combustion model with detailed  chemistry. A series of simulations are presented that indicate the  extent to which turbulence models influence the predicted lift-of f  height with the EDC combustion model. Several flow conditions  were tested. For all calculations, EDC predicts more lift-of f by using  the standard k-e model than by using Reynolds-stress-equation (RSE)  models, whereas a modified k-e model predicts less lift-of f than the  RSE models. The reason for the lower predicted lift-of f with the  modified k-e model is because a modified turbulence Prandtl or  Schmidt number in the scalar equations in the modified k-e model  allows an earlier mixing of the hot coflow with the fuel jet. All models  overpredict the lift-of f height for the standard flow conditions.  Recent experiments and numerical calculations by others have shown  that the vitiated coflow flame is extremely sensitive to variations in  the coflow temperature. The present calculations show that this sensi-  tivity is captured by the EDC combustion model, however to a smaller  degree than that previously reported. Calculations with variations in  coflow temperature and jet flow velocity indicate that for each flow con-  dition, the various turbulence models predict the same percentage  increase or decrease in lift-off height. These EDC calculations show that  the turbulence model effect on the EDC predicted lift-off height is  important and that a better flame structure is predicted with the RSE  model by Jones and Musonge than with the other turbulence models.

AB  - In a shear flow, a small sphere may experience a lift force due to fluid inertia. Most previous workers assumed that the particle was stationary so that they could treat the fluid motion as steady. In spite of this, the results of previous analyses have generally been applied to problems in which particles move in an unsteady fashion. This paper presents the results of singular perturbation calculations of the lift on a sphere in a linear shear flow. The velocity of the sphere oscillates sinusoidally in time. Although the problem is idealized, the results provide some physical understanding of the effects of unsteadiness and the frequency regime in which one may assume quasisteady conditions.

AB  - The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent heat transfer in a channel flow has been carried out to investigate the Reynolds and Prandtl number effects on the turbulent heat transport. The configuration is a fully developed turbulent channel flow with uniform heating from both walls. The Reynolds numbers based on the friction velocity and the channel half width are 180 and 395, and the molecular Prandtl numbers are 0.025, 0.2 and 0.71. The statistical quantities such as the temperature variance, turbulent heat fluxes, turbulent Prandtl number and the time scale ratio are obtained and the effects of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers are examined. Budget terms of the temperature variance and the turbulent heat fluxes are also calculated. In addition, the instantaneous flow and thermal fields are visualized in order to investigate the structures of streaks and vortices.

AB  - Heat transfer in a channel of rough wall is simulated in this work. Two kinds of roughness are considered, i.e., one assumes sand-grain roughness based on roughness model and the other regularly arranged two-dimensional ribs. No models other than sand-grain roughness implemented in the simulation. For the sake of computational load, one wall is assumed to be smooth and the global Reynolds number ReT based on mean friction velocity and half channel width is 150. Mean flow property of velocity and thermal fields are found to be little influenced by the property of roughness elements but depends on total drag, except for in the layer close to the wall where direct interference with roughness elements manifests itself. Similarity of thermal field with velocity one is confirmed for the low Prandtl number flows considered in the work. The mixing is found to be controlled by large scale motion which is inherent to the logarithmic layer, getting closer to the wall. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The concepts of activity based costing and material flow cost accounting are explained as well as where to get the necessary data from stock management and production planning systems. The last issues dealt with are application for investment appraisal, budgeting and benchmarking. Danisco, a global supplier to the food industry, uses EMA as a tool primarily to benchmark production sites, which are divers from a geographical and production process point of view in order to demonstrate differences and similarities.

AB  - Particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements near a curved boundary usually require efforts to deal with low tracer density, high shear gradient and wall reflection. To resolve these difficulties, we presented a near-wall measurement technique named interfacial PIV (IPIV) that could return a tangential velocity component and a tangential component of wall gradient [Nguyen TD, Wells J, Nguyen C. Wall shear stress measurement of near-wall flow over inclined and curved boundaries by stereo interfacial particle image velocimetry. International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow 2010;31(3):442-9]. In this paper, we introduce an extension of IPIV to measure the tangential and wall-normal velocity components. This extension allows IPIV to obtain three velocity components when IPIV is applied to stereoscopic PIV images of flows over inclined and curved boundaries. The performance of IPIV is validated against a particle image distortion (PID) technique using synthetic images generated from a direct numerical simulation velocity field of a turbulent flow over a wavy wall. Results show that IPIV is more accurate than PID in the near-wall velocity measurement. Practical applications of IPIV to experimental images of open flume tests with a wavy wall and a backward-facing step are described. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The airflow and dispersion of a pollutant in a complex urban area of Beijing, China, were numerically examined by coupling a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model with a mesoscale weather model. The models used were Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software package and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. OpenFOAM was firstly validated against wind-tunnel experiment data. Then, the WRF model was integrated for 42 h starting from 0800 LST 08 September 2009, and the coupled model was used to compute the flow fields at 1000 LST and 1400 LST 09 September 2009. During the WRF-simulated period, a high pressure system was dominant over the Beijing area. The WRF-simulated local circulations were characterized by mountain valley winds, which matched well with observations. Results from the coupled model simulation demonstrated that the airflows around actual buildings were quite different from the ambient wind on the boundary provided by the WRF model, and the pollutant dispersion pattern was complicated under the influence of buildings. A higher concentration level of the pollutant near the surface was found in both the step-down and step-up notches, but the reason for this higher level in each configurations was different: in the former, it was caused by weaker vertical flow, while in the latter it was caused by a downward-shifted vortex. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the coupled WRF-OpenFOAM model is an important tool that can be used for studying and predicting urban flow and dispersions in densely built-up areas.

AB  - With the increasing denitration efficiency of SCR (Selective Catalytic Redn.) system, the flue gas velocity field at an ammonia-injection grid becomes more important in uniform flow of SCR system and mixing technol.  With the SCR system in a high efficiency power plant served as an study object, the influences of ten typical changes of the flue gas velocity field at the AIG on the uniform flow and reducing agent mixing performance in the SCR system of the power plant were analyzed by using a SCR system numerical model which has been verified by a cold state model.  It has been found that for the SCR system with a high denitration efficiency, any change to the velocity field at the AIG exercises a great influence on the distribution of ammonia-nitrogen ratio at the interface of a catalyzer inlet and also a definite influence on the velocity field at the inlet interface.  In a design process, the control of the inhomogeneity of the flow speed at the AIG can enhance the quality of the uniform flow and mixing in the SCR system.  In a high-efficiency SCR system in which a relatively good control over the inhomogeneity of the flow speed at the AIG has been achieved, with an increase of the inhomogeneity, the non-uniformity of the ammonia-nitrogen ratio at the catalyzer inlet will be increased.  The velocity field at the AIG and that of the catalyzer have a similarity. [on SciFinder (R)]

AB  - The concentration of pulp fibers in three-dimensional fully developed turbulent channel flow is investigated by two numerical methods: A random-walk simulation and large eddy simulation (LES). For the random-walk simulation, the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved for the mean flow fields with Reynolds number 65,000 (based on average channel velocity and channel half-width). The individual components of the fluctuation velocities are obtained by curve-fitting existing experimental data for the whole channel width. The LES is performed at Reynolds number ReT (based on friction velocity and channel half-width) of 2820, which is close to the flow condition used for the random-walk simulation. A flexible fiber model is used to simulate the fiber motion. A general wall model is developed to deal with the fiber interaction with the walls. Both simulated results show that the concentration increases linearly near the wall and becomes approximately constant farther from the wall, in reasonable agreement with experimental observations. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - An interferometric study and a numerical simulation are presented of the combined process of the bulk turbulent convection and the dynamic of a vapor bubble which is formed in the superheated boundary layer of a subcooled flowing liquid, in order to determine the heat transfer to the flowing subcooled liquid. In this investigation focus has been given on a single vapor bubble at a defined cavity site to provide reproducible conditions. In the experimental study single bubbles were generated at a single artificial cavity by means of a CO2-laser as a spot heater at a uniformly heated wall of a vertical rectangular channel with water as the test fluid. The experiments were performed at various degrees of subcooling and mass flow rates. The bubble growth and the temporal decrease of the bubble volume were captured by means of the high-speed cinematography. The thermal boundary layer and the temperature field at the phase-interface between fluid and bubble were visualized by means of the optical measurement method holographic interferometry with a high temporal and spatial resolution, and thus the local and temporal heat transfer could be quantified. The experimental results form a significant data basis for the description of the mean as well as the local heat transfer as a function of the flow conditions. According to the experimental configuration and the obtained data the numerical simulations were performed. A numerical method has been developed to simulate the influence of single bubbles on the surrounding fluid which is based on a Lagrangian approach to describe the motion of the bubbles. The method is coupled to a large-eddy simulations by the body force term which is locally evaluated based on the density field. The obtained experimental data correspond well with the numerical predictions, both of which demonstrate the thermo- and fluiddynamic characteristics of the interaction between the vapor bubble and the subcooled liquid. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics modelling of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is commonly simplified to consider a two-dimensional axisymmetric problem. To determine the validity of this assumption, a Floquet stability analysis was employed to predict the conditions under which an axisymmetric aneurysmal flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric instabilities. Dimensions of the model were selected to be consistent with a high-risk aneurysm in the human abdominal aorta. In particular, the model consisted of an elliptical bulge defining the aneurysm, and both upstream and downstream artery sections. A sinusoidal time-varying parabolic velocity profile was input upstream, with Womersley number α = 16.9 (representing a heart rate of 70 beats per minute when artery diameter D = 22.7 mm and kinematic viscosity v = 3.3x10 -6 m 2 s). A Reynolds number range relevant to aneurysms in large arteries was examined, with the critical Reynolds number for non-axisymmetric transition and the corresponding azimuthal wavelength found to be Re CRIT = 610 and λ = π (azimuthal mode number m = 2). The maximum vorticity at the vessel wall was found to occur at the distal end of the aneurysm bulge. The pulsatile flow frequency was also varied, with the frequency dependence on Re CRIT and λ being established.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to study by direct numerical simulation the effect of a shear-thickening behaviour of a surfactant solution, on the fluid flow, and especially on the friction coefficient in a plane channel flow. A three-dimensional model named Surfactant Drag Reduction Study (SUDRES3D) [S. Guillou, R. Makhloufi, Direct numerical simulation of an incompressible channel flow in presence of an additive, in: J. Sobota, R. Verhoeven (Eds.), Proc. 11th International Conference Transport and Sedimentation of Solid Particles, AXA, Wroclam, 2002, pp. 151-158] was developed to apply to DNS. The shear-thickening rheological behaviour of an aqueous surfactant solution (Ethoquad O/12 (500 ppm) + NaSal (330 ppm)), studied previously by Usui et al. [H. Usui, T. Itoh, T. Saeki, On pipe diameter effects in surfactant drag-reducing pipe flows, Rheol. Acta 37 (1998) 122-128], is modelled here by a combination of two shear-thinning Carreau laws, which is later referred to as composed law. The calculations are performed first separately with the two shear-thinning Carreau laws and the composed law for different Reynolds numbers either in laminar and turbulent flows. The results are compared between them. It appears that for the set of parameters used, corresponding to the experimental data, the shear-thickening has no major effect on the wall friction and then no Drag Reduction occurs. Secondly, some calculations are performed with a chosen set of parameters. They show that such kind of behaviour may have a positive effect on the friction coefficient and a drag reduction phenomenon appears, but under restrictive conditions. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, a large eddy simulation based on the lattice Boltzmann framework is carried out to simulate the heat transfer in a turbulent channel flow, in which the temperature can be regarded as a passive scalar. A double multiple relaxation time (DMRT) thermal lattice Boltzmann model is employed. While applying DMRT, a multiple relaxation time D3Q19 model is used to simulate the flow field, and a multiple relaxation time D3Q7 model is used to simulate the temperature field. The dynamic subgrid stress model, in which the turbulent eddy viscosity and the turbulent Prandtl number are dynamically computed, is integrated to describe the subgrid effect. Not only the strain rate but also the temperature gradient is calculated locally by the non-equilibrium moments. The Reynolds number based on the shear velocity and channel half height is 180. The molecular Prandtl numbers are set to be 0.025 and 0.71. Statistical quantities, such as the average velocity, average temperature, Reynolds stress, root mean square (RMS) velocity fluctuations, RMS temperature and turbulent heat flux are obtained and compared with the available data. The results demonstrate great reliability of DMRT-LES in studying turbulence. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An experimental study of the initial flow field downstream of a step change in surface roughness is presented. The roughness length of the downstream surface was approximately tenfold that of the upstream roughness and, unlike all previous studies, attention was concentrated on the roughness sublayer region beneath the inertial (log-law) region. The experiments were conducted at a boundary layer Reynolds number of about 6 x 10(4) (based on layer thickness and free-stream velocity) and around a longitudinal location where the (downstream) roughness length, z(o2),was about 1% of the boundary-layer thickness at the roughness change point. The thickness of the roughness sublayer was found for the two roughness. It was observed that the vertical profiles of mean velocity and turbulence characteristics started to show similarity after about 160(z02) downstream of the roughness change. The presence of a shear stress overshoot is shown to depend strongly on the precise location (with respect to the roughness elements) at which the measurements are made and the thickness of the equilibrium layer is shown to be very sensitive to the way it is defined. It is demonstrated that the growing equilibrium layer has first to encompass the roughness sublayer before any thickness of inertial sublayer can be developed. It follows that, in some practical cases, like flows across some urban environments, the latter (log-law) region may never exist at all.

AB  - This paper reports on direct and large-eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent flows using the lattice-Boltzmann scheme for the discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. It is divided into two parts. The first part deals with direct simulation of fully developed turbulent channel flow with heat transfer in order to check the performance of our solver. It is shown that the present numerical results agree well with the numerical results reported by Kim et al. (1987). The second part deals with large-eddy simulation (LES) of the turbulent flow in a baffled stirred tank reactor. This kind of equipment is frequently used in the (petro)chemical industry for mixing applications and is, therefore, of direct practical relevance. Large-eddy simulation is a powerful tool to study such flows, as it accounts in a natural way for the unsteady and quasi-periodic behavior of these flows. The results of our first attempt to simulate this flow by means of modeling the impact of the mechanical impeller on the flow field via a varying force field in space and time, reveal a fair agreement with available experimental data. In accordance with measurements, it is shown that the thickness of the impeller blades plays an important role for the motion of the fluid in the vicinity of the impeller. In conclusion, the present application of LES to this engineering flow problem clearly shows the potential of LES as a tool to investigate turbulent flows in industrial applications of practical importance.

AB  - A numerical investigation aimed at understanding the flow and heat transfer characteristics of pulsating turbulent flow in an abrupt pipe expansion was carried out. The flow patterns are classified by four parameters; the Reynolds number, the Prandtl number, the abrupt expansion ratio and the pulsation frequency. The influence of these parameters on the flow was studied in the range 104,Re , 5 £ 104, 0.7,Pr , 7.0, 0.2 , d/D , 0.6 and 5 , f , 35. It was found that the influence of pulsation on the mean time-averaged Nusselt number is insignificant (around 10 per cent increase) for fluids having a Prandtl number less than unity. This effect is appreciable (around 30 per cent increase) for fluids having Prandtl number greater than unity. For all pulsation frequencies, the variation in the mean time-averaged Nusselt number, maximum Nusselt number and its location with Reynolds number and diameter ratio exhibit similar characteristics to steady flows.

For the branched samples an abnormal late co-elution of large and small macromolecules manifests itself as an abnormal re-increase of the molar mass and the radius of gyration values detected with multi angle light scattering at high elution volumes in SEC. The late co-elution of small and large macromolecules cannot be explained by the SEC mechanism alone. The influence of several experimental parameters on the late co-elution was studied. It was found that the type of SEC column and the flow rate have a significant influence. The late eluting part of the sample was fractionated and separated by HT-SEC- and HT-AF4-MALS. The different results of both methods have been discussed with the aim to find possible explanations for the late elution. The experiments indicate that especially large branched structures show an increased tendency for the phenomenon.

The tool is not based on models and flow quantification insofar as managers are not willing to share data and yet lack information concerning the impacts they could withstand in case of disruption. Thus the method is based on practitioners’ knowledge and enables the construction of a common representation of the urban system. We explain with a Parisian case study how it can be used and how the interdependencies identification contributes to the improvement of urban resilience. Indeed, resilience to disturbances requires an integrated management of all systems impacted and helps decision-makers to plan for reducing losses.

AB  - Recently Lee and Balachandar proposed analytically-based expressions for drag and lift coefficients for a spherical particle moving on a flat wall in a linear shear flow at finite Reynolds number. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these expressions, we have conducted direct numerical simulations of a rolling particle for shear Reynolds number up to 100. We assume that the particle rolls on a horizontal flat wall with a small gap separating the particle from the wall (L= 0.505) and thus avoiding the logarithmic singularity. The influence of the shear Reynolds number and the translational velocity of the particle on the hydrodynamic forces of the particle was investigated under both transient and the final drag-free and torque-free steady state. It is observed that the quasi-steady drag and lift expressions of Lee and Balachandar provide good approximation for the terminal state of the particle motion ranging from perfect sliding to perfect rolling. With regards to transient particle motion in a wall-bounded shear flow it is observed that the above validated quasi-steady drag and lift forces must be supplemented with appropriate wall-corrected added-mass and history forces in order to accurately predict the time-dependent approach to the terminal steady state. Quantitative comparison with the actual particle motion computed in the numerical simulations shows that the theoretical models quite effective in predicting rolling/sliding motion of a particle in a wall-bounded shear flow at moderate Re. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fluid flow and heat transfer from a stationary cube placed in a uniform flow is studied numerically. The three-dimensional unsteady Navier Stokes and energy equations are solved using higher order temporal and spatial discretizations. Computations are carried out for a Reynolds number range of 50-400. At Re = 218, the symmetry seen at Re = 216 breaks down in one of the orthogonal planes while remains symmetric on the other thus showing a planar symmetry. The flow experiences a Hopf bifurcation at a Reynolds number between 265 and 270 and becomes unsteady. The thermal field also shows all the transitions same as those of flow transitions. The drag coefficient decreases while the heat transfer shows an increasing trend with Reynolds number. The transition from a steady to an unsteady flow does not show any significant increase in the heat transfer. Both the flow and thermal fields show multiple frequencies at high Reynolds number and the number of frequencies increases with the increase in Reynolds number. The instantaneous flow and temperature field are seen to deviate from planar symmetry at Re = 400. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent investigations of laminar flow control for swept-wing boundary- layer flows provide promising results with respect to crossflow-transition delay using a technique called pinpoint suction. Strong, localized suction through holes accu- rately positioned with respect to the crossflow-vortex position can directly weaken the growth of secondary instabilities that are responsible for the final laminar break- down. With our incompressible code N3D extremely resolved grids in wall-normal direction have to be used to obtain numerical convergence. In order to confirm the results with such strong, localized suction, a single suction hole has been simulated in a Blasius boundary layer with the N3D code and additionally with our compress- ible code NS3D. Results from grid studies carried out for both codes as well as a comparison of the compressible/incompressible results are provided. Incompressible simulations with various pinpoint suction scenarios in the swept-wing flow show the application of successful pinpoint suction. Performance data for both codes focusing on a comparison of the NEC SX-8/SX-9 conclude this report.

AB  - Turbulent flow in a channel with transverse rib roughness on one wall is investigated by large-eddy simulation (LES). The spacing of the roughness elements is varied to reproduce the so-called d- and k-type roughness, and an intermediate roughness between the two. The time-mean and instantaneous flows are analyzed. The LES results agree with the rather limited laboratory observations in flows with rib roughness, and provide new insights into the effects of roughness on the mean flow as well as the turbulence structure. In d-type roughness, the outer flow almost rides over the roughness layer, in the mean, with the separation eddies confined to the gaps between the ribs. For intermediate roughness, between the d-type and k-type, the mean separation region is about the same size as the cavity between the ribs, but the outer flow is affected by large turbulent eddies emanating from the roughness layer. For k-type roughness, separation and reattachment occur between two adjoining ribs, much larger and more frequent eddies are thrown into the outer flow, resulting in strong interaction between the roughness layer and the outer flow. Time and space averaged velocity profiles show the well-known downward shift of the semi-logarithmic portion of the law of the wall. This result is quite surprising in view of the grossly varying spatial structure of the instantaneous flow.

Properties of CNT such as the type of functionalisation, charge density, and the dispersibility profile are expected to modulate CNT cellular uptake and toxicity profile in vitro. The assay described here allows for rapid screening of CNT cellular uptake in vitro and assessing the acute cytotoxicity simultaneously. CNT cellular uptake is measured qualitatively by light scattering analysis without differentiating between cell binding and internalisation of the CNT by the cells. In addition, flow cytometry is used to combine light scattering analysis with flow cytometry-based Annexin V/propidium iodide assay to measure the cytotoxicity. This assay is rapid, reliable, and allows for comparative analysis between various types of CNT studied.

AB  - The present study provides a comparison between the flow pattern around two circular piers in tandem and a single pier set up on a moderately rough flat bed in a laboratory flume. Velocities are measured by an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The contours of the time-averaged velocity components, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulence intensities and turbulence kinetic energy at different planes are presented. Streamlines and vectors are used to study the flow features. The analysis of power spectra around the piers is also presented. The results show that the presence of downstream pier changes the flow structure to a great extent, particularly in the near-wake region. Within the gap between the two piers, a stronger and substantial upflow is shaped. However, a weaker transverse-deflection is formed in comparison with that in the single pier. Near the bed, the velocity of flow approaching the downstream pier decreases to 0.2-0.3 times of the approach mean velocity (U (0)) due to the sheltering effect of the upstream pier. In the wake of downstream pier, the flow structure is completely different from the one in the wake of single pier. In comparison with the single pier, the values of turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence intensities show a considerable decrease around the tandem piers. In tandem piers, the high values of turbulence characteristics are found near the downstream pier. There is a recirculation zones just upstream of the sheltered pier close to the bed and another behind that pier near the free surface. The results show a decrease in the strength of vortical structure in the wake of tandem piers in comparison with single pier. It is shown that the formation of flow with different Reynolds number along the flow depth due to the effect of bed roughness, as well as pier spacing, can influence the type of flow regime of tandem case. In addition to enhancing the flow structure indulgence, the present detailed measurements can also be used for verification of numerical models.

AB  - Fluctuating wall shear stress under turbulent boundary layer (TBL) excitation is studied in this experimental investigation. A cylindrical shell with a smooth internal surface is subjected to TBL excitation from water in fully developed pipe flow at 6.1 ms. The vibration response of the cylinder is used to inversely determine low-wavenumber TBL shear stress levels. Both the cross-flow and streamwise directions are examined using directionally uncoupled low-order cylinder modes in the circumferential and axial directions. These data address a critical gap in available literature regarding experimental low-wavenumber shear stress data. The low-wavenumber shear stress levels in both the cross-flow and streamwise directions are determined to be roughly 10 dB higher than those of normal pressure. As is the case for various models of TBL pressure, these measurements suggest that a nearly constant value for normalized shear stress at low wavenumber is valid over a broad range of frequencies. A simple wavenumber white model form established for low-wavenumber TBL surface pressure is also shown to be appropriate for shear stress.

AB  - Large landslides are often characterised by complex activity resulting from their ability to suddenly change behaviour. In fact, these landslides can pass from a slump to a flow characterised by relatively high mobility. This characteristics is a cause of extremely high severity and hazard in areas affected by such phenomena. An interesting case of a large slide in glacial deposits, which occurred in 1993 in the Valcamonica of the Italian Alps, is presented. Different approaches both to characterise the coarse frictional materials involved in the slide and to model the slide initiation and its evolution are adopted. The initial slide mass had a volume of almost 2 Mm3 and after its initial sliding motion along the slope, flowed for about 7 km down the main valley stream. Voight's method has been used to analyse measured slope displacements recorded for a few years before the slope failure. This analysis provided evidence that different times of failure could have been predicted beforehand by rigorous examination of the available data. Laboratory tests and image/processing techniques have been performed to characterise the landslide material as resembling a "bimrock" (block in matrix material). Slope stability analyses have been performed and a dynamic modelling method has been tested on the flow by comparing its results to those obtained by analysis of eyewitness statements and field observations on the mudline left by the flow. Finally, existing empirical approaches for hazard assessment on an alluvial fan have been applied and modified to produce a hazard zonation map for the alluvial fan area by considering maximum expected discharge, local geometry of the channel and the possibility of channel occlusion and subsequent avulsion. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The nature of supersonic, turbulent, adiabatic-wall flow in a square duct is investigated experimentally over a development length 0 < x/D < 20 for a uniform flow with a Mach 3.9 condition at the duct inlet. The experiments were conducted in a duct that was designed specifically to minimize wave effects and nozzle-induced distortion in the flow. Total pressure contours and local skin friction coefficient distributions show that the flow develops in a manner similar to that observed for the incompressible case. In particular, undulations exist in total pressure contours within the cross plane and in transverse skin friction coefficient distributions, indicating the presence of a well-defined secondary flow superimposed upon the primary flow. The results are analyzed to show that local law-of-the-wall behavior extends well into the corner region, which implies that wall functions conventionally applied in two-equation-type turbulence models, when suitably defined for compressible flow, may also be applied to supersonic streamwise corner flows.

AB  - Turbulent open-channel flow over a two-dimensional dune is studied using an established large-eddy simulation code. The free surface is approximated as a shear free boundary. Turbulence statistics and instantaneous flow structures are examined. Numerical results from two computational grids agree with each other, and are also in good agreement with recently obtained experimental data. The mean velocity profiles show significant changes along the dune and there is no region that conforms to the standard law-of-the-wall. Profiles of the Reynolds stresses show distinct peaks marking the shear layer that originates from flow separation at the dune crest. Secondary peaks found further from the dune are ascribed to the shear layer over the upstream dune. Details of the separated flow and development of the flow after reattachment are well predicted. Quadrant analysis of the Reynolds shear stress shows that turbulent ejections dominate the near-wall motions. Complex water surface flow structures are visualized.

AB  - Flow patterns for adiabatic vertical downward air-water flow in an 8.8. mm diameter channel have been studied. In particular, the influence of the inlet device, the flow history and the development length on the flow pattern have been investigated and assessed. Test results with two inlet devices (highly mixed and unmixed) indicate that the inlet device has a major influence on the flow pattern transitions. Furthermore, the transition boundaries between different flow regimes have been found to depend strongly on the flow's development length, and display hysteresis effects. Not surprisingly, no existing flow pattern map worked well versus the current observations, nor did they agree with one another, thus pointing the need to better characterize the test section inlet geometry, the influence of the test length and the test procedure to obtain genuine flow pattern observations. Presently, it can be concluded that in each flow pattern region there are important differences in the actual flow structures. A future mechanistic flow pattern map should then not only contain flow pattern transition lines but also physical characteristics which describe the flow regime and inlet device effects. This was qualitatively done in this study by superimposing on the flow pattern maps frames which illustrate the characteristics of the flow for two different inlet devices. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an indigenous three-dimensional computational code and apply it to compare flow and heat transfer characteristics for inline and staggered arrangement of circular tubes in a tube bundle. Design/methodology/approach - A finite-volume based computational code is developed to solve the momentum and energy equations for flow through a three-dimensional rectangular channel and past built-in tube bundles having inline and staggered arrangement. The approach is based on SIMPLE algorithm. The basic conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved over a body-fitting grid on the physical domain to obtain the flow and temperature fields. Findings - Heat transfer and pressure drop are compared for inline and staggered tube arrangements in a tube bundle over range of Reynolds numbers 300 ≤ Re ≤ 800. Results are validated suitably against those available in literature. Research implications - Tube-fin heat exchangers with continuous fins on a tube array are commonly used in air-conditioning industry and in air-cooled condensers of power plants. The flow structure within the finned tube bank is complex due to the presence of a circular tube, which causes flow acceleration over the fin surface and flow separation on the back side of the tube resulting in low velocity wake region. The present study provides a better understanding of flow behavior and heat transfer for inline and staggered arrangement of tube bundles in tube-fin heat exchangers at different Reynolds numbers. Originality/value - A numerical code based on finite volume method has been developed and used for computations to predict heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics for flow past inline and staggered arrangement of circular tubes. Predictions are made from the computed results about suitability of staggered/inline tube arrangements in a given range of Reynolds number. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The development of wall shear stress in concave surface boundary layer flows in the presence of Görtler vortices was experimentally studied by means of hot-wire measurements. The wavelengths of the vortices were preset by thin vertical perturbation wires so to produce the most amplified wavelengths. Three different vortex wavelengths of 12, 15, and 20 mm were considered, and near-wall velocity measurements were carried out to obtain the “linear” layers of velocity profiles in the boundary layers. The wall shear stress coefficient $C_f$ was estimated from the velocity gradient of the “linear” layer. The streamwise developments of boundary layer displacement and momentum thickness at both upwash and downwash initially follow the Blasius (laminar boundary layer) curve up to a certain streamwise location. Further downstream, they depart from the Blasius curve such that they increase at upwash and decrease at downwash before finally converge to the same value due to the increased mixing as a consequence of transition to turbulence. The spanwise-averaged wall shear stress coefficient $\bar{C}_f$, which initially follows the Blasius curve, increases well above the local turbulent boundary layer value further downstream due to the nonlinear effect of Görtler instability and the secondary instability modes. Three different regions are identified based on the streamwise development of $\bar{C}_f$, namely linear, nonlinear, and transition to turbulence regions. The onset of nonlinear region is defined as the streamwise location where the $\bar{C}_f$ begins to depart from the Blasius curve. In the nonlinear region, the spanwise distribution of $C_f$ at the downwash becomes narrower, and there is no inflection point found further downstream.

AB  - According to the 2007 world demographic revision report of the United Nations, urban areas are expected to absorb 60% of the world's population by 2030. Developed countries have experienced the effect of urban development on their water resources since the Second World War and today think about alternative techniques and management rules to protect them. Solutions are developed under the scope of the resilience concept to cope with global change effects, i.e. both land-use and climate changes. We deal here with the consequences and the way to get quantitative evidence on how urban development can change flood and low flow regimes. We also address how on-site rainwater retention can help to mitigate such effects. This paper is connected with the paper entitled "Flood risk mitigation using dry reservoirs in a global change perspective" presented by Radojevic et al. (2010b).

AB  - The effect of a negative free-stream mean-shear velocity distribution on the boundary layer development on a flat plate with a semi-circular leading edge is studied experimentally and computationally. The geometry is the same as in the T3L test case of the ERCOFTAC Special Interest Group on Transition. The existence of a negative shear is related to the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent through separation. The flow investigated here has the same general characteristics as the one presented in a recent work by the authors, Palikaras et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 23 (2002) 455-470], where the boundary layer development has been studied under free-stream conditions of uniform and positive mean-shear velocity distributions. The negative shear flow in the core region of the wind tunnel has a value ?????/???y = -27.7 s-1, which is the opposite to the case examined by Palikaras et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 23 (2002) 455-470]. In the first part of the paper, a detailed description of the flow is given. The measured quantities are presented, discussed and compared with the computational analysis in order to obtain a complete picture of the investigated flow. For the computations, the non-linear k-?? model of Craft et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 17 (1996) 108-115] is used, and satisfactory predictions are reported. In the second part, a detailed comparison of the results with the cases of uniform and positive mean-shear velocity inlet distribution is carried out. In the case of negative mean velocity the separated boundary layer leads to a larger reverse flow region than the two other cases. A relation is observed between the location of the stagnation point at the leading edge and the presence or absence of shear. When mean shear is present, depending on the sign, there is a movement of the stagnation point away from the symmetry line of the flat plate and it is believed that this is the driving mechanism that affects the boundary layer development and the longitudinal size of the reverse flow region. This remark is supported by the observation that for all the three cases studied, the longitudinal RMS distribution above the reverse flow region and in the free-stream region has the same values. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - A system for precision measurement of fluid velocity is developed and applied to determine the laminar flow distribution in a square duct. The experimental technique consists of measuring the Doppler shift of laser radiation scattered by particles moving with the fluid. From this frequency shift, the fluid velocity is inferred. Measurements in the entrance region and fully developed flow region of a square duct indicate that the velocity profile development takes place in a somewhat longer section of the duct than had been predicted. Measurements of the fully developed flow indicate that the optical technique used is capable of measuring velocity within an accuracy of at least 0.1 percent.

AB  - The influence of Coriolis force on heat transfer in a rotating transitional boundary layer has been experimentally investigated. The experiments have been conducted for local Gortler numbers up to 150. Heat transfer measurements have been performed for a flat plate with nearly uniform heat flux applied to the surface, where the temperature was measured by the thermochromic liquid crystal method. The results indicate that heat transfer is enhanced when Coriolis force acts towards the wall, i.e., on the pressure surface. The velocity measurements under equivalent conditions show that Coriolis instability induces counter-rotating longitudinal vortices which augment the lateral transport of the fluid on the pressure surface. On the other hand, the heat transfer on the suction surface remains at the same level as compared to the case without system rotation. As a consequence, the heat transfer coefficient on the pressure surface is 1.8 times higher than that measured on the suction surface when averaged over the measured surface.

AB  - The Hesperian-Amazonian age volcanic shield, Alba Patera, has associated with it some of the largest volcanic flows on Mars. An early (Hesperian) flood-lava phase was followed by the extrusion of high-volume sheet and tube-fed lavas, many of which emerged from fissures on the flanks of a rising dome. Subsequently a plethora of sheet and tube-fed lavas were erupted from linear vents located either at or within 200 km of the present summit. These built complex flow fields which were erupted at rates several orders of magnitude greater than the maximum Hawaiian rates. Later (Amazonian) volcanism at Alba saw extrusions of long, narrow flows from two complex summit calde- ras whose formation is inferred to have been a direct result of magma supply to the volcano's flanks. The outflow of thermal energy related to emplacement of some single flows (6 x 10 ~ ergs) was substantially greater than the Earth's annual heat loss through volcanism and implies that patera building must have been a significant source of geologi- cally rapid heat loss from Mars during the early stages of volcanic centralization on the planet.

AB  - 'Transforming Cities with Transit' explores the complex process of transit and land-use integration in rapidly growing cities in developing countries. As one of the most promising strategies for advancing environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, and socially inclusive development in fast-growing cities, transit and land-use integration is increasingly being embraced by policy-makers at all levels of government. This book focuses on identifying barriers to and opportunities for effective coordination of transport infrastructure and urban development. Global best-case practices of transit-oriented metropolises that have direct relevance to cities in developing countries are first introduced. Key institutional, regulatory, and financial constraints that hamper integration and opportunities to utilize transit to guide sustainable urban development are examined in selected cities in developing countries. For this, the book analyzes their Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems and their impact on land development. The book formulates recommendations and implementation strategies to overcome barriers and take advantage of opportunities. It asserts that unprecedented opportunities have and will continue to arise for the successful integration of transit and land development in much of the developing world. Many cities in developing countries currently exhibit the pre-requisites - e.g., rapid growth, rising real incomes, and increased motorization and congestion levels - for BRT and railway investments to trigger meaningful land-use changes in economically and financially viable ways. Recommendations for creating more sustainable cities of the future range from macro-level strategies that influence land development and governance at the metropolitan scale to micro-level initiatives, like Transit Oriented Development (TOD), that can radically transform development patterns at the neighborhood level. The book will be of interest to a wide and diverse audience, including mayors, council members and other national and local policy makers, urban and transportation planners, transit-agency officials, and developers and staff of development financial institutions and others involved with TOD projects in rapidly growing and motorizing cities of the developing world.

AB  - Split-flow thin (SPLITT) fractionation devices have been widely used to separate macromolecules, colloids, cells and particles. Recently, the quadrupole magnetic flow sorter (QMS) has been reported in the literature as another family of SPLITT fractionation device. However, the separation performance observed in the experimental measurements is generally found to deviate from the ideal behaviour. Possible causes such as hydrodynamic lift force, high particle concentration and imperfect geometries have been extensively examined. However, the effects of flow development regions and fringing magnetic force field at the separation channel inlet and outlet, which are ignored by the theory, have not been investigated. The error introduced by ignoring these effects need to be rigorously studied so that the theory can be used to optimise operation flow rates with confidence. Indeed, we find in this paper that these ignored effects are responsible to the discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. A new theory has been proposed for optimisation of device operation. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Limited support is found for usually applied models for the turbulence frequency production and wall damping effects. In contrast to that it is shown that turbulence frequency production mechanisms and wall damping effects may be explained very well on the basis of a frequency scaling that characterizes mean ﬂow changes. The inﬂuence of compressibility is found to be relevant.

AB  - The micro-pillar wall-shear stress sensor MPS3 has been used to measure the dynamic wall-shear stress in turbulent pipe flow. The sensor device consists of a flexible micro-pillar which extends from the wall into the viscous sublayer. The pillar-tip deflection caused by the exerting fluid forces serves as a measure for the local wall-shear stress. The pillar is statically calibrated in linear shear flow. A second-order estimate of the pillar dynamic response based on experimentally determined sensor characteristics shows the potential of the present sensor configuration to also measure the dynamic wall-shear stress. The quality of the micro-pillar shear stress sensor MPS3 to correctly determine the skin friction will be shown by measuring the wall friction in a well-defined fully developed turbulent pipe flow at Reynolds numbers Reb based on the bulk velocity Ub and the pipe diameter D in the range of Reb = 10, 000 s(-) 20, 000. The results demonstrate a convincing agreement of the mean and dynamic wall-shear stress obtained with the MPS3 sensor technique with analytical, experimental, and numerical results from the literature. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Fully developed turbulent single-phase DNS results obtained previously (Trofimova et al., 2009) with the same stabilized FEM code, were used as the initial flow field, and a level-set distance field was introduced to resolve and track the gas bubbles. Surface tension and gravity forces were used in the simulation to physically represent the behavior of a bubbly two-phase air/water flow. The DDNS results were averaged to obtain the mean liquid and gas velocity distributions, the local gas volume fractions, and the local turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate of the liquid phase. The liquid phase parameters were compared with the corresponding single-phase turbulent channel flow to appraise the bubbles’ influence on the liquid’s turbulence field and to quantify the importance of bubble-induced turbulence.

A new immersed boundary method (IBM) is used for a geometry\nconsisting of a square body in a flow. The method is applied to flow\ncases with and without heat transfer. The obstacle simulated in the\ndomain is implemented by local forcing of the flow with a procedure\nthat adjusts locally the shear stress at the position of the object\nin conjunction with a non-penetration condition on the body walls.\nThis approach has already been successfully applied by Breugem and\nBoersma (Phys.

However, the proposed method can not\nbe simply extended to immersed boundaries not aligned with the grid.

AB  - Direct numerical simulations have been conducted with many cluster models of beads and connecting springs in a turbulent channel flow in order to investigate how the low-speed streaks and the small-scale flow related to the streaks are affected by the cluster models. The cluster model represents highly entangled polymers observed in the quiescent and flowing aqueous solution. The cluster models were introduced in the buffer region to simulate the experiments of Tiederman et al. (Tiederman, W.G., Luchik, T.S., Bogard, D.G., 1985. Wall-layer structure and drag reduction. J. Fluid Mech. 156, 419-437) in which the polymer solution was injected from a slot in the channel wall. An experiment has been carried out for visual observation of highly entangled polymers in a turbulent channel flow of the same Reynolds number in order to determine a parameter of the cluster model. The computational results show that the minor streaks and the small-scale eruptive flows associated with the streamwise vortices are attenuated selectively by the cluster models. The length scale and time scale of these structures are comparable to those of the cluster model. On the other hand, the dynamics of large-scale streaks are found to be basically unchanged. These results are consistent with the measurement of a suppression of low threshold Reynolds-stress producing motion by Harder and Tiederman (Harder, K.J., Tiederman, W.G., 1991.

AB  - The sensitivity of orifice plate flow meters to the quality of the approaching flow continues to be a cause for concern in flow metering. The distortions caused by pipe fittings such as valves, bends, compressors and other devices located upstream of the orifice plate can lead to non-standard velocity profiles and give errors in measurement. The design of orifice plate meters that are independent of the initial flow conditions of the upstream is a major goal in flow metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal.The effect of a fractal flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions was obtained in experimental work and also using simulations. The measurement of mass flow rate under different conditions and different Reynolds numbers was used to establish a change in discharge coefficient relative to a standard one. The experimental results using the fractal flow conditioner show that the combination of an orifice plate and a fractal flow conditioner is broadly insensitive to upstream disturbances.The simulation results also show that the device can be used as a part of a flow metering package that will considerably reduce installation lengths. Previous work with orifice plates has shown that a combination of flow conditioner and orifice plate was promising. The results of using a combination of the fractal flow conditioner and orifice plate for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show that this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the Standards. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The mean-flow structure of supersonic, turbulent, adiabatic-wall flow in a square duct is investigated experi- mentally over a development length of 50 duct widths for a uniform flow, Mach 3.9 condition at the duct inlet. The results show that a secondary flow cell structure develops that is similar to that for the incompressible case. This secondary flow distorts the primary flow, whose behavior also is influenced by shear-layer interaction ef- fects as the wall boundary layers merge. Axial mean-velocity profiles plotted in terms of van Driest-scaled varia- bles show that a well-defined log-law region exists in the near-wall layer. This region exists in the presence of a secondary flow that continuously modifies spanwise wall shear stress behavior along the length of the duct.

AB  - In spite of strenuous efforts over the last half century, the engineering prediction of flow and sediment transport over bedforms, in general, and dunes, in particular, still presents a major obstacle in the solution of sedimentation problems in alluvial channels. Fig. 1 illustrates the presence of dunes in the field ~the Rhine River in The Netherlands!. The basic problem of sediment transport can be stated in a deceptively simple manner: given sediment and fluid characteristics, channel geometry, and discharge, what is the expected flow depth and the amount of sediment that will be transported? Even for the simplest case of a well-sorted sediment in a straight prismatic channel with rigid banks, a general answer to these two questions ~to be referred to hereafter as the basic questions! can only be given with an uncomfortably high degree of uncertainty, and much of the difficulty can be traced to the development of bed forms. The traditional approach to dealing with the effect of dunes is described in the standard monographs on sediment transport. The earlier review by Engelund and Fredsoe ~1982! provides a convenient point of reference. From an engineering point of view, the approach described in a series of papers by van Rijn ~1984a,b,c! has been influential. Has our understanding or predictive ability improved to any significant extent since the appearance of these reviews/papers? Advances in measurement and simulation technologies as well as progress in the understanding of related phenomena such as turbulent wall-bounded flows have stimulated recent research that may contribute to a more adequate response to the basic questions. Moreover, the topic has attracted the attention not only of researchers in hydraulics but also of earth scientists ~e.g., Allen 1984!, with potentially useful results and contributions being published in disparate journals and monographs not necessarily familiar to the sedimentation engineering community. An ASCE Task Committee has therefore been formed with the aim of examining, and where possible, synthesizing, state-of-the-art knowledge concerning flow and sediment transport over dunes, emphasizing the progress ~if any! over the past 20 years. To organize the discussion, the various aspects of the problem may be broadly divided into two categories, namely, ~1! equilibrium, and ~2! transient or developmental. The former involves ‘‘fully-developed’’ dunes that have evolved from an approximately steady uniform flow; whereas, the latter includes questions dealing with instabilities and transitions when bed-form characteristics are still changing with time. The description and analysis of equilibrium aspects may be more tractable in that only a final, potentially unique state, more or less easily accessible to experimental observation, is of interest. Transient problems, being concerned with a continuum of states, would seem to pose greater difficulties, theoretical as well as experimental and, not surprisingly, are likely associated with the largest errors in predictions. Because the real-world problem of dunes in natural streams may involve such a multitude of factors, including temporally and spatially varying flow as well as dune and channel geometry and sediment heterogeneity, laboratory and theoretical/numerical studies have almost invariably chosen to investigate simplified cases in the hopes of elucidating essential mechanisms. Such an approach would also seem wise for a review: is there consensus on what would be the essence of the problem, stripped of all ‘‘higher-order’’ effects? Would it be dunes in a straight laboratory channel formed from uniformly sized sediment under a steady discharge? If so, what can be said definitively about even this simplest case? Ultimately, any theoretical model must be evaluated on its efficacy in explaining and/or predicting real-world ‘‘messy’’ phenomena and on its agreement with measurements from field studies, such that the limitations of simplifications must be kept keenly in mind.

AB  - Although the hydraulic jump has been investigated experimentally for nearly two centuries, little information is known of the air-water flow properties in the shear region. New experiments were performed in a horizontal channel with partially-developed inflow conditions. Distributions of air concentration, mean air-water velocity and bubble frequency were recorded and presented herein. The results indicate an advective diffusion of air in the shear layer. The velocity profiles have a similar shape as wall jet flows but different quantitative parameters must be introduced. The relationship between air content and bubble frequency has a parabolic shape which is not yet understood but was observed previously in open channel flows. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The influence of the exit boundary conditions on the vanishing first derivative of the velocity components and constant pressure on the large eddy simulation of the fully developed turbulent channel flow has been investigated for equidistant and stretched grids at the channel exit. Results show that the chosen exit boundary conditions introduce some small disturbances that are mostly damped by the grid stretching. The difference of rms values between the fully developed turbulent channel flow with periodicity conditions and the fully developed channel flow using inlet and the exit boundary conditions is less than 10% for the equidistant grids and less than 5% for the stretched grids. The chosen boundary conditions are of interest because they may be used in complex problems with back flow at the exit. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The flow over a trailing edge is computed using two dif- ferent techniques to reduce the computational costs of LES. A hybrid method designed to split the contributions of the averaged and fluctuating velocity fields is used in order to re- lax the near-wallmesh requirements. A syntheticmethod for turbulence generation is used at the inlet in order to avoid a costly precursor simulation. The methodology has been first tested on channel flows at high Reynolds numbers on coarse meshes. The results at different Reynolds numbers up to Reτ are presented. They agree well with DNS data avail- able in terms of mean velocities and stresses. The results for the trailing-edge flow are compared with the full LES with inlet boundary conditions from a precursor boundary layer simulation. Two cases are presented, one with a precursor simulation and one with the synthetic eddy method. The predictions of mean velocities and turbulent content agree well with the reference LES simulation.

AB  - In investigations of laminar or turbulent flows, wall shear is often important. Nevertheless, conventional particle image velocimetry (PIV) is difficult in near-wall regions. A near-wall measurement technique, named interfacial PIV (IPIV) [Nguyen, C., Nguyen, T., Wells, J., Nakayama, A., 2008. Proposals for PIV of near-wall flow over curved boundaries. In: Proceedings of 14th International Symposium on Applications of Laser Technique to Fluid Mechanics], handles curved boundaries by means of conformal transformation, directly measures the wall gradient, and yields the near-wall tangential velocity profile at one-pixel resolution. In this paper, we show the feasibility of extending IPIV to measure wall gradients by stereo reconstruction. First, we perform a test on synthetic images generated from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) snapshot of turbulent flow over sinusoidal bed. Comparative assessment of wall gradients derived by IPIV, stereo-IPIV and particle image distortion (PID) [Huang, H.T., Fiedler, H.E., Wang, J.J., 1993. Limitation and improvement of PIV. Experiments in Fluids 15(4), 263-273] is evaluated with DNS data. Also, the sensitivity of IPIV and stereo-IPIV results to the uncertainty of identified wall position is examined. As a practical application of IPIV and stereo-IPIV to experimental images, results from turbulent open channel flow over a backward-facing step are discussed in detail. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The flow field due to an impinging jet at a moderately high Reynolds number, emanating from a rectangular slot nozzle has been computed using a large eddy simulation (LES) technique. A dynamic subgrid-scale stress model has been used for the small scales of turbulence. Quite a few successful applications of the dynamic subgrid-scale stress model use planar averaging to avoid ill conditioning of the model coefficient. However, a novel localization procedure has been attempted herein to find out the spatially varying model coefficient of the flow. The flow field is characterized by entrainment at the boundaries. Periodic boundary conditions could not be used on all the boundaries. The results reveal the nuances of the vortical structures that are characteristics of jet flows. The stress budget also captures a locally negative turbulence production rate. The calibration of the model has been made through prediction of the normalized axial velocity profile and heat transfer on the impingement plate. The computed results compare favorably with the experimental observations, especially in the stagnation zone. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a Large-Eddy simulation of a vortex cell with circular shaped. The results show that the flow field can be sub divided into four important zones, the shear layer above the cavity, the stagnation zone, the vortex core in the cavity and the boundary layer along the wall of the cavity. It is shown that the vortex core consits of solid body rotation without much turbulence activity. The vortex is mainly driven by high energy packets that are driven into the cavity from the stagnation point region and by entrainment of fluid from the cavity into the shear layer. The physics in the boundary layer along the cavitys wall seems to be far from that of a canonical boundary layer which might be a crucial point for modelling this flow

AB  - A direct numerical simulation is performed for turbulent heat transfer in a concentric annulus at Re D h =8900 and Pr =0.71 for two radius ratios ( R 1 / R 2 =0.1 and 0.5) and wall heat flux ratio q * =1.0. Main emphasis is placed on the transverse curvature effect on near-wall turbulent thermal structures. Near-wall turbulent thermal structures close to the inner and outer walls are scrutinized by computing the lower-order statistics. The fluctuating temperature variance and turbulent heat flux budgets are illustrated to confirm the results of the lower-order statistics. Probability density functions of the splat/anti-splat process are investigated to analyze the transverse curvature effect on the strong relationship between sweep and splat events. The present numerical results show that the turbulent thermal structures near the outer wall are more activated than those near the inner wall, which may be attributed to the different vortex regeneration processes between the inner and outer walls.

AB  - We have studied the dynamics of non-colloidal short fiber suspensions in bounded shear flow using the Stokesian dynamics simulation. Such particles make up the microstructure of many suspensions for which the macroscopic dynamics are not well understood. The effect of wall on the fiber dynamics is the main focus of this work. For a single fiber undergoing simple shear flow between plane parallel walls the period of rotation was compared with the Jeffrey's orbit. A fiber placed close to the wall shows significant deviation from Jeffrey's orbit. The fiber moving near a solid wall in bounded shear flow follows a pole-vaulting motion, and its centroid location from the wall is also periodic. Simulations were also carried out to study the effect of fiber-fiber interactions on the viscosity of concentrated suspensions. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.

AB  - : The modeling of unsteady wall shear stress plays a crucial role in the analysis of fast transients in pressurized pipe systems, since it allows to evaluate transient energy dissipation properly. The main aim of this paper is to give a contribution to the understanding of transient pressurized flow dynamics in turbulent regime by measuring not only pressure but also the instantaneous axial velocity profile at two sections of the laboratory pipe. Specifically, by means of ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry—a completely nonintrusive technique— instantaneous velocity gradients at pipe wall are measured allowing to evaluate the time history of the actual wall shear stress by coupling velocity measurements to a two-zone stress model. As a result, the behavior of accelerating and decelerating flows with respect to the corresponding steady ones, i.e., with the same value of the discharge, is pointed out. Due to the characteristics of the laboratory pipe—a 352-m long high density polyethylene pipe—transients phenomena are investigated both at short and long time scales.

We present both the general and simplified transport equations for the resolved turbulent stresses, which are essential for understanding the unique pattern of turbulent kinetic energy production in a rotating system. Numerical simulations are performed using primarily two dynamic subgrid-scale stress models and one dynamic subgrid-scale heat flux model; namely, the conventional dynamic model (DM) and a novel dynamic nonlinear model (DNM) for closure of the filtered momentum equation, and an advanced dynamic full linear tensor thermal diffusivity model (DFLTDM) for closure of the filtered thermal energy equation.

A detailed comparative study has been conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the DM and DNM in terms of their prediction of characteristic features of the velocity and temperature fields and their capability of reflecting both forward and backward scatter of kinetic energy between the filtered and subgrid scales. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) flows are investigated theoretically and numerically in this paper and results are presented for the flow field in model electrostatic precipitators (EPs). The resulting flow fields are shown in various representations and explained qualitatively. Numerical calculations with different flow models (non-turbulent and RANS) were conducted to investigate the influence of the flow model on the resulting secondary flows. Furthermore, a perturbation analysis is presented, leading to a simple differential equation of the Helmholtz type. This allows a more detailed view of the important mechanisms forming the secondary flows as well as being able to obtain a very fast estimation of the resulting flow field. The calculations reveal a strong influence of a vortex formation at the beginning of the precipitation zone on the whole flow field. Furthermore, a strong effect of the boundary conditions of the electric field and the operating parameters is shown.

As such, they operate with a conception of information that brackets its meaning, while allowing "information as meaning" to remain as an unspoken background that seeps into its discourse. An analysis of information science and economics will show that "information" is defined as nonsemantic discrete bits flowing across space and then directed and stored. This substantiates information as the object of control.

The results show that rapid changes in the film flow parameters occur within the first 50 tube diameters or so from the inlet.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to validate an in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver, called les3d-mp, developed for high-resolution numerical simulations of boundary layer combustion. les3d-mp is a low Mach number, Navier-Stokes flow solver and is based on: a second-order fractional-step implicit scheme for time integration; a second-order finite difference scheme for spatial discretization; a classical staggered computational grid framework; a direct matrix inversion solver for the pressure equation; a standard rectangular Cartesian mesh capability; and a parallel computing implementation based on Message Passing Interface (MPI). les3d-mp provides a choice between a number of modeling options for the treatment of turbulence, including direct numerical simulation (DNS), large eddy simulation (LES) and Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS); the present study corresponds to weak-to-moderate turbulence levels and adopts a DNS approach. Combustion is treated using a classical “equilibrium”, infinitely fast-chemistry combustion model with mixture fraction and total enthalpy as principal variables; thermodynamic properties are evaluated using CHEMKIN databases. Thermal radiation transport is currently neglected. The present study considers a simple non-premixed wall flame configuration in which the fuel corresponds to pyrolysis products supplied by a thermally-degrading flat sample of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and the oxidizer corresponds to a cross-flow of ambient air with controlled mean velocity and turbulence properties. This configuration was previously studied experimentally at the University of California at Berkeley; the air cross-flow features moderate turbulence levels, i.e. a free stream velocity of 2 m/s and turbulence intensities between 5 and 15%. The numerical simulations use an advanced inflow forcing technique to simulate the air cross-flow as well as experimental data to prescribe the fuel mass flux at the wall; the wall surface temperatures are currently prescribed using a simplified description. Comparisons between numerical results and experimental data are made in terms of flame structure and flame length. Current work is aimed at removing the simplifications adopted in the description of the wall surface temperatures and at evaluating the accuracy of the numerical predictions for the wall (convective) heat flux.

AB  - In this paper the results of flow control experiments utilizing single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators to control flow separation and unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder in cross-flow are reported. This work is motivated by the need to reduce landing gear noise for commercial transport aircraft via an effective streamlining created by the actuators. The experiments are performed at ReD = 33,000. Using either steady or unsteady actuation, Karman shedding is totally eliminated, turbulence levels in the wake decrease significantly and near-field sound pressure levels are reduced by 13.3 dB. Unsteady actuation at an excitation frequency of StD = 1 is found to be most effective. The unsteady actuation also has the advantage that total suppression of shedding is achieved for a duty cycle of only 25.

AB  - New results of experimental investigation accounted for the parametric effects of the bubble size and the two-phase flow rates on the wall shear stress are reported. The mean and the time-varying fluctuation properties of the wall shear stress are measured based on a flush-mounted hot film sensor for air-water bubbly flow in a vertical channel. The unique feature of this study is that the experiments were carried out under various fixed gas and liquid fluxes, with only the bubble size being changed at the flow entrance. This has been made by using a special bubble generator to decouple the bubble size effect from the inlet condition. The test conditions cover both the wall and core peaking void distributions of bubbly two-phase flow. It is found that the wall shear stress is strongly influenced by the internal and wall proximity structure of the flow, while both the liquid phase velocity and the wall concentrated bubbles are the dominant parameters on both the magnitude and the fluctuation intensity of the wall shear stress in the regime of bubbly flow. The present data are extensively compared with some other data sources and with the models used in predicting the wall shear stress. Due to no obvious existing wall shear stress data and models were accounted for the change in bubble size systematically, the present data thus may serve as a relatively complete comparative basis for the development of theoretical models.

AB  - SummaryThe accumulation and survival of microorganisms attached to a solid surface, is dependent on the physical characteristics of the system in which they exist, including fluid flow, mass transfer and to a lesser extent heat transfer. The conditions relating to the flow of water across a surface, particularly the velocity of flow and its distribution, have a profound effect on the colonisation of the surface by the microorganisms and the subsequent availability of nutrients. Furthermore the flow of water imposes a drag force on the biofilm with the distinct possibility that at least, some biofilm removal will occur. Mass transfer involves the movement of the microorganisms and nutrient to sustain the biofilm. It depends on the fluid flow conditions and the concentration difference between the bulk water and the biofilm. Since microbial deposits are sensitive to the prevailing temperature, heat transfer to or from a biofilm may influence sustainability.

AB  - Large-Eddy simulation (LES) is performed to study pulsatile blood flow through a 3D model of arterial stenosis. The model is chosen as a simple channel with a biological type stenosis formed on the top wall. A sinusoidal non-additive type pulsation is assumed at the inlet of the model to generate time dependent oscillating flow in the channel and the Reynolds number of 1200, based on the channel height and the bulk velocity, is chosen in the simulations. We investigate in detail the transition-to-turbulent phenomena of the non-additive pulsatile blood flow downstream of the stenosis. Results show that the high level of flow recirculation associated with complex patterns of transient blood flow have a significant contribution to the generation of the turbulent fluctuations found in the post-stenosis region. The importance of using LES in modelling pulsatile blood flow is also assessed in the paper through the prediction of its sub-grid scale contributions. In addition, some important results of the flow physics are achieved from the simulations, these are presented in the paper in terms of blood flow velocity, pressure distribution, vortices, shear stress, turbulent fluctuations and energy spectra, along with their importance to the relevant medical pathophysiology. © 2008 IPEM.

AB  - Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of open-channel flow in the presence of an air-water interface was performed to examine the effects of interface deformation on the turbulence structures. In the water-driven turbulence, flows characterized by either of two Froude numbers (Fr=0.2 and 0.8) were examined and compared. A coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method was employed to track the interface. The air that contacted the water was entrained into the turbulent flow. At high Fr, all turbulent normal stresses on the air side of the interface were high near the sidewall. Moreover, all terms of the Reynolds shear stress were intensified at the mixed-boundary corner on the air side of the interface. Two-point correlations between the streamwise vortex and the velocity fluctuations provided structural information about the near-wall streaky structures and the inner secondary flows in the cross-stream plane. Linear stochastic estimates of the conditionally averaged flow field showed that the inner secondary flow consisted of not only in-plane velocity components but also streamwise velocity components.

AB  - Shear velocity u(*) is a well-known fundamental velocity scale of the wall turbulence, widely used for scaling various flow quantities such as mean velocity and turbulent intensities. The definition of shear velocity is closely related to the universal Logarithmic law of the wall, which was originally derived for constant shear stress boundary layers. Because the shear stress is constant, the momentum flux rho u(*)(2) is equal to the wall shear stress, so u(*) is often understood as some kind of synonym for the wall shear stress. The universal Log-law is also used for the flows with linear shear stress such as pipe flows and uniform open channel flows. In such flows the turbulent momentum flux delivered to the roughness differs from the wall shear stress, but the difference is negligible for the rough walls where boundary layer thickness (flow depth in case of uniform open channel flow), is much larger than roughness height. In rough wall flows where the flow depth and the roughness height are of the similar order, the difference between the turbulent momentum flux representative of the free outer flow and the wall shear stress may become significant. For such flows it is important to distinguish between the wall shear stress and the shear stress used for evaluation of the shear velocity. This paper highlights the problems associated with the definition of the shear velocity in shallow open channel flows and its use for evaluation of the bed shear stress. The influence of the definition of u(*) on the data analysis is illustrated using experimental results.

AB  - In this paper, a new dynamic global-coefficient nonlinear subgrid scale (SGS) model is proposed for large eddy simulation (LES) of rotating turbulent channel flow. The basic model is a nonlinear model with a tensorial polynomial relation between the SGS stress and the resolved strain rate tensor. A new dynamic procedure is proposed to determine the model coefficients of the nonlinear model. The new dynamic method is derived from the globally averaged transport equation of the Reynolds shear stress, on which the rotation has strong and direct effects. The new dynamic nonlinear SGS model is examined in rotating turbulent channel at Re = u(m)h/nu = 7000, Ro = 2 Omega h/u(m) = 0.3 and 0.6, where Reynolds number Re and Rotation number Ro are defined by bulk mean velocity u(m), half channel width h, kinematic viscosity nu and angular velocity of spanwise rotation Omega. The statistical results obtained from the new model agree well with those from direct numerical simulation (DNS). The new model also successfully predicts the major structures in rotating turbulent channel flow, such as Taylor-Gortler vortices and streaks.

These include mean velocity, turbulence stresses, velocity skewncss and flatness factors, space-time correlations and spectra, all the terms in the Reynolds-stress balance equations, and contour and vector plots of instantaneous velocity fields. The effects of ci~rvature on this flow were determined by co~nparing the concave and convex sides of the channel. The observed effects are corisistent with experiments! observations for mild curvature. The nlost significant d:.- ience in the tnrbulence statistics between the concave and convex sides was ill the Reynolds shear stress. This was acco~npanied by significant differences in the terms of the Reynolds shear stress balance equations. In addition, it was found that stationary Taylor-Giirtler vortices were present and that they had a significant effect on the flow by contributing to the meau Rcyuolds shear stress, and by affecting the anderlying turbulence. Turbule~lce statistics were found to be in qualitative agreement with the large-eddy simulation of a plane channel performed by hhin & Kim (J. Fluid Mech. 118, 341, 1982). Near the walls, the flow consists of alternating high and low speed streaks, with mean spanwise spacing of 100 wall units. It was also found, however, t;iat near the wall, the velocity fluctuations normal to the wall are dominated by small, intense rcgions that are not significa~ltly elongated in the stream\vise direc- tion. Streamwise vortices wcre observed near the walls and were found to occur most often as a single vortex, rather than in vortex pairs.

AB  - The distribution of nonstenosing, asymptomatic intimal plaques in 12 adult human carotid bifurcations obtained at autopsy was compared with the distribution of flow streamline patterns, flow velocity profiles, and shear stresses in corresponding scale models. The postmortem specimens were fixed while distended to restore normal in vivo length, diameter, and configuration. Angiograms were used to measure branch angles and diameters, and transverse histological sections were studied at five standard sampling levels. Intimal thickness was determined at 15 degrees intervals around the circumference of the vessel sections from contour tracings of images projected onto a digitizing plate. In the models, laser-Doppler anemometry was used to determine flow velocity profiles and shear stresses at levels corresponding to the standard specimen sampling sites under conditions of steady flow at Reynolds numbers of 400, 800, and 1200, and flow patterns were visualized by hydrogen bubble and dye-washout techniques. Intimal thickening was greatest and consistently eccentric in the carotid sinus. With the center of the flow divider as the 0 degree index point, mid-sinus sections showed minimum intimal thickness (0.05 +/- 0.02 mm) within 15 degrees of the index point, while maximum thickness (0.9 +/- 0.1 mm) occurred at 161 +/- 16 degrees, i.e., on the outer wall opposite the flow divider. Where the intima was thinnest, along the inner wall, flow streamlines in the model remain axially aligned and unidirectional, with velocity maxima shifted toward the flow divider apex. Wall shear stress along the inner wall ranged from 31 to 600 dynes/cm2 depending on the Reynolds number. Where the intima was thickest, along the outer wall opposite the flow divider apex, the pattern of flow was complex and included a region of separation and reversal of axial flow as well as the development of counter-rotating helical trajectories. Wall shear stress along the outer wall ranged from 0 to -6 dynes/cm2. Intimal thickening at the common carotid and distal internal carotid levels of section was minimal and was distributed uniformly about the circumference. We conclude that in the human carotid bifurcation, regions of moderate to high shear stress, where flow remains unidirectional and axially aligned, are relatively spared of intimal thickening. Intimal thickening and atherosclerosis develop largely in regions of relatively low wall shear stress, flow separation, and departure from axially aligned, unidirectional flow. Similar quantitative evaluations of other atherosclerosis-prone locations and corresponding flow profile studies in geometrically accurate models may reveal which of these hemodynamic conditions are most consistently associated with the development of intimal disease.

AB  - ABSTRACT We report large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent channel flow. This LES neither resolves nor partially resolves the near-wall region. Instead, we develop a special near-wall subgrid-scale (SGS) model based on wall-parallel filtering and wall-normal averaging of the streamwise momentum equation, with an assumption of local inner scaling used to reduce the unsteady term. This gives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the wall shear stress at every wall location that is coupled with the LES. An extended form of the stretched-vortex SGS model, which incorporates the production of near-wall Reynolds shear stress due to the winding of streamwise momentum by near-wall attached SGS vortices, then provides a log relation for the streamwise velocity at the top boundary of the near-wall averaged domain. This allows calculation of an instantaneous slip velocity that is then used as a ‘virtual-wall’ boundary condition for the LES. A Kármán-like constant is calculated dynamically as part of the LES. With this closure we perform LES of turbulent channel flow for Reynolds numbers Reτ based on the friction velocity uτ and the channel half-width δ in the range 2 × 103 to 2 × 107. Results, including SGS-extended longitudinal spectra, compare favourably with the direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of Hoyas & Jiménez (2006) at Reτ = 2003 and maintain an O(1) grid dependence on Reτ.

The flow velocities were measured experimentally with P-EMS velocimeter. The results of the experimental data and the numerical simulation showed that the flow pattern in a channel bend is influenced widely by the secondary flow and centrifugal force. The comparison between the experimental data and the numerical model showed that SSIIM-1.1 is capable to simulate accurately the flow pattern in a 90??bend.

AB  - The aorta, with complex geometry is one of the most vulnerable arteries for creation and development of cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis. Because of the association of disease with region of altered fluid mechanics, the role of blood flow in the localization of atherosclerosis has been extensively studied recently. The diameter of aorta, its branches, and the geometry of branches are parameters which affect the blood flow significantly. However, much less attention has been focused on the effect of these parameters and their association with diseased regions. In the present study, three different geometries of human aorta with three branches are constructed and blood flow inside the arteries is simulated. Flow across longitudinal cross-sections of all three geometries is analyzed. The disturbed velocity profiles are observed near branchiocephalic, left common artery and left subclavian artery. On the other hand, the wall shear stress profiles at the roots of branches show significant differences with geometry variation of aorta and branches. The blood flow is considered as homogeneous, incompressible, and Newtonian fluid flow.

At low and high frequencies the response to the turbulent wall shear stress is in accordance with the existing relations between the amplitudes of the wall shear stress and the mass transfer rates obtained for harmonic perturbations. At intermediate frequencies the turbulent wall shear stress fluctuations produce a larger damping in comparison with the harmonic perturbations. The phase angle of the response of mass transfer rates with respect to the wall shear stress shows important deviations in comparison with the phase angle obtained with harmonic perturbations, specially at high frequencies. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Swirl flow has applications in many of the engineering equipments. Good amount of calculations exist which have been developed for design of propellers. However, swirler design for combustion applications is different from that for propeller applications. In the former swirl flow is generated by the application of tangential component to the axial flow whereas in the latter swirl is generated by the rotating propellers. Therefore it comes under the category of rotating flows. Quite a few studies have been carried out on vane generated swirl flows over the past four decades. Majority of the studies were based on experiments. Over the last one decade, attention has been focused on the numerical predictions. Due to the advent of fast digital computers, nowadays the CFD studies are becoming the part of the design methodologies. This study mainly focuses attention on arriving at best vane angle from aerodynamic aspects for the combustion applications. As there are large number of flow and geometric parameters involved arriving at the best design by experimental methods is rather difficult compared to CFD analyses. The important geometric parameters are vane angle, vane numbers and hub to tip ratio. The flow parameter involves the selection of appropriate turbulence model for the prediction. The uniqueness of this study is in arriving at the best vane angle using appropriate turbulence models for both weak and strong swirl. To this end experimental and numerical studies have been carried out. It is found that no single turbulence model is able to handle both weak and strong swirl. From this study it is concluded that for weak swirl standard k - ?? model is sufficient whereas for strong swirl one has to resort to Reynolds stress model. The characteristics of swirl flow are evaluated by means of size of the recirculation zone, mass trapped in the recirculation zone and also the pressure drop. Over the range of vane angle investigated the best vane angle is found to be 45??. ?? 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - We extend fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to systems that undergo translation or laminar flow in a sample cell. We include theoretical and experimental results; we consider uniform and nonuniform velocity profiles. Concentration correlation analysis extracts mi- croscopic rate parameters from measurements of the spontaneous concentration fluctuations, which occur even at equilibrium. Fluorescence is one of the most sensitive means of moni- toring these fluctuations. Analysis of flowing or translating systems (1) offers a method of measuring number concentrations of selected species, for example, of aggregates or polymers, (2) provides a nonperturbing velocity probe, (3) sometimes allows one to circumvent photolytic degradation, (4) has proved extremely helpful in testing and aligning apparatus for fluores- cence correlation measurements and in verifying theoretical analyses, and (5) may be required for interpretation of results obtained on systems in motion, even though that motion is un- desired or initially unsuspected. We include both theoretical and experimental results for combined Poiseuille flow and diffusion in the geometry which is of most practical interest. Theoretical expressions for the much simpler cases of nondiffusive Poiseuille flow as well as uniform flow or translation with or without diffusion constitute limiting cases which are displayed explicitly.

AB  - Transonic turbulent boundary-layer flow over a circular-arc bump has been computed by high-resolution large-eddy simulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The inflow turbulence was prescribed using a new technique, in which known dynamical features of the inner and outer part of the boundary-layer were exploited to produce a standard turbulent boundary-layer within a short distance of the inflow. This method was separately tested for a flat plate turbulent boundary-layer, for which results compared well with direct numerical simulation databases. Simulation of the bump flow was carried out using high-order methods, with the dynamic Smagorinsky model used for sub-grid terms in the momentum and energy equations. Simulations were carried out at a Reynolds number of 233,000 based on bump length and free-stream properties upstream of the bump. At a back pressure equal to 0.65 times the stagnation pressure, a normal shock was formed near the bump trailing-edge and a peak mean Mach number of 1.16 was observed. Turbulence fluctuations decayed in the favourable pressure gradient region of the flow, before being amplified due to the shock interaction and boundary-layer separation. The effect of Reynolds number on turbulence intensity upstream of the shock is discussed in connection with a laminarisation parameter. With reference to turbulence modelling, anisotropy levels are not unreasonably high in the shock interaction region and shock unsteadiness was not found to be an issue. Of more relevance to the perceived poor performance of models for this type of flow may be the extremely rapid rise and decay of turbulence levels in the separated shear layer immediately under the shock-wave. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - In this paper we consider a direct numerical simulation of transition from laminar to turbulent flow excited by wall disturbances in a cylindrical pipe. The wall disturbances are imposed by means of flowing and suction through the pipe wall. Two cases are considered: periodic suction/blowing (PSB) and random suction/flowing (RSB). The former case can be interpreted as a pipe flow in combination with a periodic roughness element of a fixed size and the latter as a pipe with randomly distributed wall roughness elements. For the PSB case the critical amplitude of the blowing/suction velocity that causes transition is obtained. The dependence of this critical amplitudes on the Reynolds number is considered. In addition the dependence of the transition time of the suction/blowing amplitudes and the Reynolds number is investigated. This latter parameter is also considered for the RSB case.

AB  - The flow development in the model human aorta with uniform entry as well as with centrally occluding valves mounted at the root of the aorta was described in Part I of this two-paper sequence. Part II deals with the flow development in the model aorta with tilting disc valves mounted at the root of the aorta. Bjork-Shiley and Hall-Kaster tilting disc valves were mounted in three different orientations with respect to the root of the aorta. The velocity profiles and turbulent stresses were measured with laser-Doppler anemometry. Our results under steady flow conditions in the model human aorta show quantitatively that the flow development in the ascending aorta as well as in the brachio-cephalic artery are strongly dependent on the orientation of the tilting disc valves. With the valves tilting towards the outer wall of curvature, our results suggest a tendency for flow separation at the flow divider region of the brachio-cephalic artery.

In particular he highlights the references by UDCs to "community involvement' and even the LDDC are providing a community line in recognizing the "lasting regeneration will only be achieved by improving the quality of life for everyone who lives and works in Docklands'. He argues that it remains akin to American-style growth coalitions, bringing together partnerships which solely comprise development elites. In this sense, he is pessimistic about the future of local authority involvement in urban regeneration, predicting their retention of a facilitative role but with little or no control over the regeneration process. -from Editors

AB  - The objective has been to study turbulent boundary layers under adverse pres- sure gradients ({APG}) through direct numerical simulation ({DNS}). The numer- ical code is based on a pseudo-spectral technique which is suitable for the sim- ple geometry (ﬂat plate) considered here. A large eﬀort has been put into the optimization of the numerical code on various super computers. Five large sim- ulations have been performed, ranging from a zero pressure gradient boundary layer to a separating ﬂow. The simulations have revealed many features of {APG} turbulent boundary layers which are diﬃcult to capture in experiments. Espe- cially the near-wall behavior has been investigated thoroughly, both through the statistical and instantaneous ﬂow. Theoretical work based on the turbulent boundary layer equation has been conducted with the aim to develop near-wall laws suitable for turbulence mod- els. The conditions for self-similarity and relations between mean ﬂow pa- rameters have been reviewed and applied in the {DNS}. The results from the simulations have conﬁrmed the theoretical part of this work. The turbulent ﬂows have also been investigated using turbulence models. A boundary layer under strong {APG} is diﬃcult to predict correctly, and the separating boundary layer is one of the most diﬃcult ﬂows in this respect. The near-wall damping was improved by comparing {DNS} data and model predic- tions. The asymptotic behavior of an {APG} boundary layer for large Reynolds numbers has been determined through asymptotic analysis and with the aid of turbulence models. The {DNS} data have also been utilized for the investigation of instanta- neous turbulence structures. The turbulent boundary layer was found to be populated by near-wall low-speed streaks and vortices shaped like a horseshoe, in agreement with earlier investigations. The instability mechanism behind the formation of these vortices is examined through a simulation of an artiﬁcial low-speed streak introduced in a laminar boundary layer. The turbulence statistics from the simulations have also been compared with other simulations of turbulent boundary layers and Couette ﬂow.

AB  - The purpose of the present study is to investigate the detailed mechanism of the wall-bounded compressible turbulent flow. In particular, the wall-bounded flow with an adiabatic wall is not still understood in spite of its engineering importance. To clarify the flow near the adiabatic wall and the difference between those near isothermal and adiabatic walls for the compressible turbulent flow, the compressible turbulent channel flow between adiabatic and isothermal walls is investigated. This flow can be a very useful framework for the present objective, since it is the simplest turbulent channel flow with an adiabatic wall and provides ideal information for modeling the compressible turbulent flow near the adiabatic wall. Note that the mean flow in the compressible channel flow between adiabatic walls does not approach a stationary state if there is no artificial heat sink. A new Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) algorithm based on B-spline collocation method is proposed to perform the DNS of the compressible turbulent channel flow between adiabatic and isothermal walls, since it is difficult to simulate the flow accurately and efficiently using the existing DNS algorithm for the wall-bounded compressible turbulent flow. The reliability of the present DNS algorithm is confirmed by comparing our result with that of Coleman et al. (1995) for the compressible turbulent channel flow between isothermal walls. The DNS of the compressible turbulent channel flow between adiabatic and isothermal walls is stably performed by using the constructed DNS algorithm, and then the first DNS data of this flow is obtained. This is the novel result of the present study. Mean profiles, turbulence statistics and energy transfers are investigated by using the present DNS results. i ii Acknowledgements To compare compressible and incompressible turbulent channel flows, the DNS of the incompressible turbulent channel flow with passive scalar transport between adiabatic and isothermal walls is also carried out. This flow is one of three specific situations between which Teitel & Antonia (1993) distinguished. The DNS of the incompressible turbulent flow between isothermal walls, which corresponds to that of Kim & Moin (1989), is performed for comparison. The main results obtained in this study may be stated as follows. We propose the DNS algorithm which can simulate the turbulent channel flow between adiabatic and isothermal walls accurately and efficiently. The reliable results of this flow are firstly obtained by the present DNS. The mean velocity and temperature near adiabatic and isothermal walls for the compressible turbulent channel flow can be explained using the non-dimensional heat flux and the friction Mach number. Morkovin?s hypothesis is not applicable to the near-wall asymptotic behavior of the wall-normal turbulence intensity even if the variable property effect is taken into account. Although the compressibility terms of the turbulent kinetic energy equation have slight contribution to the energy transfer, the dominant term of them transfers the turbulent kinetic energy to the mean flow near the isothermal wall and transfers the energy from the mean flow to the turbulent flow near the adiabatic wall. The pressure work which is dominant in the compressibility term of the mean kinetic energy equation exchanges the internal energy for mean kinetic energy near the isothermal wall and exchanges the mean kinetic energy for internal energy near the adiabatic wall. The thermodynamic dissipation term which is dominant in the compressible part of the turbulent energy dissipation is not negligible in the region very close to the isothermal wall. The near-wall streak structures of compressible and are comparable and are independent of the thermal wall boundary condition, when the variable property effect is taken into consideration. Morkovin?s hypothesis is not applicable to the correlation coefficient between velocity and temperature fluctuations near the adiabatic wall.

AB  - Measurements of wall shear stress of turbulent boundary layers in the channel flow were carried out using a micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS)-based micro-shear stress imaging chip. The study was carried out in a turbulent channel flow facility. One array of 25 micro-shear stress sensors in the chip that covers a length of 7.5 mm is used to measure the instantaneous span-wise distribution of the surface shear stress. The characteristics of high shear stress area (streaks) were described with statistics. Based on the measurement, the physical quantities associated with the high shear stress streaks, such as their length, width with the high shear stress level, were obtained. To further explore the relationship between the shear stress slope and the peak shear stress, the probability density function (PDF) of the ratio of peak shear stress to shear stress slope at different Reynolds number Re is examined. As for the distribution of PDF, it was found that the distribution concentrated towards a certain value in each Re. This result is extremely important because it points to the possibility of predicting the peak shear stress level based on the shear stress distribution at the leading edge of the streaks.

AB  - The urban proportion of China's population is forecast to increase from 30.2% (319 million) in 1995 to 49.1% (711.7 million) in 2020. During the same period car ownership in cities is forecast to increase by 1,000%, i.e. ten times more. Urban traffic congestion is becoming rapidly worse. It is already a major constraint on urban productivity and sustainability and it is impeding improvement in the quality of life. Most urbanised cities have experienced serious traffic congestion. In some large cities, the duration of congestion, the size of congested areas and their number are on the rise. Vehicular air and noise pollution is increasing, contributing significantly to greenhouse gases (GHG) and global warming and posing a serious health threat to urban populations. Urban transport energy consumption has been growing steadily. Shares of traditional NMT (non motorised transport) modes, especially bicycle transport, are decreasing in response to both longer travel distances (brought about by an unprecedented urbanisation and urban sprawl pattern) and problems inherent in sharing road space with more cars. Much of the erstwhile NMT traffic is presently shifting to public transport modes, predominantly the bus. However, public transport services are poor in many cities. The development of public transport is often hindered by a lack of capacity, slow operating speeds, outdated equipment and outdated management practices. Urban commuters have been experiencing longer traveling times by using the bus. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Shear velocity u* is an important parameter in geophysical flows, in particular with respect to sediment transport dynamics. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of applying five standard methods [the logarithmic mean velocity profile, the Reynolds stress profile, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profile, the wall similarity and spectral methods] that were initially developed to estimate shear velocity in smooth bed flow to turbulent flow over a loose bed of coarse gravel (D50=15 cm) under sub-threshold conditions. The analysis is based on quasi-instantaneous three-dimensional (3D) full depth velocity profiles with high spatial and temporal resolution that were measuredwith an Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP) in an open channel. The results of the analysis confirmthe importance of detailed velocity profile measurements for the determination of shear velocity in rough-bed flows. Results from all methods fall into a range of 20%variability and no systematic trend betweenmethods was observed. Local and temporal variation in the loose bed roughness may contribute to the variability of the logarithmic profile method results. Estimates obtained from the TKE and Reynolds stress methods reasonably agree.Most results from the wall similaritymethod are within 10%of those obtained by the TKE and Reynolds stress methods. The spectral method was difficult to use since the spectral energy of the vertical velocity component strongly increased with distance from the bed in the inner layer. This made the choice of the reference level problematic. Mean shear stress for all experiments follows a quadratic relationship with the mean velocity in the flow. The wall similarity method appears to be a promising tool for estimating shear velocity under rough-bed flow conditions and in field studies where other methods may be difficult to apply. This method allows for the determination of u* from a single point measurement at one level in the intermediate range (03<h<06). Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by 133Xe clearance simultaneously with the velocity of blood flow through the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) over a wide range of arterial PCO2 in eight normal men. Average arterial PCO2, which was varied by giving 4% and 6% CO2 in O2 and by controlled hyperventilation on O2, ranged from 25.3 to 49.9 mm Hg. Corresponding average values of global CBF15 were 27.2 and 65.0 ml 100 g min-1, respectively, whereas MCA blood-flow velocity ranged from 42.8 to 94.2 cm/s. The relationship of CBF to MCA blood-flow velocity over the imposed range of arterial PCO2 was described analytically by a parabola with the equation: CBF = 22.8 - 0.17 x velocity + 0.006 x velocity2 The observed data indicate that MCA blood-flow velocity is a useful index of CBF response to change in arterial PCO2 during O2 breathing at rest. With respect to baseline values measured while breathing 100% O2 spontaneously, percent changes in velocity were significantly smaller than corresponding percent changes in CBF at increased levels of arterial PCO2 and larger than CBF changes at the lower arterial PCO2. These observed relative changes are consistent with MCA vasodilation at the site of measurement during exposure to progressive hypercapnia and also during extreme hyperventilation hypocapnia.

AB  - The objective of this paper is twofold: (i) to present and analyze particle temperature statistics in turbulent non-isothermal fully-developed turbulent gas-solid channel flow for a large range of particle inertia in order to better understand particle heat transfer mechanisms; (ii) to examine the performance of a recent Probability Density Function (PDF) model provided by Zaichik et al. (2011) [1]. In order to achieve such objectives, a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) coupled with a Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) was used to collect fluid and particle temperature statistics after particles reach a statistically stationary regime. A non-monotonic behavior of particle temperature statistics is observed as inertia increases. The competition between different mechanisms (filtering inertia effect, preferential concentration, production of fluctuating quantities induced by the presence of the mean velocity and/or mean temperature gradients) are responsible for such a behavior. This competition is investigated from the exact transport equations of particle temperature statistical moments, fluid statistics conditionally-averaged at particle location, and instantaneous particle distribution in the flow field. Using these data, the accuracy of a PDF model is also assessed in the second part. From this assessment, it is seen that, despite the assumptions made, the model leads to a satisfactory prediction of most of the particle temperature statistics for not too high particle inertia. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Numerical solutions of conservation equations are obtained for turbulent flow of non-Newtonian fluids in a circular tube. The forward marching procedure of Patankar and Spalding1 was implemented in order to obtain the simultaneous development of the velocity and temperature fields by using the apparent viscosity of fluids. Prandtl's mixing length concept is used to determine the apparent turbulent shearing stress. Furthermore, local and average Nusselt numbers are obtained in the entrance region, as well as in the fully developed region. For the case of the fully developed region, values of the Nusselt numbers are compared both with the experimental data and empirical correlations

AB  - We perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent bubble-laden channel flow of shear Reynolds number Re?? = 131 to analyse mass transfer in a parallel plate electrochemical reactor. We set aside the electrochemical part of the problem and focus on the simulation of a turbulent channel flow of a liquid electrolyte with gas bubbles evolving from an electrode located at the bottom wall of the channel. We use an Eulerian-Lagrangian representation to simulate dispersed two-phase flow, where two-way momentum coupling between the bubbles and the electrolyte is taken into account. Three-dimensional simulations are obtained using a distributed memory parallel computer architecture. Investigations on the bubble motion due to advection and gravitational rise are carried out and the interaction of bubbles with turbulent flow structures is analysed. Furthermore, the role of the lift force acting on the bubbles is investigated. Mean volume fraction statistics are shown for validation purposes. An analysis of instantaneous flow fields and bubble distributions as well as order-of-magnitude analyses are used to determine which forces are mostly influencing the bubble dynamics and dispersion. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A two-parameter variational method is introduced to calculate pressure drop and heat transfer for turbulent flow in ducts. The variational method leads to: a Galerkin-type solution for the momentum and energy equations. The method uses the Prandtl mixing length theory to describe turbulent shear stress. The Van Driest model is compared with experimental data and incorporated in the numerical calculations. The computed velocity profiles, pressure drop, and heat transfer coefficient are compared with,the experimental data of various investigators for fully developed turbulent flow in parallel plate ducts and pipes. This analysis leads to development of a Green's function useful for solving a variety of conjugate heat transfer problems.

AB  - We investigate two different discretization approaches of a model optimal-control problem, chosen to be relevant for control of instabilities in shear flows. In the first method, a fully discrete approach has been used, together with a finite-element spatial discretization, to obtain the objective function gradient in terms of a discretely-derived adjoint equation. In the second method, Chebyshev collocation is used for spatial discretization, and the gradient is approximated by discretizing the continuously-derived adjoint equation. The discrete approach always results in a faster convergence of the conjugate-gradient optimization algorithm. Due to the shear in the convective velocity, a low diffusivity in the problem complicates the structure of the computed optimal control, resulting in particularly noticeable differences in convergence rate between the methods. When the diffusivity is higher, the control becomes less complicated, and the difference in convergence rate reduces. The use of approximate gradients results in a higher sensitivity to the degrees of freedom in time. When the system contains a strong instability, it only takes a few iteration to obtain an effective control for both methods,even if there are differences in the formal convergence rate. This indicates that it is possible to use the approximative gradients of the objective function in cases where the control problem mainly consists of controlling strong instabilities.

AB  - The use of magnesium (Mg) alloys has been mainly hindered by its low elastic modulus, limited cold workability and toughness, and susceptibility to corrosion 1. Formability and ductility limitations at low temperatures are largely a result of the hexagonal close packed (HCP) crystal structure's tendency to deform through twinning rather than slip mechanism due to the lack of five independent slip systems 1-3 required for homogeneous plastic deformation as defined by the von Mises criterion 4. Mg alloy formability can be improved at elevated temperatures through the activation of additional slip systems. This leads to the need for better understanding of Mg alloy deformation at elevated temperatures and, specifically, the flow stress behavior at elevated temperatures so that processing improvements can potentially be developed for industrial magnesium extrusions.

AB  - An international comparative study of the relations among the process of urbanization, urban concentration and economic development, and income distribution was performed by using data of developing and developed countries. Cross-section analyses at certain time periods for capturing "long-run" effects as well as time-series analyses for some countries for "short-run" effects were done taking advantage of the "rectangular" array of data. There were several interesting results: the pattern of unemployment rate in most developing countries shows an inverted-U shaped curve with respect to the degree of urbanization; the pattern of urban concentration is in the form of an inverted-U with respect to the economic development level; and the degree of inequality of income distribution seems to react in an inverted-U form to the variances in the extent of urbanization.

AB  - This article presents comparisons between predictions, obtained during the course of this investigation, and recently produced measurements of the flow development through a square cross-sectioned U-bend of strong curvature, Rc/D = 0.65, that is either stationary or in orthogonal rotation. For the stationary case, four turbulence models have been tested; a high-Re k-ε model interfaced with the low-Re 1-equation model in the near-wall regions, a high-Re algebraic second-moment (ASM) closure with the low-Re 1-equation model in the near-wall regions, and two versions of a low-Re ASM model. The two low-Re ASM models return noticeably better predictions of the flow development. There is, however further scope for improvement, especially in the downstream section. Two rotating flow cases have been computed both with the axis of rotation parallel to the axis of bend curvature; one at a positive rotation number Ro ≡ ΩD/Wb of 0.2 and one at Ro ≡ -0.2. In the case of positive rotation, where the Coriolis and curvature forces reinforce each other, the flow predictions of the low-Re ASM are in very close agreement with the data. When the U-bend rotates negatively, the complex flow field generated in the downstream section is not well reproduced by the low-Re ASM model. More refined turbulence models are thus necessary when the curvature and Coriolis forces oppose each other.

Pieterse argues that the current "shelter for all" and "urban good governance" policies treat only the symptoms of the problem. Instead, he claims, there is an urgent need to reinvigorate civil society in these cities, to encourage radical democracy, economic resilience, social resistance and environmental sustainability folded into the everyday concerns of marginalized people.

AB  - An experimental flow visualization study of the entrance section of channels formed with sinusoidal plates was made. The experiments were conducted in a water tunnel and a laser illuminated particle tracking was used as the technique of flow visualization. The geometric parameters of the plates were maintained constant while the distance between plates, phase angle, and the Reynolds number were varied during the experiments. The flow regimes that were found in the experiments are steady, unsteady and significantly-mixed flows. Instabilities of the flow first appear near the exit of the channel, and move closer to the inlet waves as the Reynolds number grows, but in the first wave from inlet the flow is always steady. The results show that, for all other parameters fixed, the Reynolds number at which unsteady flow first appears grows with the distance between plates. The phase angle that best promotes unsteady flow depends on the average distance between plates: for certain average distance between plates, there is a phase angle that best disturbs the flow. For the set of parameters used in this experiment, a channel with eight waves is sufficiently long and the flow features presented in the first eight waves of a longer channel will be similar to what was observed here. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Environmental research on aquatic microorganisms, such as phytoplankton, aquatic bacteria, and aquatic viruses, often takes advantage of their natural chlorophyll, phycobilins, and other intrinsic fluorescent pigments. Although epifluorescence microscopy is still used frequently, flow cytometry has become a key research tool due to its ability to provide multiparametric analysis at the single-cell level. Along with the analytical opportunities flow cytometry has brought to the field, aquatic microorganism research poses certain technical challenges as well. These include a large variation in organism size, analysis of unfiltered samples, the generation of complex multiparametric data across a wide dynamic fluorescence range, the need for quantification, and a difficult operational environment. This white paper explores both the opportunities and challenges of aquatic research, and examines how the BD Accuri™ C6 flow cytometer is well suited for this work. The final section of this paper is a “field guide” to using the BD Accuri C6 in aquatic microorganism research. It describes how to detect natural fluorophores such as chlorophyll, phycocyanins, and phycoerythrin (PE), and how to use fluorescence profiles to identify cyanobacteria, other autotrophic phytoplankton, and heterotrophic bacteria and viruses. Several examples illustrate the BD Accuri C6 cytometer’s role in ongoing field research in the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, the Netherlands, and Antarctica.

AB  -  ABSTRACT This study examines the structure of shear stress and turbulent\nkinetic energy (TKE) flux across the roughness layer of a uniform,\nfully rough gravel-bed channel flow (ks+ 100, lemy &amp; Hurther\n(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 618, 2009, p. 279), (b) the global and per\nclass DA conditional statistics of shear stress and associated TKE\nflux and (c) the contribution of large-scale coherent shear stress\nstructures (LC3S) to the TKE flux across the roughness layer. The\nmean Reynolds and dispersive shear structure show good agreement\nbetween the protuberance bed zones associated with the S-shape/accelerated\nclasses and recent results obtained in standard k-type rough-wall\nflows (Djenidi et al., Exp. Fluids, vol. 44, 2008, p. 37; Pokrajac,\nMcEwan &amp; Nikora, Exp. Fluids, vol. 45, 2008, p. 73). These gravel-bed\nprotuberances act as local flow obstacles inducing a strong turbulent\nactivity in their wake regions. The conditional statistics show that\nthe Reynolds stress contribution is fairly well distributed between\nsweep and ejection events, with threshold values ranging from H =\n0 to H = 8. However, the TKE flux across the roughness layer primarily\nresults from the residual shear stress between ejection and sweep\nof very high magnitude (H = 10&#8211;20) and of small turbulent scale.\nAlthough LC3S are seen to penetrated the interfacial roughness layer,\ntheir TKE flux contribution is found to be negligible compared to\nthe very energetic small-scale sweep events. These sweeps are dominantly\nproduced in the bed zones of local gravel protuberances where the\nvelocity profiles are inflexional of S-shape type and the mean flow\nproperties are of mixing-layer flow type as previously shown in Mignot\net al. (2009).

AB  - The entrance conditions for pulsatile flow are important in the understanding blood flow out of the heart and in developing regions at branches. The pulsatile entrance flow was solved using a spectral element simulation of the full unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. A mean Reynolds number of 200 and a range of Womersley parameters from 1.8 to 12.5 was used for a sinusoidal inlet flow waveform 1 + sin (omega t). Variations in the entrance length were observed during the pulsatile cycle. The amplitude of the entrance length variation decreased with an increase in the Womersley parameter. The phase lag between the entrance length and the inlet flow waveform increased for Womersley parameter alpha up to 5.0 and decreased for alpha larger than 5.0. For low alpha, the maximum entrance length during pulsatile flow was approximately the same as the steady entrance length for the peak flow. For high varies; is directly proportional to, the pulsatile entrance length was more uniform during the cycle and tended to the entrance length for the mean flow. The wall shear rate reached its far downstream value after only about half of the entrance length and also exhibited a dependence on alpha. The results quantify the entrance conditions typically encountered in studies of the arterial system.

AB  - Void fraction, Taylor bubble and liquid slug lengths, and slug frequency are parameters essential to any description of the structure of slug flow. In the present study, these parameters were extracted from the time series of cross-sectionally averaged void fraction obtained from two vertical facilities having similar internal pipe diameter but significantly different axial lengths; 51.2 mm/3.5 m and 52.3 mm/9 m. In order to study slug flow, the flow rates for which it occurred were first identified. To investigate the effect of flow development on slug characteristics measurements were carried out at several axial locations from the mixing section for both facilities. For slug frequency, a new correlation including the effect of the axial length has been proposed and assessed using previously published data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In light of differences in optical flow fields generated by movements of two-dimensional planes and three-dimensional objects, we proposed a new liveness detection method for face recognition. Under the assumption that the test region is a two-dimensional plane, we can obtain a reference field from the actual optical flow field data. Then the degree of differences between the two fields can be used to distinguish between a three-dimensional face and a two-dimensional photograph. Empirical study shows that the proposed approach is both feasible and effective

AB  - Despite considerable research on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and conditions associated with unexplained chronic fatigue (CF), little is known about their prevalence and demographic distribution in the population. The present study describes the epidemiology and characteristics of self-reported CF and related conditions in a diverse urban community. The study used a cross-sectional telephone screening survey of households in San Francisco, followed by interviews with fatigued and nonfatigued residents. Respondents who appeared to meet case definition criteria for CFS, based on self-reported fatigue characteristics, symptoms, and medical history, were classified as CFS-like cases. Subjects who reported idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) that did not meet CFS criteria were classified as ICF-like cases. Screening interviews were completed for 8,004 households, providing fatigue and demographic information for 16,970 residents. Unexplained CF was extremely rare among household residents <18 years of age, but was reported by 2% of adult respondents. A total of 33 adults (0.2% of the study population) were classified as CFS-like cases and 259 (1.8%) as ICF-like cases. Neither condition clustered within households. CFS- and ICF-like illnesses were most prevalent among women and persons with annual household incomes below $40,000, and least prevalent among Asians. The prevalence of CFS-like illness was elevated among African Americans, Native Americans, and persons engaged in clerical occupations. Although CFS-like cases were more severely ill than those with ICF-like illness, a similar symptom pattern was observed in both groups. In conclusion, conditions associated with unexplained CF occur in all sociodemographic groups but appear to be most prevalent among women, persons with lower income, and some racial minorities.

AB  - A new technique is presented for measuring instantaneous flow rates in unsteady laminar duct flows. It is based on a relationship between flow rate and centerline-velocity history that is an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for parallel, fully-developed flow of constant-property Newtonian fluids undergoing arbitrary unsteadiness from an initially steady state. The method applies instantaneously in both forward and reversing flow and invokes the sole additional assumption that the flow is axisymmetric. The capabilities of the technique are demonstrated by using experimental measurements of the centerline velocity in a tube upstream of a fuel injector, during a series of sequential injections, to: (i) quantify the differences in the fuel masses injected in each event; and (ii) measure the cumulative masses injected over multiple events. They were found to be in good agreement with direct measurements made with a mass balance. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Poverty dominates the international development agenda of the 21st century. The improvement of the health and living conditions of millions of slum dwellers around the world is a primary concern of the current Millennium Development Goals for reducing poverty. Up to the 1980s poverty was largely associated with the rural areas in developing countries; but the situation has changed with the dramatic increase in the numbers and proportion of the population living in urban areas, and a corresponding increase in the level of urban poverty. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that the proportion of the urban work force engaged in the informal sector is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and accounts for more than 50% of urban employment in two-thirds of the countries surveyed in 1999. Irregular settlements also have become so pervasive that they seem to outnumber legally planned development, and their social legitimacy appears to be no longer in question. Unfortunately, the appalling environmental conditions associated with informal sector activities and settlements constitute a major threat to the health and well-being of urban life.

AB  - In this paper the influence of small droplets, with radius 10−8m < r < 10−6 m, on laminar and turbulent boundary layer behavior is considered. It is found that the laminar boundary layer in a two-phase flow with strongly dispersed liquid retains dissipation energy and that the recovery factor of enthalpy is greater than unity. In turbulent boundary layers small droplets are transported by turbulent diffusion and this leads to the recovery factor being less than unity. Its value in both cases depends mainly on the nondimensional number Ds = CLeL/(Ue2/2). The laminar boundary layer solution for non-equilibrium two-phase flow is obtained. Profiles of the droplet mass fraction, vapour and droplets temperatures and droplet radius are computed for the case of a steady two-dimensional flow. The turbulent boundary layer is treated using a semi-empirical theory assuming thermodynamic equilibrium.

Design/methodology/approach - The large eddy simulation (LES) and SIMPLE-C method coupled with preconditioned conjugate gradient methods have been applied to the turbulent flow field and heat transfer enhancement of mixed convection in a block-heated channel. Findings - Provides information about heat transfer performance indicating that heat transfer performance can be affected by various width-to-height ratio of turbulator and Grasehof numbers with a constant Reynolds number. The results show that the installation of turbulator in cross-flow above an upstream block can effectively enhance the heat transfer performance by suitable width-to-height ratio of turbulator and Grasehof numbers.

AB  - The size effects on microscale single-phase fluid flow and heat transfer are reviewed and discussed. The physical mechanisms for the size effects on the microchannel flow and heat transfer were divided into two classifications: (a) The gas rarefaction effect occurs when the continuum assumption breaks down as the characteristic length of the flow becomes comparable to the mean free path of the molecules; (b) Variations of the predominant factors influence the relative importance of various phenomena on the flow and heat transfer as the characteristic length decreases, even if the continuum assumption is still valid. Due to the larger surface to volume ratio for microchannels, factors related to surface area have more impact to the microscale flow and heat transfer. Among them are: The surface friction induced flow compressibility in microchannels makes the fluid velocity profiles flatter and leads to higher friction factors and Nusselt numbers; The surface roughness of the microchannel is likely responsible for the early transition from laminar to turbulent flow and the increased friction factor and Nusselt number; The importance of viscous force in natural convection modifies the correlation between Nu and Ra for natural convection in a microenclosure and, other effects, such as the axial heat conduction in the channel wall, the channel surface geometry, and measurement errors as well, could lead to different flow and heat transfer behaviors from that at conventional scales.

AB  - The effect of the free-stream velocity profile on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow on a flat plate was studied experimentally and numerically and it is presented in this paper. The flows investigated are based on the T3L test case of the ERCOFTAC Special Investigation Group for transition. According to this test case, the boundary layer development on a flat plate with a semi-circular leading edge is examined by means of transition due to separation, under various free-stream conditions concerning the turbulence intensity and velocity magnitude. In the present work, two free-stream velocity distributions were studied. The first was a uniform velocity one and the second, with a mean shear velocity profile with positive gradient, ?????/???y = 27.7 s-1. Measurements using hot-wire anemometry were taken in two primary regions: far upstream of the flat plate to observe the velocity and turbulence distributions and near the flat plate to capture the boundary layer development and the transition phenomenon. The effect of the two free-stream velocity distributions was studied and it was shown that for both velocity distributions a recirculation region of the flow occurred near the flat plate wall that led to transition dominated by the boundary layer separation. For the positive velocity gradient the separation region was smaller compared to the case of uniform free-stream profile. Both cases were also studied computationally. Two widely used linear eddy-viscosity turbulence models, the k-?? and the k-?? with specific low Reynolds formulations were applied and in addition, a non-linear eddy-viscosity based on the k-?? model has been implemented. In general, all the k-?? models gave satisfactory predictions for both flow cases regarding the predicted velocity distributions, while the k-?? model gave poor results. Concerning the longitudinal Reynolds stress distributions in the near-wall region, the non-linear k-?? model gave the best predictions inside the separation zone but it over predicted the corresponding values beyond the reattachment point while beyond the separation the linear models predicted the longitudinal stresses in a more satisfactory way. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The influence of riser diameter on the axial and radial solids flux and flow development is studied in three riser circulating fluidized bed reactors of different diameters (76, 100 and 203 mm i.d. risers). A suction probe was used for the direct measurement, while the calculated local solids flux data obtained from solids velocity and concentration measured by two separate fibre optic probes were used to compare. Two shapes were found for the radial profile of the solids flux, a parabolic shape and a flat core shape. The shapes obtained could be predicted, based on the operating conditions, using a new concept of the effective solids saturation carrying capacity. The radial profile of solids flux is less uniform in a larger riser than in a smaller riser. Flow development is slower with the increase of riser diameter. The operating conditions were found to affect the solids flux in each reactor in the same general fashion: increasing gas velocity decreased the amount of downflow solids in the risers; increases in the solids circulation rate caused more solids to flow downwards. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The flow development of Herschel-Bulkley fluids in a sudden three-dimensional square expansion is studied numerically. The flow is modeled using the mixed-Galerkin finite element formulation to solve the conservation of mass and momentum equations. The Herschel-Bulkley material behavior is described using a regularized model based on the Papanastasiou model. Solutions are obtained for a downstream-to-upstream expansion ratio of 2:1 and for a wide range of pressure gradient values and rheological parameters. The results show that, during the evolution of the flow, two core regions and dead zones at the corners are formed. The extent of the core regions decreases with the pressure gradient and the Reynolds number, and increases with the power-law index. It is also found that the volume flow rate at steady flow increases with the pressure gradient, power-law index, and Reynolds number. (C) 1999 The Society of Rheology. [S0148-6055(99)02103-3].

AB  - The main objectives of this study are to suggest a proper boundary condition at the interface between a permeable block and turbulent channel flow and to investigate the characteristics of turbulent channel flow with permeable walls. The boundary condition suggested is an extended version of that applied to laminar channel flow by Beavers & Joseph (1967) and describes the behaviour of slip velocities in the streamwise and spanwise directions at the interface between the permeable block and turbulent channel flow. With the proposed boundary condition, direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow that is bounded by the permeable wall are performed and significant skin-friction reductions at the permeable wall are obtained with modification of overall flow structures. The viscous sublayer thickness is decreased and the near-wall vortical structures are significantly weakened by the permeable wall. The permeable wall also reduces the turbulence intensities, Reynolds shear stress, and pressure and vorticity fluctuations throughout the channel except very near the wall. The increase of some turbulence quantities there is due to the slip-velocity fluctuations at the wall. The boundary condition proposed for the permeable wall is validated by comparing solutions with those obtained from a separate direct numerical simulation using both the Brinkman equation for the interior of a permeable block and the Navier-Stokes equation for the main channel bounded by a permeable block.

AB  - DNS simulations of two-phase turbulent bubbly channel flow at Res = 180 (Reynolds number based on friction velocity and channel half-width) were performed using a stabilized finite element method (FEM) and a level set approach to track the air/water interfaces. Fully developed turbulent single-phase solutions obtained previously using the same stabilized FEM code were used as the initial flow field, and an appropriate level-set distance field was introduced to rep- resent the air bubbles. Surface tension and gravity forces were used in the simulations to physically rep- resent the behavior of a bubbly air/water two-phase flow having a liquid/gas density ratio of 858.3. The simulation results were averaged to obtain the liquid and gas mean velocity distributions, the local void fractions as well as the local turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate of the liquid phase. The liquid phase parameters were compared with the corresponding single-phase turbulent channel flow to determine the bubbles’ influence on the turbulence field. 

AB  - An anisotropic Lagrangian approach is used to investigate the influence of a mean fluid velocity gradient on the motion and on the dispersion of heavy particles suspended in a stationary homogeneous turbulent gas flow. The problem of consistency of the correlation matrices used in first-order stochastic processes is put forward. The accuracy of the method is first checked by comparing the numerical predictions with available experimental results in uniform flow. A second validation test is carried out by comparison with dispersion measurements in a horizontal shear flow. Numerical predictions are then provided in the case of a vertical upward turbulent shear flow, the gravity force field implying a non-zero mean drift velocity between fluid and particles. The transverse particle dispersion is found to be slightly reduced by the presence of a uniform shear. The streamwise particle turbulent intensity is enhanced above the level predicted without shear, whereas, in the direction normal to the flow, the fluctuating velocity of particles are found to be unaffected by the presence of shear. The effect of the lift force due to the mean shear is found to be negligible, except for the mean transverse deviation, which is found however not to be caused only by the lift. The presented numerical results, which confirm and extend the theoretical analysis of others, may explain some experimental observations reported in the literature.

AB  - Second-moment closure predictions of developing turbulent flow in a plane channel subjected to rapid spanwise rotation are compared with experimental results. Near-wall effects are modelled by elliptic relaxation. Rapid pressure-strain interactions are accounted for by a non-linear, cubic model which employs variable coefficients and is consistent with the principle of material frame indifference (MFI) in the limit of two-dimensional turbulence. It is shown that the rotational-induced effect of the Coriolis force on the developing mean flow field and the turbulence quantities is well reproduced by the present approach. It is particularly encouraging that the experimentally observed relaminarization on the stabilized suction side of the channel could be predicted well. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Wastewater and waste heat are frequently discharged into ambient water and affect the water quality there. An accurate evaluation of the turbulent mixing and dispersion processes is one of the key factors for assessing the environmental impact of these discharges. To achieve this objective a three-dimensional numerical model incorporating the method of Large Eddy Simulation has been developed. In this method the large scale turbulence is computed explicitly and the subgrid scale turbulence is modelled. The empiricism incurred for the specification of the dispersion and turbulent mixing coefficients is thus reduced to minimal. The governing equations are split into three parts in the finite difference solution: advection, dispersion and propagation. The advection part is solved by a characteristics-based scheme. The dispersion part is solved by the central difference method and the propagation part is solved implicitly by using the Gauss-Seidel. iteration method. The model has been applied to simulate a continuous line source in free surface shear flow. The computed results demonstrate the existence of the non-Fickian diffusion and dispersion region close to the source. Further downstream the transverse diffusion process obeys Fick's Law and the transverse diffusion coefficient is in agreement with the empirical value measured in laboratory. The initial non-Fickian diffusion and dispersion region is further analysed based the coherence of the velocity data. The dispersion coefficient is found to follow the Okubo's 4/3 power law, but with a much larger coefficient owing to the shear effect.

AB  - Numerical predictions of a hydrodynamic and thermally developed turbulent flow are presented for a stationary duct with square ribs aligned normal to the main flow direction. The rib height to channel hydraulic diameter (e/Dh) is 0.1, the rib pitch to rib height (P/e) is 10 and the calculations have been carried out for a bulk Reynolds number of 20,000. The capability of the detached eddy simulation (DES) version of the 1988 k-?? model has been validated in predicting the turbulent flow field and the heat transfer in a complete two pass channel. Results of mean flow quantities, secondary flows, friction and heat transfer are compared to experiments and large-eddy simulations (LES). It is concluded that in spite of shortcomings in predicting transition correctly at the entrance to the duct, DES surpasses the base capability of the underlying RANS model and predicts flow and heat transfer with good accuracy in a flow which is dominated by separation and reattachment of shear layers, unsteady vortex induced secondary motions, and strong streamline curvature. In all aspects it reproduces the correct physics and shows good quantitative comparisons with LES and experiments while reducing the computational complexity by nearly an order of magnitude. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Numerical calculations of a lifted H2=N2 turbulent jet flame in a vitiated coflow of hot gases are presented. The calculations are per- formed using Magnussen's Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) for tur- bulent combustion, and are an extension to previously reported EDC modeling results presented by Cabra et al. (2002). Four dif ferent tur- bulence models are employed to investigate in more detail the turbu- lence modeling ef fect on the EDC combustion model with detailed chemistry. A series of simulations are presented that indicate the extent to which turbulence models influence the predicted lift-of f height with the EDC combustion model. Several flow conditions were tested. For all calculations, EDC predicts more lift-of f by using the standard k-e model than by using Reynolds-stress-equation (RSE) models, whereas a modified k-e model predicts less lift-of f than the RSE models. The reason for the lower predicted lift-of f with the modified k-e model is because a modified turbulence Prandtl or Schmidt number in the scalar equations in the modified k-e model allows an earlier mixing of the hot coflow with the fuel jet. All models overpredict the lift-of f height for the standard flow conditions. Recent experiments and numerical calculations by others have shown that the vitiated coflow flame is extremely sensitive to variations in the coflow temperature. The present calculations show that this sensi- tivity is captured by the EDC combustion model, however to a smaller degree than that previously reported. Calculations with variations in coflow temperature and jet flow velocity indicate that for each flow con- dition, the various turbulence models predict the same percentage increase or decrease in lift-off height. These EDC calculations show that the turbulence model effect on the EDC predicted lift-off height is important and that a better flame structure is predicted with the RSE model by Jones and Musonge than with the other turbulence models.

AB  - The object of this paper is to study the influence of dispersed micrometer size particles on turbulent heat transfer mechanisms in wall-bounded flows. The strategic target of the current research is to set up a methodology to size and design new-concept heat transfer fluids with properties given by those of the base fluid modulated by the presence of dynamically-interacting, suitably-chosen, discrete micro- and nano- particles. We run Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) for hydrodynamically fully-developed, thermally-developing turbulent channel flow at shear Reynolds number Re=150 and Prandtl number Pr=3, and we tracked two large swarms of particles, characterized by different inertia and thermal inertia. Preliminary results on velocity and temperature statistics for both phases show that, with respect to single-phase flow, heat transfer fluxes at the walls increase by roughly 2% when the flow is laden with the smaller particles, which exhibit a rather persistent stability against non-homogeneous distribution and near-wall concentration. An opposite trend (slight heat transfer flux decrease) is observed when the larger particles are dispersed into the flow. These results are consistent with previous experimental findings and are discussed in the frame of the current research activities in the field. Future developments are also outlined.

AB  - This chapter critically discusses the significance of the urban development corporations (UDCs) as a central component of contemporary policies for urban regeneration. An overview of the main transformations in urban policy since the late 1970s is provided, particularly focusing on changes in the organisational and fiscal context of central-local government relations. An outline of the UDS initiative is given, commenting on its origins, objectives, and financing, while also providing an assessment of some of the main transformations and continuities in UDC strategy and policy since the early 1980s. The final section outlines the main themes and issues of the book by calling for more sensitized, or contextualised, evaluations of urban programmes and policies. -from Editors

AB  - Flow and pollutant dispersion in a densely built-up area of Seoul, Korea, are numerically examined using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled to a mesoscale model [fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)]. The CFD model used is a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations model with the renormalization group k-epsilon turbulence model. A one-way nesting method is employed in this study. MM5-simulated data are linearly interpolated in time and space to provide time-dependent boundary conditions for the CFD model integration. In the MM5 simulation, four one-way nested computational domains are considered, and the innermost domain with a horizontal grid size of 1 km covers the Seoul metropolitan area and its adjacent areas, including a part of the Yellow Sea. The NCEP final analysis data are used as initial and boundary conditions for MM5. MM5 is integrated for 48 h starting from 0300 LST 1 June 2004 and the coupled CFD-MM5 model is integrated for 24 h starting from 0300 LST 2 June 2004. During the two-day period, a high-pressure system was dominant over the Korean peninsula, with clear conditions and weak synoptic winds. MM5 simulates local circulations characterized by sea breezes and mountain/valley winds. MM5-simulated synoptic weather and near-surface temperatures and winds are well matched with the observed ones. Results from the coupled CFD-MM5 model simulation show that the flow in the presence of real building clusters can change significantly as the ambient wind speed and direction change. Diurnally varying local circulations mainly cause changes in ambient wind speed and direction in the present simulation. Some characteristic flows-such as the double-eddy circulation, channeling flow, and vertical recirculation vortex-are simulated. Pollutant dispersion pattern and the degree of lateral pollutant dispersion are shown to be complicated in the presence of real building clusters and under varying ambient wind speed and direction. This study suggests that because of the sensitive dependency of urban flow and pollutant dispersion on variations in ambient wind, time-dependent boundary conditions should be used to better simulate or predict them when the ambient wind varies over the period of CFD model simulation.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the geometric effects and pulsatile characteristics during the stenotic flows in tapering arteries. Design/methodology/approach: The low Reynolds number κ- ω turbulence model is applied to describe the stenotic flows in the tapering arteries in this paper. The results are divided into two sections. The first section characterizes the geometric effects on the turbulent flow under steady condition. The second section illustrates the key physiological parameters including the pressure drop and wall stress during the periodic cycle of the pulsatile flow in the arteries. Findings: The tapering and stenoses severity intensify the turbulent flow and stretch the recirculation zones in the turbulent arterial flow. The wall shear stress, pressure drop and velocity vary most intensively at the peak phase during the periodic cycle of the pulsatile turbulent flow. Originality/value: This paper provides a comprehensive understanding of the spatial-temporal fluid dynamics involved in turbulent and transitional arterial flow with stenoses. The low Reynolds number κ- ω turbulence model method is applied for the analyses of the geometric effects on the arterial flow and fluid feature during the periodic cycle. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the response of fluid temperature within a heated pipe to imposed excursions of flow rate. Experiments are reported in which measurements of wall temperature and local fluid temperature were made with fully developed turbulent flow of water in a uniformly heated tube during and after ramp-up excursions of flow rate between steady initial and final values. The fluid temperature measurements were made using a traversable temperature probe incorporating a thermocouple capable of responding to turbulent fluctuations of temperature. Local values of mean temperature and RMS temperature fluctuation were obtained by ensemble averaging the results from many tests in which the same flow excursion was applied in a very repeatable manner with fixed values of inlet fluid temperature and heat flux. Further measurements were made under conditions of steady flow rate at a number of values over the range covered in the transient flow experiments. The results obtained in the experiments with transient flow show that there is a significant delay in the variation of ensemble-averaged wall temperature and striking perturbations in the variations of RMS fluctuation of wall temperature and local fluid temperature. These stem from the delayed response of turbulence to the imposed excursions of flow rate. They provide independent confirmation of ideas concerning the modelling of time scales for the production and diffusion of turbulence in pipe flow which were developed by the present authors in the course of earlier work. Ensemble-averaged local fluid temperature also varies in an unusual manner. Instead of falling monotonically with increase of flow rate, as might be expected, it starts to rise at some stage, reaches a peak value and then falls again. The release of heat stored in the pipe wall contributes to this behaviour. Computational simulations of the present experiments were performed using a spatially fully developed formulation of the equations for unsteady turbulent flow and heat transfer in a boundary layer utilising turbulence models of low Reynolds number, κ-ε type. Comparisons between predicted and measured variations of temperature are presented in the paper. These show that the predictions differ significantly from model to model and that detailed agreement with experiment is not obtained using any of the models. However, certain interesting features of the observed temperature variations, such as a delay in the response of outer wall temperature and perturbations in local fluid temperature, are present in the computed results.
