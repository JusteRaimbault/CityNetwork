AB  - Representative driving cycles across the Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan region illustrate a direct relationship to urban land use. Movement away from the central business district results in fewer traffic events, higher speeds longer cruise periods and shorter stops. The consequent reduction in root mean square acceleration leads to a corresponding reduction in vehicle emission factors. Urban planning implications are persued and highlight the importance of public transport as an option in reducing urban air pollution.

AB  - Urban open spaces such as parks, open squares, parkways, etc, are considered as amenity resources or local public goods and incorporated into neoclassical urban land-use theory. Models characterizing Pareto efficient allocations and competitive equilibrium allocations with open space are presented. The 'fiscal profitability principle' suggested by Margolis is confirmed to be applicable to determine an efficient distribution of open space. Many interesting results are established. For example, if utility function is Cobb~Douglas or log-linear, then rich will locate farther away from poor, irrespective of the distribution of open space; the optimal density distribution of open space is uniform if the spillover effects of open space are neglected, and it is decreasing with the distance from the CBD when the spillover effects of open space are taken into account.

AB  - Spatial structure of urban green space system has an important effect in the following aspects: configuring urban resources, controlling urban size, improving ecological quality of urban and disaster prevention and mitigation, etc. Based on the summarization of advanced spatial layout pattern, the author puts forward the compound layout pattern of &#x0022;ring-network-wedge-radiation type&#x0022; of Changsha. From two levels (planning area and city center area) and five aspects (green-ring, green-corridor, green-network, green-center and green-wedge), the paper explores the construction theory of spatial structure of urban green space system, and constructively proposes the planning ideas and methods of green-corridor width, green-center scale and green-wedge scale. These conclusions can provide scientific guidance for the planning of spatial structure of urban green space system in Changsha.

AB  - Using a satellite image processing and econometric model, the paper aims to contribute to urban surface structure efforts of addressing the question of how urban thermal environment management should be carried out. The objective is to reveal quantitatively the effect of the spatial variation of city's structure on nearsurface air temperature, which related to canopy layer heat island. The whole system mainly consists of three connected systems: automatic digital terrain surface model generation from ALOS PRISM satellite images, which has the ability to provide precise and reliable urban spatial structure parameters, and modeling the relation between urban surface structure and the near-surface air temperature variation within urban area. The model is developed based on temperature data collecting at 27 sites in Sendai, Japan. All related arguments for model specification and evaluation have been done thoroughly in this research. The results indicated that parameters related to urban spatial structure are important for governing temperature variations in urban area.

AB  - A theoretical model of the urban land market is solved to examine the impact of bimodal passenger transportation on equilibrium residential land use. In this model travel to the central business district occurs on a dense system of radial roads or bus routes and a competing system or radial expressways or mass transit lines fed by a subsidiary system of densely spread access streets. Under rational behavior assumptions for households, it is shown that various basic urban forms can result depending on the relative generalized cost characteristics of the competing dense and sparse radial networks. The basic urban forms yield fundamental shapes, differing as to the relative geometry and position of the market areas for the two modes. The standard Alonso-Muth model of unimodal travel and circular urban form is found to result as a special case in several of these cases. American llrbanized areas of various sizes and modal mix provide plausible examples for each of the basics forms. The paper concludes with a discussion of the model’s implicat,ions as a framework for examining optimum urban transport structure and the proliferation of transport routes as a fun&on of urban size.

AB  - Four hundred years of developing, shifting and changing marks the city of Dhaka with a strong culture heritage. Traditional hierarchies and organic spatial structures form a rich mix of indigenous morphology, which is obvious in historically famous and organically developed bazaar streets and commercial interfaces. The urban development of Dhaka city is well known for its spatial structure. A 'space syntax' technique is used to understand the structure, function, underlying logic, morphological growth and evolution of the urban systems. This article focuses on both the spatial dynamics of the urban structure and on the spatial nature of the bazaar streets (commercial networks) and aims to explicate the notion of the configurational analysis of urban growth. By determining the syntactic pattern and evolution of the bazaar streets, this analysis can be usefully applied to designing for future urban growth.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the first careful test of an equilibrium model of urban redevelopment. In addition, it demonstrates a new methodology for recovering vacant urban land prices in areas that have already been developed. Using data on single family detached homes sold in Vancouver, B. C., we estimate the price of vacant land based on properties that were sold and redeveloped. The price of developed land is also estimated based on properties that were sold and not redeveloped. Various tests overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that housing is redeveloped when the price of vacant land exceeds the price of land in its current use. This result provides support for various theoretical models of urban spatial growth and indicates that one can recover vacant urban land prices by examining redeveloped properties.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) and their changes have significant influence on heat balance, especially in the urban area. Therefore climate measurement stations are permanently set-up on different land uses, and additionally mobile climate measurements are carried out every year at the same time and similar climate conditions. The study area is Santiago de Chile, one of the most dynamic and fast growing cities in South America. Urban Structure Types (UST) are delineated for areas under investigation in which the urban morphology is rather characteristic for the social strata. UST are compared with climate parameters to find out if significant correlations exist between UST and climate measurements. The overall goal is to estimate environmental justice in large urban agglomerations.

AB  - The nature and form of the urban environment is a critical determinant of the sustainability of our society, as it is responsible directly for a large proportion of consumed energy, and influences indirectly the patterns and modes of energy consumed in everyday activities. We examine the current state of research into the energy and greenhouse gas emissions attributable directly or indirectly to urban form. Specifically, we look at the embodied (construction) and operational energy attributable to the construction, maintenance and use of residential dwellings, and we review the literature on the relationship between urban structure and private travel behaviour. While there is clear evidence from both intra- and inter-city comparisons that higher density, transit-oriented cities have lower per-capita transport energy use, the effect of housing density on residential (in-house) energy use is less clear. More detailed research is needed to examine the relationships between urban form and overall energy use.

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease globally and is usually associated with built environments in tropical areas. Remotely sensed information can facilitate the study of urban mosquito-borne diseases by providing multiple temporal and spatial resolutions appropriate to investigate urban structure and ecological characteristics associated with infectious disease. In this study, coarse, medium and fine resolution satellite imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and QuickBird respectively) and ground-based data were analyzed for the Greater Puntarenas area, Costa Rica for the years 2002-04. The results showed that the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generally higher in the localities with lower incidence of dengue fever during 2002, although the correlation was statistically significant only in the dry season (r=-0.40; p=0.03). Dengue incidence was inversely correlated to built area and directly correlated with tree cover (r=0.75, p=0.01). Overall, the significant correlations between dengue incidence and urban structural variables (tree cover and building density) suggest that properties of urban structure may be associated with dengue incidence in tropical urban settings.

AB  - Increased urbanization typically leads to an increase in abundance of a few species and a reduction in bird species richness. Understanding the structure of biotic communities in urban areas will allow us to propose management techniques and to decrease conflicts between wild species and human beings. The objective of this study was to describe the structure of the bird community in an urban ecosystem. The study was carried out in the city of Taubat, in southeastern Brazil. Point-counts were established in areas with different levels of tree density ranging from urban green spaces to predominantly built-up areas. We looked for a correlation between the richness/abundance of birds and the size of the area surveyed, the number of houses, the number of tree species and the number of individual trees. The results of multiple regression showed that bird richness had a direct relationship with vegetation complexity. The abundance and diversity of tree species were better predictors of bird species than the number of houses and size of the area surveyed. We discuss implications of this study for conservation and management of bird diversity in urban areas, such as the need to increase green areas containing a large diversity of native plant species

AB  - Despite being conspicuous and influential features of the biosphere, urban ecosystems have been neglected in ecological research. Arthropods are abundant in urban settings, but little is known about how these animals respond to urbanization. We systematically monitored the structure of ground arthropod communities for 12 months at 16 sites representing the four most abundant forms of urban land use (residential, industrial, agricultural, and desert remnant) in a rapidly growing metropolitan area (Phoenix, AZ). Although taxonomic richness was comparable among land-use types, community composition differed, with certain taxa being uniquely associated with each form of land use. Three taxa (springtails, ants, and mites) were extremely widespread and abundant, accounting for over 92% of captures; when these three taxa were excluded from analysis, however, differences were revealed in arthropod community composition with urban land use. Trophic dynamics also varied with land use: predators, herbivores, and detritivores were most abundant in agricultural sites, while onmivores were equally abundant in all forms of land use. These community-level differences resulted from taxon-specific responses to habitat structure, which varied with land use. Because arthropod community structure is affected by habitat structure and land use, and because arthropods play key roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollination, and soil aeration, the spatial heterogeneity of urban ecosystems therefore may affect ecosystem functioning. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Based on geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) techniques, the landscape classes of urban land use in Shanghai City were extracted from SPOT images with 5 m spatial resolution in 2002, and then, the classified data were applied to quantitatively explore the change patterns of several basic landscape metrics at different scales. The results indicated that landscape metrics were sensitive to grain- and extent variance. Urban landscape pattern was spatially dependent. In other words, different landscape metrics showed different responses to scale. The resolution of 40 m was an intrinsic observing scale for urban landscape in Shanghai City since landscape metrics showed random characteristics while the grain was less than 40 m. The extent of 24 km was a symbol scale in a series of extents, which was consistent with the boundary between urban built-up area and suburban area in Shanghai City. As a result, the extent of 12 km away from urban center would be an intrinsic handle scale for urban landscape in Shanghai City. However, due to the complexity of urban structure and asymmetry of urban spatial expansion, the intrinsic handle scale was not regular extent, and the square with size of 24 km was just an approximate intrinsic extent for Shanghai City.

AB  - Population growth and redistribution generate urban development in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties throughout the USA. This paper presents an analysis of population growth and urban development within a non-metropolitan county in southeastern New York State. Land use data for a 30 km by 50 km study area were integrated with ancillary physiographic data in a raster geographic information system. Spatial analysis of these data revealed that urban land uses increased from 6.7% of the landscape in 1968 to 17.8% in 1985, resulting in an expansion in urban land area that was eight times faster than the increase in population. The number of urban patches, or contiguous urban areas, decreased from 936 to 829, although the average size of the urban patches increased from 9.4 to 25.4 ha. The majority of the new urban land was residential development located between 3 and 25 km from the central business districts of the villages and cities within the landscape. Spatially dispersed urban development generates incremental landscape changes that typically contribute to environmental degradation. Land use policies designed to protect environmental quality in urbanizing landscapes should focus, therefore, on accomplishing at least three objectives: (1) minimize further fragmentation of the ecological infrastructure; (2) restore, where practical, severed linkages in the ecological infrastructure; and (3) guide new development to locations near existing urban centers. If any of these objectives are to be met in the adversarial legal and political milieu of the USA, policy makers must devise land use controls that do not constitute a 'taking' of private property. This paper argues that effective rural land use controls will not be widely implemented, or successfully withstand legal challenges, until empirical research demonstrates that land use spatial patterns directly affect both environmental quality and human quality of life, and that unregulated land markets in urbanizing landscapes encourage land use changes that inevitably degrade environmental quality.

AB  - Ur spatial structure & class relationships within Ur environments of dependent capitalist social formations contrast strongly with those evidenced in advanced capitalist industrialized nations. A theoretical understanding is proposed of capital accumulation that characterizes core & periphery in the world system. The concepts of "articulated" & "disarticulated" accumulation are used to analyze these alternative processes & to link class formation & class struggle to their objective expressions in the structure of Ur space. The analysis of Ur structure in peripheral social formations must begin with a theory of dependency. The issues over which classes struggle & their capacities to engage in struggle are determined by the constraints on the process of accumulation at a world system level & their differential focus in the international DofL. These processes are themselves mediated by the state & the forms of state intervention. The structurally distinct process of "disarticulated" accumulation in the periphery is used as the basis for a consideration of Ur structure within dependent capitalist nations.

AB  - According to the regulations and policies in Hubei Province, the potential of the ecological land in Wuhan City was analyzed with GIS, based on the land use map and the basic farmland protection map of 2006 in scale 1:10 000. The results showed that the area of ecological land could be 51 028.75 similar to 113 537.77 hm super(2). If all these ecological land were used for forestry, the greening ratio of the city could increase 6.01% similar to 13.37%. If only the banks of streams and rivers, the roadside and the slope farmland were all converted into the forest land, the forest coverage would increase by 1.91% similar to 9.27%. And when only those unused land were made good use, this percentage would be 4.1% more than present. So it is concluded that the unused land should first be planted with trees, and it is also necessary to appropriately add the amount of the conversion from the other land to the forest land.

AB  - The aims of this paper are to empirically test and evaluate methods for describing intraurban polycentricity, and to evaluate the polycentric development with respect to the regional development plan of the Office of Urban and Regional Transportation in 2001. The study area is Stockholm County and the time period investigated is 1991-2004. Three dimensions of polycentricity are analyzed: urban nuclei size relations, spatial distribution of urban nuclei, and potential interaction (accessibility). According to the methods' various qualifications in describing polycentric forms it is proposed here that a combination of methods is preferable for this subject. The polycentric structure exposes an increasing and considerable concentration of urban resources to the major urban nuclei. This concentration is combined with an increased spatial dispersal of the urban nuclei. In relative terms, the accessibility has decreased concerning the accessibility by public transportation modes and increased (workspace) or remained on almost the same level (residential space) by car transportation mode. Thus, the urban structural change in the Stockholm region corresponds to the political guidelines. In spite of this, by the increase in relative accessibility by car and decrease in the relative accessibility by public transportation modes the goal concerning higher share in public transports may not be possible to fulfill.

AB  - Cities are shaped by numerous decisions, yet urban spatial structure and locational decision-making are seldom linked. A principal components typology of land use change isolates four major processes of change: suburbanization, core area renewal, infrastructure growth, and specialized nucleations. These components identify the key decisions and decision agents involved. Comparative analyses of land use change and of site selection by individual developers in Toronto suggest a three-level hierarchy of locational determinants relating to the choice of site, to both site and context, and to factors apparent only at an aggregate level.

AB  - Conventional thinking in urban remote sensing is to synchronize the dates of when satellite imagery is captured with the date a social survey, such as a population census, is collected. It's assumed that identical dates, or dates as similar as possible, are intuitively important in order to make sure that structure, the physical configuration of a city as captured by remote sensing, relates as closely as possible to function, the socio-economic characteristics of a city, as represented by population censuses. However, this type of intuitive thinking is surely flawed because the structure of a city is hardly ever in harmony with the functionality of a city, at the same time. It is much more realistic to assume that there is a temporal lag between the socio-economic demands from a city's population and the consequential physical ramifications of such demands. In other words, the tangible layout of a city, i.e. roads, houses, etc, is a result of prior decisions made by planners with respect to demands from the city's population. This paper explores this temporal lag between structure and function by comparing the physical structure of cities from satellite images at T+1 with the functionality of the socio-economic characteristics from a population census in T-1. Initial results suggest an improved ldquoagreementrdquo between satellite images taken after a population census, in terms of predicting population growth and predicting residential demands. Further testing is needed in order to establish a theoretical link that can be used by planners in deciding where to develop cities, how sustainable such increased development can be contained and how best to reduce overcrowding, congestion and overall social deprivation.

AB  - Most studies of the economic activity of ethnic and immigrant groups have been conducted with little regard to their spatial conditions and consequences. At the same time, geo- graphic concentration or clustering of residences and businesses is often cited as a significant element in the formation of ethnic economies. This paper argues that spatial location may operate as a defined resource in enhancing the prospects of ethnic businesses. Specifically, it examines how the geographical concentration of residences or the clustering of businesses may operate to incubate beginning businesses, foster linkages between businesses, increase the opportunities for the establishment of additional businesses, and serve as an economic and cultural focus for the ethnic community. The paper then speculates on how the spatial patterns generated by ethnic eco- nomic activity will vary depending on the type of resources utilized, the sectoral composition of the ethnic economy, and the maturity of the economy.

AB  - Cities are the “engines of growth” because entrepreneurial and cre- ative activities are concentrated in cities. This suggests that cities grow by host- ing new businesses and “churning” industries advantageously. In so doing, cities need to adapt their spatial structure to mitigate negative externalities. Our previous paper (Lee and Gordon 2007) found that the links between urban structure and growth vary across metro size: more clustering in small metros and more dispersion in large metros were associated with faster employment growth. In this paper, we extend our research to investigate to what extent ur- ban spatial structure variables – dispersion and polycentricity – influence net new business formation (NNBF) and industrial “churning” in a cross-section of 79 U.S. metropolitan areas in the 2000s. The results of least squares regression and locally weighted regression analyses are mixed. OLS results for recent years fail to replicate our results for the 1990s. But applying a more powerful LOESS approach does give results for spatial impacts on NNBF and industrial churning that are consistent with the links between spatial structure and urban growth found in the earlier paper.

AB  - Examines methods of forecasting urban spatial structure from information on energy supply and cost. Five general forecasting approaches are identified, of which four are represented in the literature. Each forecasting approach incorporates a particular set of methods, techniques, and epistemological principles. Empiricists conclude that a causal link between energy and urban structure has not been demonstrated. In contrast, researchers employing scenario construction and various modeling techniques generally accept a causal link between energy and urban structure, but disagree on the nature of future urban geographies.-Author

AB  - Well-functioning urban land and housing markets are critical success factors for achieving robust economic growth. This paper provides an overview of urban land and housing market performance in Punjab Province of Pakistan. It describes the characteristics of well-functioning markets and argues that the Punjab's present markets are not performing adequately. In fact, there exists a range of impediments to efficient urban land and housing market performance: excessive public land ownership, inadequate infrastructure services, weak property rights, pervasive public- and private-sector rent seeking, counter-productive urban planning policies and regulations, costly sub-division and construction regulations, limited financing for property development and acquisition, rent controls and inadequate property-tax-based revenue-generating mechanisms. The paper concludes by suggesting that a prioritised comprehensive reform agenda is needed to improve urban land and housing market performance in Punjab Province. The analytical and conceptual approach used to research this paper is based on standard neo-classical economics. Therefore, the paper does not address broader political economy or structural issues. Consequently, the paper's contribution should be viewed as limited in scope.

AB  - Urban areas have developed under anthropogenic impact and hence feature strongly altered environmental conditions that influence today’s plant species distribu- tion. Generally, urban areas are rich in plant species, but on smaller scales richness can vary considerably. Our study aim is to identify areas of high species richness and to assess richness distribution patterns in the city of Hamburg by analyzing a floristic mapping dataset on the scale of 1 km2. Differences in plant species richness were analyzed between three urbanization zones. With multiple regression analyses, we tested effects of urban structure, habitat, and environmental conditions on the distri- bution of species richness measures. Total species richness per 1 km2 was 274±60 on average and differed only slightly between the urbanization zones. It increased with habitat diversity and decreased with Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for nutrients (multiple R2=0.31). Proportion of non-native species increased with mean annual temperature and decreased with EIVs for moisture (multiple R2=0.72), while propor- tion of endangered species increased with EIVs for moisture and decreased with EIVs for nutrients (multiple R2=0.66). Proportion of thermophilic species (multiple R2=0.58) could be explained bymean annual temperature. The emerging patterns probably differ from those in other cities due to the central port harboring a particular flora. Besides the expected high proportions of non-native species, high proportions of endangered species were also found in this area. Our results contribute to identifying drivers of biodiversity in cities and can thus be used to develop measures for the conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Urban environmental stewardship activities are on the rise in cities throughout the Northeast. Groups participating in stewardship activities range in age, size, and geography and represent an increasingly complex and dynamic arrangement of civil society, government and business sectors. To better understand the structure, function and network of these community-based urban land managers, an assessment was conducted in 2004 by the research subcommittee of the Urban Ecology Collaborative. The goal of the assessment was to better understand the role of stewardship organizations engaged in urban ecology initiatives in selected major cities in the Northeastern U.S.: Boston, New Haven, New York City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. A total of 135 active organizations participated in this assessment. Findings include the discovery of a dynamic social network operating within cities, and a reserve of social capital and expertise that could be better utilized. Although often not the primary land owner, stewardship groups take an increasingly significant responsibility for a wide range of land use types including street and riparian corridors, vacant lots, public parks and gardens, green roofs, etc. Responsibilities include the delivery of public programs as well as daily maintenance and fundraising support. While most of the environmental stewardship organizations operate on staffs of zero or fewer than ten, with small cohorts of community volunteers, there is a significant difference in the total amount of program funding. Nearly all respondents agree that committed resources are scarce and insufficient with stewards relying upon and potentially competing for individual donations, local foundations, and municipal support. This makes it a challenge for the groups to grow beyond their current capacity and to develop long-term programs critical to resource management and education. It also fragments groups, making it difficult for planners and property owners to work in partnership with them. The organizational networks are self-contained and do not include business or even legal groups, which may point to a gap between stewardship and environmental justice organizations.

AB  - Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in understanding urban interactions. We use a ?big? data set for Singapore from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation.In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders. Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements. The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into different areas that separate the population?s activity space into smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3 years of data, we find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and communities are emerging largely in line with the city?s master plan.To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a quantitative approach to urban analysis, which explicitly identifies ongoing urban transformations.\nUrban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

AB  - A shift from monocentric cities to increasingly polycentric urban regions has been widely recognised in recent research literature. Although polycentricity in general refers to the existence of several adjacent centres within the same area, many studies have emphasised that functional linkages between the centres of an urban system are also an essential part of polycentricity. Despite the increasing number of studies concerning functional polycentricity, research on the subject is still in a development phase. In this paper, a new approach to measure functional polycentricity is presented, in which functional polycentricity is approached through the connectivity of individual centres to the whole urban system. The paper illustrates the potential of the method with empirical case studies addressing the urban spatial structures of three functional urban regions in Finland. In the case studies, detailed commuting data are used in order to measure the degree of functional polycentricity.

A theoretical analysis demonstrates how recent fiscal and governance reforms give rise to land conversion decisions and long run urban spatial sizes that respond to economic incentives even though the allocation of land between urban and rural uses is determined administratively. An econometric investigation of China's coastal provinces finds that changes in urban area are increasing in the value of urban land and budgetary government revenues and decreasing in the value of agricultural land, results consistent with the theoretical analysis. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Urban traffic structure is the core issue of urban transportation industry. Reasonable urban traffic structure can meet urban residential transit demand, and also reduce greenhouse-gas emission of vehicles so as to decrease negative environment impact. Based on the principles of low-carbon economy, a quantitative model for environmental impact of urban traffic structure is established in this paper, which includes two sub-models. The first sub-model is urban traffic structure optimization model, which considers transport efficiency as target variable and various traffic factors as constraint variables. MOBILE software can be used to calculate carbon emission factors of different vehicles. The second sub-model is to calculate carbon emission gross of vehicles and analyze influence of different changing factors by using COMMUTER software. The quantitative model and corresponding analysis results will offer valuable suggestions for urban transport planning and environment protection.

AB  - A model of urban spatial structure for a linear and closed monocentric city is formulated by allowing the presence of randomly distributed idiosyncratic tastes for location in an otherwise uniform household population. Land use equilibrium conditions are shown to have a stochastic representation which depends on the distribution of the idiosyncratic tastes over the population of households. A special case in which the multinomial logit model gives the representative household's locational choice probability is derived and examined for a logarithmic utility function. It is shown that the stochastic equilibrium can also be obtained as the solution of a welfare optimum problem, either by maximizing total social welfare (primal) or by minimizing total opportunity cost (dual). Either formulation gives the equilibrium allocations and associated decentralizing land prices. Some comparative statics analysis is undertaken to show that while most results are like those of the Alonso-Mills-Muth model, increasing taste heterogeneity decentralizes the linear urban form, “flattening” the rent and population density gradients. The Alonso-Mills-Muth solution is obtained as an asymptotically limiting case which provides an upper bound on the “steepness” of the rent and population density gradients and a lower bound on the length of the linear city and the welfare level of the representative consumer.

With a new, place-based approach the various interpretations of inhabitant friendly, health promotive urban environments a) can be studied in close connection to the actual physical characteristics of the locations and b) the research findings can be transferred to the practitioners in visually informative form. The SoftGIS methodology developed in Aalto University enables the combination of ‘soft’ subjective data with ‘hard’, objective GIS-data. With the help of internet-based queries large empirical data can be gathered among various user groups, both children and adults. The softGIS data collected from the Helsinki metropolitan area and in the city of Turku among both adults (n=3100) and children (n=2800) reveal interesting associations between urban density, the proportion of green structure, the perceived quality of the environment, active living and the wellbeing and happiness of inhabitants.

AB  - This article reviews the literature on urban land value formation and spatial housing market dynamics in a cross-disciplinary spirit. By doing so, an analytical device is elaborated based on the most relevant interpretative communities (i.e. schools, streams of thought) of urban (economic) research. The point of departure is general economic theory, and the goal is innovative and middle-range approaches. The key concepts stem from three different modes of analysis: the neoclassical; the neo-Marxist; and the institutionalist (and related theories). The idea is to combine the relevant ideas of each interpretative community into one model, which subsequently may be applied for further analysis of topics related to urban land value, such as property prices, housing submarkets, locational preferences and the physical and social quality of the neighbourhood as a synthesized theoretical framework.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure. Improvements in ICT may lead to changes in urban structure, for example, because they reduce the costs of communicating ideas from a distance. Hence, they may weaken local agglomeration forces and thus provide incentives for economic activity to relocate to smaller urban centres. We use international data on city size distributions in different countries and on country-level characteristics to test the effect of ICT. We find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita encourage the spatial dispersion of population in that they lead to a more concentrated distribution of city sizes. So far the evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. We argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban structures once its use has spread more thoroughly through different economies.

AB  - Urban riparian habitats are potentially important resources for native birds in arid ecosystems. Most studies have assessed the value of urban riparian habitat in terms of vegetation and natural resources; however, the surrounding land use and infrastructure may determine the viability of urban habitat. We studied the impact of urban struc- ture, the combination of land use, infrastructure and vegetation variables that work together to shape the urban environment, on avian riparian habitat in the Truckee Meadows, Nevada, USA. Land use and infrastructure explained avian species richness and abundance better than local vegetation alone, but community resemblance was more strongly correlated to vegetation. Avian species guilds responded differentially to surrounding land use, suggesting there may be a functional difference between land use types. The best models for bird diversity used urban structure (both land use and vegetation) to describe potential habitat. Urban structure describes urban habitat in ways that vegetation variables alone cannot. Studies that ignore land use and infra- structure and other socioeconomic variables are likely missing key functional differ- ences within urban ecosystems, and may miss the potential for compatible development that encourages both biodiversity and urban growth.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of an income tax in a monocentric city where households equilibriate their allocation of time between work, commuting, and leisure. An increase in the income tax rate lowers the implicit value of time, and hence transportation costs. "Compensated equilibrium" comparative statics analysis shows that under certain conditions, this results in a larger, more dispersed urban area, with lower land rents at the city center and less population within any given distance from the center. The welfare effect of an income tax rate change is also studied, and an expression for the marginal excess burden is derived. The income tax produces welfare losses both because it induces substitution in favor of leisure and in favor of travel-the latter accompanied by excessive spatial dispersion and consumption of space. The marginal excess burden depends not only on the compensated demand elasticity for leisure, but also on that for space. Finally, the problem of benefit measurement for transportation projects in this tax-distorted spatial economy is examined. Benefit measures should be deflated to adjust for the fact that further transportation improvements lead to reduction of land use intensity, exacerbating the problem of spatial resource misallocation in an already excessively dispersed urban area. © 1985.

AB  - Population growth and redistribution generate urban development in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties throughout the USA. This paper presents an analysis of population growth and urban development within a non-metropolitan county in southeastern New York State. Land use data for a 30 km by 50 km study area were integrated with ancillary physiographic data in a raster geographic information system. Spatial analysis of these data revealed that urban land uses increased from 6.7% of the landscape in 1968 to 17.8% in 1985, resulting in an expansion in urban land area that was eight times faster than the increase in population. The number of urban patches, or contiguous urban areas, decreased from 936 to 829, although the average size of the urban patches increased from 9.4 to 25.4 ha. The majority of the new urban land was residential development located between 3 and 25 km from the central business districts of the villages and cities within the landscape. Spatially dispersed urban development generates incremental landscape changes that typically contribute to environmental degredation. Land use policies designed to protect environmental quality in urbanizing landscapes should focus, therefore, on accomplishing at least three objectives: (1) minimize further fragmentation of the ecological infrastructure; (2) restore, where practical, severed linkages in the ecological infrastructure; and (3) guide new development to locations near existing urban centers. If any of these objectives are to be met in the adversarial legal and political milieu of the USA, policy makers must devise land use controls that do not constitute a [`]taking' of private property. This paper argues that effective rural land use controls will not be widely implemented, or successfully withstand legal challenges, until empirical research demonstrates that land use spatial patterns directly affect both environmental quality and human quality of life, and that unregulated land markets in urbanizing landscapes encourage land use changes that inevitably degrade environmental quality.

AB  - The concept of 'automobile dependence', interpreted as a path-dependence phenomenon, informs this assessment of urban transport and structure trends in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area (KLMA). 'Automobile-dependent' cities, where high private vehicle use is strongly entrenched, are contrasted with 'traffic-saturated' cities, in which modest numbers of vehicles cause great problems for urban structures that are unsuited to them. Data from a recent international compilation are used to place the KLMA's patterns into perspective. The KLMA is found to be not yet very automobile dependent but a number of strong trends are encouraging and entrenching ever higher private motor vehicle use. Agencies in the KLMA are investing heavily in car-oriented mobility, while building urban designs that are hostile to non-car alternatives, yet with densities that may be incompatible with high car ownership and usage. These trends seem to run the risk of entrenching an intractable traffic crisis.

Both New Towns' growth and decline are related with the location benefits. Furthermore, through sensitivity analysis of key parameters on numerical simulation platform, the paper realizes the USS evolution and New Towns' development simulation from a bottom-up view. The results gotten through the modeling-simulation approach provide us with technical support to optimize the policy and institutional arrangements to achieve optimization management in the process of New Towns' development and urban planning.

AB  - This paper aims to demonstrate the relationship between economic growth and the urban core area in order to help urban planners reach a better understanding of the pressures that are leading to changes in land use. Using a unique panel dataset with measures of China's land use, it is shown that, during the late 1980s and 1990s, China's urban land area rose significantly. Descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis are then used to identify the determinants of urban land use change. In addition to using more standard regression approaches such as ordinary least squares, the analysis is augmented with spatial statistical analysis. The analysis demonstrates the overwhelming importance of economic growth in the determination of urban land use. Overall, it is found that urban land expands by 3 per cent when the economy, measured by gross domestic product, grows by 10 per cent. It is also shown that the expansion of the urban core is associated with changes in China's economic structure. If urban planners have access to forecasts of economic growth, using these results they should be able to have a better basis for planning the expansion of the built-up area in the urban core.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide a new mechanism for the spatial mismatch hypothesis. Spatial mismatch can here be the result of optimizing behavior on the part of the labor market participants. In particular, the unemployed can choose low amounts of search and long-term unemployment if they reside far away from jobs. They choose voluntary not to relocate close to jobs because the short-run gains (low land rent and large housing consumption) are big enough compared to the long-run gains of residing near jobs (higher probability of finding a job). ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In most metropolitan regions throughout the globe, urbanised land area is increasing to accommodate increasing population size. This article provides a simple yet powerful mathematical description of this urban expansion. Specifically, the following scaling relationship is proposed: land area (A) increases proportionally to population size (P) raised to a power (n)-- i.e. A {propto} P n. During 1950--2000, this relationship is found to hold well for US Census urban areas (UAs) with a greater than 10 per cent increase in population. Values for the parameter n vary among UAs, with a central tendency value of [~] 2, suggesting that, on average, newcomers to urban areas occupy about twice the land area per capita of existing residents. If n were exactly equal to 2, then the parameter group P/{surd}A (called `linear population density', or LPD) would be constant over time. LPD (units: people per metre) is the number of people in a metre-wide strip across an urban area. LPD is distinct from, and behaves somewhat differently than, population density. Distributions of LPD values among US UAs during 1950--2000 show surprisingly little variability over multidecade time-scales. For example, from 1950 to 2000, average population, land area and population density changed by more than a factor of 2, but average LPD changed less than 10 per cent. Few, if any, other attributes of urban form have remained so constant during this half-century time-period. International data corroborate the finding that LPD distributions are roughly constant over multidecadal time-scales. These results suggest an underlying pattern to how people arrange themselves within and among urban areas. For US UAs, rank--size rules similar to the generalised version of Zipf's rule hold for population, land area, LPD and population density. LPD is an important predictor of the emissions-to-inhalation relationship for motor vehicle emissions. Results presented here are important for theoretical, practical and empirical investigations of urban form and of how urban areas expand over time.

AB  - Recognition of the existence of nonlinear land prices has an impact on the measurement of the rate at which land price declines with distance from the urban center. It is hypothesized that concave parcel prices have given rise to overly large estimates of the rate of price decline with distance, because parcel sizes increase with distance and increased parcel sizes would be associated with lower unit prices as a result of the concavity of the land price function. This hypothesis is empirically tested using vacant residential, commercial, and industrial land sales from within Cook County, Illinois. An important finding is that allowing for concavity greatly reduces, although it does not eliminate, measured rates of price decline with distance.

AB  - This paper examines the characteristics of urban spatial development in Beijing and identifies the extent to which these characteristics can be attributed to the emerging land market in Beijing as well as the impact of land policy reform. Based on the observations of land use rights granted from 1993 to the first half of 2000 in the built-up area of Beijing, empirical analyses illustrate that both land prices and land development density decrease with distance to the city core. It further provides evidence that the slope of the land rent curve also depends on land use types. This leads to the conclusion that the land market influences land development decisions and urban form. Finally, it shows that the slope of the land rent curve and the elasticity of land-capital substitution change over time. The former declines, as expected. This is because Beijing's massive investments in transport have reduced transport costs, which in turn has shifted the land rent curve. The latter rises, implying the price effect on land development density. Both changes-in land rent function and the elasticity of land-capital substitution point to the maturing of the Beijing land market. It should be mentioned that there are enormous land developments outside the land market ( land development on administratively allocated land). These developments can significantly distort urban land use patterns portrayed through this study.

(2) The method of operationalizing "black pop increase" is open to question. (3) The conclusion that ghettoization is a relatively minor factor in black assimilation may be misleading. (4) The general term "assimilation" should not be used; rather the focus should be on degrees of equality or dissimilar ity in specific areas: educ, occup, income, & housing. (5) The measures should be combined with a recognition that the expectations people bring to an objective situation are important to their satisfaction or frustration & to subsequent action. R. M.

Marshall (Purdue U, Lafayette, Ind & U of Wisconsin, Green Bay), REPLY TO HARTLEY, welcome the points raised as illustrating the "always thorny problems involved in any causal analysis--ordering of variables & possible reciprocal influences."

AB  - This paper presents an intra-metropolitan approach to analyse the impact of urban spatial structure on local economic growth. Focusing on the Barcelona metropolitan region (BMR) between 1986 and 2001, we estimate a municipal employment growth model in which dynamic agglomeration economies related to urban spatial structure are considered using distance to employment centres, to assess metropolitan effects, and distance-weighted variables, to measure neighbourhood effects. The results obtained show the existence of neighbourhood specialization economies and metropolitan urbanization-localization economies fostering local growth. All of this leads to the paper’s main conclusion: urban spatial structure is important for economic growth in an intra-metropolitan context.

AB  - In the processes of spatial transformation subject to the laws of capitalism, the rural field was displaced by the demographic concentration and centralization of productive activities in cities. In the growth of urban structure these register the decisive practices of the social agents (factions of capital, the state, including all its levels, and labor) - whose actions create the city and define its identity. The above assertions are illustrated by an historical analysis of the social production of space in Mazatlan, a city that could have been just like any other in the industrialized world, but that today presents the characteristics of a Third World place as a result of the weak development of its productive forces, but especially of the way state intervention brought resources to the area only to have them exploited by elements of private capital, including foreign extractive sources. © SAGE Publications 2011.

It has office, business and residential functions. Both the Buda and the Pest sides have large outer residential belts both of villa and housing estate types, and belts of mixed functions. Finally the recent problems of the large housing developments sited on the outskirts of the town are introduced. Some of them are the neglect of the inner residential areas, the functions and centres in the large satellite housing estates, transportation problems.

AB  - Location-based assessments of accessibility gauge the attraction of a place relative to other places. These approaches have been used extensively in models of commuting and urban structure. Even though locational accessibility measures are integral to such efforts, they may also be used to explore aspects of urban spatial structure. As such, this paper presents a GIS-based analysis of locational accessibility for a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas. Indices of accessibility based on spatial interaction models are developed for intraurban residential and employment locations. Results show that residential accessibility patterns are similar across cities, taking a concentric pattern where the central urban area is most attractive. However, employment accessibility varies more from city to city; moreover, the areas of highest employment accessibility tend to be decentralized within their respective regions. Overall, location-based accessibility indices are useful for exploring urban form, particularly with respect to issues of urban sprawl. Directions for future research are identified, including linking comparative urban accessibility measures to ongoing work on commuting, the jobs-housing balance, and urban structure.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure. Improvements in ICT may lead to changes in urban structure, for example, because they reduce the costs of communicating ideas from a distance. Hence, they may weaken local agglomeration forces and thus provide incentives for economic activity to relocate to smaller urban centres. We use international data on city size distributions in different countries and on country-level characteristics to test the effect of ICT. We find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita encourage the spatial dispersion of population in that they lead to a more concentrated distribution of city sizes. So far the evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. We argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban structures once its use has spread more thoroughly through different economies.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Full article: UK, 18th March 2013 - As part of the response to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) the UK government has announced it will not commit to long-term financial support for the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) beyond 2013-14. This team plays a vital role in preventing wildlife crime here in the UK, and is also a contributor in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.  Commenting, Heather Sohl, species expert for WWF-UK said: "This is highly disappointing news, especially after the UK has fought hard towards an end to international wildlife trafficking at the CITES meeting over the last two weeks.[1] When the world is recognising illegal wildlife trade as a serious crime and looking for government commitments to end the trade, the UK should be stepping up its efforts to address these crimes within our own borders. The recommendations of the Committee are reasonable and would have achieved this, but the government is avoiding a long-term commitment to tackling wildlife crime."  The Government also rejected recommendations to tighten up the recording of wildlife crime data to help keep track and tackle trends in wildlife crime. Stephanie Pendry, Enforcement Programme Leader at TRAFFIC, who has worked as part of the unit, said: "I have witnessed first-hand the vital role that this unit plays. In the case of illegal wildlife trade, culprits are often part of wider criminal networks that operate across borders, and cracking down on such trade takes time and joint effort. It is precisely this time that the Unit have not been afforded by the Government, which is a real shame and will have a knock-on effect on operations to protect wildlife."  WWF and TRAFFIC gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) early last year and this was reflected in the October 2012 report on wildlife crime in the UK. It suggested that enforcement of wildlife crime in the UK is suffering due to the short term availability of funds, a lack of proper training and guidance over prosecutions, and unnecessarily complex legislation.[2]  UK prosecutors and judiciary must be aware of the serious nature of these crimes and how to handle them appropriately. Available penalties are not applied rigorously enough to reflect the nature of illegal wildlife trade crimes, so fail to act as a strong deterrent for future offences. Specialist wildlife crime training for generalist prosecutors and sentencing guidelines for the judiciary are needed.  The creation of specific wildlife crime codes have been rejected by the Home Office, but without the ability to record wildlife crime levels it is impossible to show the impact of such crime, and what trends are occurring, both over time and regionally. It is hard to justify more resources when it is not possible to demonstrate the true size and trends of the problem. If codes are not the answer, WWF and TRAFFIC urge the government to demonstrate an appropriate, alternative way to capture the information on crimes so desperately needed using existing systems.  Many of the EAC recommendations are also reflected in their inquiry from 2004. WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the Government to reconsider how it can take appropriate actions to address wildlife crime.  Notes to editors: [1] CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP) took place in Bangkok, Thailand between 3 and 14 March 2013. www.cites.org  [2] The Environmental Audit Committee conducted an inquiry into Wildlife Crime in the summer of 2012 and published its report in October. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/140/14 002.htm  [3] In February 2-13 the government announced one further year of funding for the unit until April 2014 - at the same level of funding as 2012-13 - but it did not comment on its intentions to make a long-term arrangement for funding the Unit, as recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee.

AB  - This paper proposes a varying coefficient model (VCM) to introduce city- and tract-specific variables into the exponential density functions used to study urban spatial structure. Since the selected city- and tract-specific characteristics may be subject to control by policy action and themselves comparatively easily projected on the basis of time, the VCM model can be used for both forecasting and policy analysis even though estimated from cross-sectional data. The results show that questions about the appropriateness of the exponential functional form and specification errors associated with the omission of city- and tract-specific variables can be handled by the VCM model. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of the VCM model as a tool for policy analysis and projection.

AB  - Due to continuous world-wide urbanization, especially in developing and emerging countries, urban environment represents one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth. The role of human settlements is becoming more and more important in land management, and the various structures of urban areas differ tremendously depending on social and historical backgrounds. So, beyond land-use and land-cover information, it is the urban composition that explains for social disparities, vulnerability to natural hazards, and deficits in urban and regional planning. In this study, first steps are presented towards and urban structural analysis using a multi-sensoral approach. With very high spatial resolution imageries, remote sensing offers techniques well-applicable to measure and monitor intra-urban heterogeneties. Imageries from Quickbird sensor and TerraSAR-X device, Spotlight mode, are taken to delineate field-mapped and well-defined urban structure types (UST). A robust rule base will be built which allows for accurate classifications and interpretation of typical-man-made structures. The most typical structural characteristics of urban regions are alignment and type of buildings, open and green spaces, and transportation network.

AB  - Most economic activity occurs in cities. This creates a tension between local increasing returns, implied by the existence of cities, and aggregate constant returns, implied by balanced growth. To address this tension, we develop a general equilibrium theory of economic growth in an urban environment. In our theory, variation in the urban structure through the growth, birth, and death of cities is the margin that eliminates local increasing returns to yield constant returns to scale in the aggregate. We show that, consistent with the data, the theory produces a city size distribution that is well approximated by Zipf's law, but that also displays the observed systematic underrepresentation of both very small and very large cities. Using our model, we show that the dispersion of city sizes is consistent with the dispersion of productivity shocks found in the data. CR  - Copyright &#169; 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Ltd.

AB  - Commuting patterns can be recognized by examining urban spatial structure. The latter can also be identified through the investigation of the former. This paper examines how well commuting patterns reflect the corresponding urban spatial structure. For this purpose, locational variables for commuting trip origin and destination are derived and included in an adjusted gravity model. The sign and the magnitude of the coefficients of those variables are interpreted along with the associated urban spatial structure. For a more formal comparison, urban density functions are estimated. Commuting data from the Seoul Metropolitan Region in 1987, 1990, and 1995 are used for an empirical analysis. The result shows that the distribution of employment is consistent between the spatial structure projected from the commuting patterns and the urban density distribution, while the distribution of employed residents is not, suggesting that the latter case should be interpreted with more caution. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paradox in urban economics over the last thirty years is that agglomeration economies (and diseconomies) are the driving force behind explanations of geographical concentration of economic activity and population within cities, yet remain something of a black box. There have been, as we shall see, several diverse attempts to measure these economies, but their precise role remains elusive. External economies of scale (both for individual industries and for economic activity as a whole) help to explain why economic activity (and population) concentrate in cities, while population-related scale economies subject to distance decay (threshold and range in central place parlance) account for the concentration of higher order consumer services (e.g., specialist hospitals, professional sports and cultural facilities, “commuter” universities) in larger urban centers. On the other hand, spatial concentration is eventually limited by offsetting diseconomies, ranging from pecuniary diseconomies (e.g., high land rents and wages) to traffic congestion and density-related pollution. The tension between these counteracting forces explains how fast metropolitan areas grow. More interesting, they largely account for the changes in metropolitan spatial structure over time. Why? Because, historically, both the agglomeration economies and congestion costs are generated within the central core, and as the economies begin to be overwhelmed by the congestion effects, firms (and households) can escape the consequences by relocating to decentralized locations.

AB  - Dynamics of urban environments are a challenge to a sustainable development. Urban areas promise wealth, realization of individual dreams and power. Hence, many cities are characterized by a population growth as well as physical development. Traditional, visual mapping and updating of urban structure information of cities is a very laborious and cost-intensive task, especially for large urban areas. For this purpose, we developed a workflow for the extraction of the relevant information by means of object-based image classification. In this manner, multisensoral remote sensing data has been analyzed in terms of very high resolution optical satellite imagery together with height information by a digital surface model to retrieve a detailed 3D city model with the relevant land-use land-cover information. This information has been aggregated on the level of the building block to describe the urban structure by physical indicators. A comparison between the indicators derived by the classification and a reference classification has been accomplished to show the correlation between the individual indicators and a reference classification of urban structure types. The indicators have been used to apply a cluster analysis to group the individual blocks into similar clusters.

AB  - The challenge of facilitating economic density is fundamental for successful urbanization. Flexible and forward-looking institutions that help the efficient functioning of land markets are vital in this respect. In particular, institutional arrangements for regulating land use, managing public land and allocating land rights have significant implications for how cities deliver agglomeration economies and improve the welfare of their residents. This book provides fresh insights into these issues, compiling selected pieces of analytical and empirical research presented at the World Bank's Fourth Urban Research Symposium on Urban Land Use and Land Markets, held in Washington, DC, May 2007. Specially commissioned papers helped develop a robust analytical foundation to clarify ongoing debates on urban land management and welfare and synthesized the political and administrative challenges of improving the efficiency of urban land markets. Among the questions that this book addresses are: - Does more public intervention in land markets produce more affordable land market outcomes? - Do conventional approaches to strengthening property rights bolster security of tenure and market transactions? - How should governments go about integrating informal settlements with the broader city economy? © World Bank 2009.

The urban land leasing price–distance relationship is estimated based on the argument that monocentric urban structure is representative for Chinese cities. Both population size and income level are found to positively affect urban land price and price–distance gradients. Commercial land prices are higher than residential land prices except in suburbs or outer central urban areas, where the land prices of different uses converge. In most situations, commercial use price gradients are larger than those of residential use.

AB  - The influence of the scale and diversity of municipal government and of community-wide voluntary associations on the formation of hospital councils was examined in 130 of the largest cities in the United States. These two variables, together with other organizational variables that describe communities accounted for the main part of the explained variance in the formation of hospital councils. They also accounted (1) for the relationship observed here and in other studies between how a community organizes itself for health and how it organizes itself in other spheres, notably with respect to antipoverty programs and (2) for the marketlike conditions under which the need for new interorganizational relations (here for hospital councils) is transformed into demand that brings about their formation. The second finding suggests that the degree of relationship between demand and supply depends upon organizationally induced variations in the marketplace. Both findings indicate that the integrative significance of government and voluntary associations may rest less upon linking individuals to their environment than upon linking organizations to one another, thereby supporting the feasibility of an interorganizational level of analysis.

AB  - The paper explores a framework combining remote sensing and spatial metrics aimed at improving the analysis and modeling of urban growth and land use change. While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales.

AB  - In this paper, we study the time-optimal trajectory planning of a sensor attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide complete 3-dimensional coverage with applications to urban environments with 2.5-dimensional features. The basic approach is to approximate the features of interest with a set of non planar coverage surfaces and to design a motion plan that guarantees the coverage surface is swept completely with a conical-field-of-view sensor. We establish a lower bound on time for a UAV to achieve complete coverage and derive the analytical coverage plan whose duration is a constant times this lower bound. Our hardware-in-the-loop simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of information technology on urban spatial structure in the Chicago region. Urban scientists are challenged to understand in what ways information technology has influenced the distribution of urban economic activities: concentration or dispersion. Using data collected in the Chicago region, orientation of establishments toward the center is tested to separate the impact of locational features of centers from the impact of information technology. The result reveals that information technology has attraction as well as spillover effect on urban spatial structure and thus concentration rather than dispersion is dominant at a local scale in the Chicago region. It was found, however, that center-orientedness varies depending on the sector.

AB  - Trees benefit urban communities environmentally, esthetically and recreationally. This raises the question of whether Denmark's towns have enough space for more trees. A research project investigated this by examining in detail the potential for more sustainable planning and management of urban green space in towns with 10,000-40,000 inhabitants and was completed in 1999. The paper describes the vegetation cover in selected urban areas, including the cover of woody vegetation (trees and shrubs) and discusses the land area potentially available for supplementary planting in urban zones. The method used to map urban vegetation is discussed and related to Denmark's administrative practice and planning system. Case studies are presented for various categories of urban land use to highlight the variation in vegetation cover and to identify the land area available for increasing tree cover. Apart from undeveloped urban land, the largest areas potentially available for planting included industrial zones, institutional zones and apartment complexes. Other types of residential district lacked the coherent space normally required for sustainable planting. The cover of trees and shrubs in the case study towns is very limited, but large areas of non-functional lawn could be available for planting. Lawn comprised the largest proportion of the urban surface cover in the case studies. The findings of the case studies were assembled into data sets relating to each type of urban zone and summed up in green structure maps based on geographical information systems. This approach can provide an overview of best practices to allow areas lacking vegetation cover to be identified. This assessment method can usefully be applied to incorporate issues related to the urban natural environment and urban greening potential into conventional planning practice in Denmark's municipalities. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This chapter presents the concept of decentralized spatial computing (DeSC) as a way to embed dynamic spatial data capture and processing capabilities within our built urban environment. The chapter illustrates the potential of DeSC for safeguarding privacy in a dynamic location-based services scenario: Mobile service users protect their potentially sensitive location by the use of a decentralized query algorithms, solely collaborating with peers close by and thereby excluding the privacy bottleneck of an omniscient global service provider. In an extensive set of consecutive experiments several decentralized query algorithms were tested, trading the level of privacy for the quality of service. The use of a real world test bed, - a small part of Ordnance Survey's OS MasterMap (R) Integrated Transport Network (TM) Layer for Southampton - underlines the experiments' validity. The chapter concludes with a research and development agenda for DeSC in the urban context.

AB  - Previous studies have found that the urban land value function became flatter during the 19th century, apparently due to declining transportation costs and increasing income. Estimates from these studies imply that housing demand became less elastic over the same period (from elastic to unit elastic). This paper demonstrates that the latter conclusion is rejected when the area of the city is defined correctly and consistent estimation procedures are used. By combining urban and non-urban data, previous studies underestimated the degree to which the slope of the land value function declined over time. When only urban data are used, the decline is even greater, and the price elasticity of demand for housing is uniformly unit elastic. In addition, the commonly used Box-Cox transformation is found to be an imprecise method of generalizing functional form and subject to substantial small-sample bias which, if ignored, leads to an underestimate of standard errors.

It includes a quantitative assessment of urban growth and changing patterns of population density in the city's administrative sub-districts. In a unique contribution to the available research on Cairo, the population density for the built-up area of the census units is calculated, giving much greater insight into the city's growth than previous research that calculated density based on census units in their entirety. The study finds significant population decentralisation taking place and discusses the possible implications if this trend continues.

AB  - According to the standard model of urban traffic congestion and urban spatial structure, congestion tolling results in a more concentrated city. In recent years, a new model of rush-hoururban auto congestion has been delveoped that incorporates trip-timing deicsions - the bottleneck model. In the simplest bottleneck model optimal congestion tolling without toll-revenue redistribution has no effect on trip price because the efficiency gains exactly equal the toll revenue collected. Optimal congestion tolling then has no effect on urban spatial structure. This paper formalizes and extends this result.

AB  - In conjunction with urbanization and its importance as a major driver of land-use change, increased efforts have been placed on understanding urban forests and the provisioning of ecosystem services. However, very little research has been conducted on private property and little is known about the structure and function of privately owned urban forests. This research examines the structure of and carbon storage services provided by private residential urban forests in a moderate-sized Midwestern city. The primary research questions are as follows: What is the structure of private urban forests, and how does it vary across parcels? How much carbon is stored in tree and soil pools of private urban forests, and how does carbon vary across parcels? Ecological inventories were conducted on 100 residential parcels within 14 Neighborhood and Homeowners Associations of varying size and development age. Tree species richness, diversity, density, and diameter distribution were determined on a per parcel basis and for the entire tree population sampled. Further, tree and soil carbon storage were determined for each parcel. Results of this research demonstrated large variability in per-parcel tree metrics. Twelve of the parcels sampled had two or fewer trees, while eleven had greater than 50 trees. Further, tree carbon storage ranged from no carbon to 11.22kgCm-2. Alternatively, soil carbon storage was less variable and averaged 4.7kgCm-2, approximately 1.9 times higher than the average carbon stored in trees (2.5kgCm-2). Management efforts aimed at maintaining or enhancing carbon storage and other ecosystem services should focus on both soil protection and maximizing services in living biomass. Our results demonstrate that sustaining tree-produced ecosystem services requires maintenance of large old trees and species diversity, not only in terms of relative abundance, but also relative dominance, and in combination, species-specific size distributions. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - With nearly half of the world’s population living in urban areas, the logic of growing more food in the city, close to the point of consumption, seems overwhelming. Many of the most effective inventions of an era actually are not entirely new when they break ground. More often than not, they are reapplications of existing technologies to a new or different problem. This process of adapting an extant technology to a different problem is at the heart of a new approach to sustainable food production. As ever more attention is directed at the environmental flaws in today’s agricultural industry, and as global climate change and its implications place additional constraints on available resources of land, water, and energy, the need for creative and adaptive methods of food production has become clear. This article proposes a new, effective, and pragmatic approach to urban agriculture. The two questions it seeks to address are how and where food is produced.

AB  - Little appears to be known about the value of urban green spaces (tree canopy cover and grassy areas) in a Mediterranean climate, or in relation to multifamily buildings. This study starts addressing this gap by quantifying the impact of urban green spaces on the value of 1197 multifamily buildings sold in 2003/04 in Los Angeles, California. To assess the robustness of the results, a spatial Durbin model is contrasted with a geographically weighted regression model and an extensive sensitivity analysis is conducted. It is found that increases in grassy areas either on the parcels of multifamily buildings or in their vicinity (200 metres outward from each parcel boundary) would typically not enhance their value and neither would more parcel tree canopy cover (TCC); by contrast, most multifamily properties would benefit from an increase in vicinity TCC. These results have implications for tree planting programmes that rely heavily on private property owners.

AB  - The urban forest provides valuable ecosystem services for enhancing human well-being. Its structure and composition determine the quantity and quality of these services. There has been little research on the heterogeneity in structure and composition of urban forests in the Australasian region, especially in the centre of a highly dynamic and rapidly urbanizing city. This paper quantifies the structure and the composition of the urban forest of Melbourne, Australia's city centre. The effects of land tenure and land use on the heterogeneity of canopy cover, tree density and canopy size were explored. Species and family composition by land use, land ownership and street type were also analysed using the Shannon–Wiener and Jaccard similarity indices. Most of the canopy cover in the city centre is located on public land and is unevenly distributed across the municipality. The mean canopy cover (12.3%) is similar to that found for whole city studies around the world, which often include peri-urban forests. Similarly to other cities, structure varied across different land uses, and tree size, density and cover varied with land tenure and street type. The diversity index shows that the urban forest is rich in species (H′=2.9) and is dominated by native species. Improving the distribution, and increasing tree cover and variety of species will result in a more resilient urban centre, able to provide multiple ecosystem services to their residents and its large population of visitors and workers. The study of the urban centre provides further understanding of compact city morphologies, and allows inter-city comparison independent of the size.

AB  - I investigate the effect of improvements to the transportation infrastructure on changes in location patterns of population in Barcelona, Spain between 1991 and 2006. At a census tract level, I verify and extend the finding of Baum-Snow (2007a) that transportation improvements cause suburbanization: (1) improvements to the highway and railroad systems foster population growth in suburban areas; (2) the transit system also affects the location of population inside the central business district (CBD). To estimate the causal relationship between the growth of population (density) and transportation improvements, I rely on an instrumental variables estimation that uses distances to the nearest Roman road, the nearest 19th century main road, and the nearest 19th century railroad network as instruments for the 1991-2001 changes in distance to the nearest highway ramp and the distance to the nearest railroad station. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Road traffic plays a crucial role in the shaping of urban spatial structure. The research on the relationship between them has always been a hot topic to economists, urban geographers and urban planning experts. Especially after the entering of 21st century, various problems have emerged with the rapid development of cities. Therefore, it has become a popular concern for both the government and academic circles about how to use road traffic efficiently to create an intensive urban space structure, thus solving the problems arising during the development of the city. The thesis reviews relevant research achievements about the intensive use of urban space based on road traffic systematically, as well as pointing out the prospect of future development in this field from the following aspects: the influences road traffic has on both urban exterior spatial pattern and urban interior spatial structure; the effects urban space has on road traffic and the urban space planning oriented to the road traffic.

AB  - This paper extends a recent von Thünen-type model of urban structure by Mills to include two competing forms of transportation, and then compares simulated representative American and European cities with respect to size, density, and land rents. Assuming consumers minimize costs in choosing between competing travel modes, the 19-equation model demonstrates that land rent differentials are diminished by adding an alternative travel mode, and that transport capacity is far more important than fare structures in determining transit patterns and land use. American urban structure appears to resemble European urban patterns as transportation modes proliferate.

AB  - In this paper we describe our novel use of space syntax for the design and development of pervasive systems. Pervasive systems are computer systems that are designed to be “invisible” to users because they are designed to blend in with their environment and become part of the fabric of everyday life. Pervasive systems consist of fixed, mobile and embedded components, each of which may entail interactive capabilities and intelligence. Due to their close relationship with the build environment, pervasive systems are an ideal domain for adopting a space syntax methodology. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we present an adaptation of the space syntax methodology aimed at researchers and designers of space and pervasive systems. By developing an adaptation of the space syntax methodology we intend for space syntax to be added the arsenal of tools and theo- ries that researchers use to understand and design pervasive systems. To exem- plify how this can be achieved, we present three case studies that demonstrate cru- cial ways in which space syntax analysis can aid the design of pervasive systems. The case studies presented here show how space syntax can be used in the devel- opment of pervasive system as an application development tool, as an exploratory tool, and as a modelling tool.

The methodology presented includes graphical measures of physical accessibility, a numerical index of accessibility that is consistent with graphical measures, residents' accessibility weighted by transport availability, and the relationship between accessibility and travel behaviour. Some empirical results are presented for access and travel to male and female jobs in Sydney, with the use of data collected for the 1971 Census of Population and for the Sydney Area Transportation Study. The consequences of some alternative arrangements of land use and plans to improve public transport on residents' accessibility are investigated. It is argued that accessibility measures are a useful aid to planners and policymakers in the social evaluation of urban structure.

With its economic development, population growth, and urbanization in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China, have experienced a dramatic land use change over the past 30 years. Assessment on urban land use change is essential for policy makers to support sustainable development. In this paper, urban land use change in Chengdu using Landsat TM/ETM+images (2000-2008) based on RS and GIS is discussed. The result shows that the spatiotemporal change of urban land use was significant, the conversion between cultivated land and built-up land was intensive, more and more agriculture land was converted to non-agriculture land, therefore, urban area expands was very fast. It is also noted that decrease area of cultivated land was 12.025&amp;#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> hm<sup>2</sup>, increase area of built-up land was 6.195&amp;#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> hm<sup>2</sup> over the past 8 years resulting in large scale urban land use.

Some issues were solved and others remain to be solved. If Tokyo is evaluated as one of the most efficient, productive and sustainable mega-regions in the world, it is the result of rapid urban growth and development in the twentieth century. After that, Tokyo has been facing new challenges as it left the phase of rapid growth and entered the phase of no- or low-growth, depopulating and aging society. In this respect, Tokyo is a leading or an instructive mega-region in the world. At the same time, Tokyo must take part in the global effort to achieve sustainability.

AB  - Studying urban population and spatial structure using aggregate census data suffers from problems of spatial aggregation and temporal comparability, particularly for the rapidly changing cities of China. The development in GIS has potential to represent population distribution in a continuous field with grid cells using surface model techniques, which is a more accurate representation of population distribution. This paper attempts to better model and analyze population distribution, using Nanjing, China as a case. With the aids of the detailed urban land use and building distribution data, I develop an alternative method to generate population surface, and uncover spatial variations of population distribution in Nanjing. I found that despite suburbanization, Nanjing remains a compact city, and population density declines quickly with the increase of the distance to the CBD. I also use exploratory spatial data analysis to investigate spatial associations between non-residential land uses and population density, and have found significant influence of commercial activities on population distribution. Industrial suburbanization, however, does not have significant effects on population suburbanization.

AB  - This paper seeks to extend the definition of a sub-centre beyond the usual definition as a place with significantly larger employment density that has an effect on the overall employment density of the nearby locations. Together with the previous conditions, it is suggested that it is necessary to include another which represents a structural element of an urban sub-system within the metropolitan configuration-that is, a place with intense spatial interaction with its hinterland. Therefore, a metropolitan area can be seen as one comprising urban sub-systems characterised by greater or lesser polycentrism. In this paper, a 'bottom-up' methodology based on commuter flows is proposed in order to detect metropolitan sub-centres. Using empirical data from the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, the proposed methodology is tested, comparing its results with those of other commonly used methodologies (cut-offs, parametric and non-parametric models). The results suggest that the proposed methodology permits optimising the sub-centre delimitation process.

The Housingrelated 'urban typology' provides a uniform methodological and spatial framework for the different tasks within the interdisciplinary network of the research project to aid the development of future climate change resilience- Building and thus resilience- Urban Structure. The case study is based on initial research experiences of the development of GIS-based vulnerability indicators in the application area of adaptation of a high-risk agglomeration area to the future impacts of Climate Change. Based on the extended Urban Structure Type (UST) approach(HAGGAG & AYAD 2002). The proposed model represents an interpretative method to respond and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

AB  - Traditionally, city classification studies have been considered descriptive. Empirical results have typically not been applied to explain or predict other urban characteristics. This pattern was reversed in the 1980s by the application of the results of two well-known classification studies as independent variables in a regression analysis. In performing statistical inference, it was implicitly assumed that the classifications provide measures of unobservable theoretical constructs. In this paper, it is argued that knowledge of a classification's validity is required prior to performing such inference. An example of a construct validation is provided by proposing that the physical and spatial characteristics of urban areas may in part be described by four independent dimensions and an attempt is made to operationalise and validate appropriate measures. -Author

These techniques had been applied to investigate the effects of urbanization on fertile lands and to quantify urban growth of Amman area. Five land covers were identified in space and time using aerial photographs, LANDSAT and IKONOS images acquired at different dates. The study showed that the urban area was increased by 162 km2 over the period 1918–2002, which represents 509 times the original urban area. The fertile lands decreased by 86 km2, which represents 23% of loss. Moreover, the urban expansion over 1918–2002 was analyzed and its impacts on the Amman area environment were assessed. The results of our study were compared to other similar studies for Istanbul and Bangkok. The comparison showed that Amman has the largest percent annual rate of urban expansion

Using gravity model, this paper makes a detailed analysis on variation track about urban land price and land spatial expansion of Shijiazhuang from aspects of location, moving direction, distance of land price gravity center and land space gravity center from 1999 to 2008. Based on the comparative analysis of the relationship between two series of gravity centers, we draw conclusions about function of urban land price on land spatial expansion. Results show that there is close relationship between land price gravity center and land space gravity center, with adjacent location, same direction of movement and related convergence rate. The function of urban land price on land spatial expansion is mainly reflected in regulating spatial arrangement of urban land and guiding direction of urban land expansion.

We use a version of the Alonso-Muth-Mills model, calibrated to broadly match some of the features of a representative large city. Although the calibrated model omits many real-world features, it can nonetheless be used to explore the impact of factors such as: (i) the provision of transport infrastructure; (ii) zoning policies that limit housing density; (iii) frictions on the production of housing; and (iv) population size. The empirical section of the article shows that the model is consistent with some empirical regularities for large Australian cities. The results of the article draw attention to structural factors that may have contributed to developments in the Australian housing market in recent years.

AB  - This paper analyzes the impacts of urban transportation system changes and income changes on the welfare of people and on the urban spatial structure, in a setting where the income level differs between two groups, and two transportation modes compete with each other in a city. It is demonstrated that an improvement in some transport facility will not necessarily increase the welfare level of every household, and, at times decreases the welfare of some households. It also is argued that under particular situations, an improvement in a particular transport mode may produce a contraction in the city size rather than an expansion. Similarly, an increase in income of one group might have an adverse effect on the welfare of another income group as a result of competition in the land market. © 1990.

AB  - Using data on 43 randomly selected census tracts for each of 39 U.S. cities in 1970, we present a comprehensive econometric analysis of a varying parameter density gradient (VCM) model in which the functional form, together with the variance components of an implied error structure, is freely estimated. We generalize a recent model of Johnson and Kau in which certain city- and tract-specific socioeconomic variables are introduced to depict the dynamic process of urban growth. Since these variables can be either controlled by policy actions or projected on the basis of time, we reexamine the usefulness of VCM framework for both forecasting and policy simulation purposes. © 1983.

In this article, we\nselected 22 indicators, which came from different respects including\neconomy, population, education, industry, government and environment, to\ncalculate the urban comprehensive development index (CDI) of 25 cities\nin Yangtze River Delta by employing the entropy weighting method. In\ncombination with spatial autocorrelation analysis, we found that: The\ncities in Northern Zhejiang developed more quickly than Southern\nJiangsu, and the development of urban agglomeration in Yangtze River\nDelta showed significant agglomeration characteristics in spatial\ndistribution. According to the results of entropy weighting, the\ngovernment, FDI, science and education, environment, and factors\nmobility were the important factors to influence the integration process\nof Yangtze River Delta. And the Integration of urban agglomeration was\nbased on the well-developed industrialization and urbanization of area,\nand its impetus came mainly from the aggregation and dispersion effect\nof central cities, industrial development and regional division of\nlabor, the government support, scientific and technological advancement\nas well as environmental improvement. Finally, we stimulated the\nevolution of spatial structure of urban agglomeration in Yangtze River\nDelta through C-means fuzzy clustering model and GIS technology.

AB  - Full article: Bangkok, Thailand, 16th May 2012—Thai police have seized the carcasses of two Tigers, a Leopard and a Golden Cat from a house in Khan Na Yao, in Bangkok today.  Officers from the Crime Suppression Division and the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police have arrested a Thai man and a Vietnamese man in connection with the crime. All three species are protected in Thailand, and are all listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The animals, found chopped up and stuffed into a freezer in the house, were believed to have been sourced from Malaysia and moved through Sadao, a district in the southern Thai province of Songkla, which shares a border with Malaysia.  Initial investigations have shown the animals were bound for China via Nong Khai, a town near the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.   From Nong Khai, the animals were to be transported across the Mekong River to Lao PDR before being moved to China.  Police said the suspects were paid 8,000 Baht (USD250) to transport the animals from the south of Thailand to Bangkok.  The seized animals have been handed over to the Wildlife First Aid Clinic where samples will be taken for DNA analysis.  “Any DNA analysis should be undertaken with an eye toward establishing the origins of these animals. Going forward, it will be important to know exactly where they came from.” noted TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director, Dr. William Schaedla.  “We also hope the Thai authorities will undertake a thorough investigation of the transport routes being utilized by the smugglers and co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighboring countries. Simply seizing dead animals will not be enough to prevent future losses of tigers and other endangered animals to wildlife trafficking.”  For further images of the haul, please contact Richard Thomas, +44 752 6646216, richard.thomas@traffic.org.

AB  - Fining useful generalizations about urban forest structures for a nation can assist in developing urban forest science and urban forestry planning and management. This process entails adopting commonly understood definitions of urban forest structure and urban boundaries. Urban forest structure is determined by three broad factors: urban morphology, which creates the spaces available for vegetation, natural factors, which influence the amount and types of biomass likely to be found within cities, and human management systems, which account for intraurban variations in biomass configurations according to land use distributions. Together these factors provide an explanation for urban forest structure and enhance our ability to predict structure from limited information.

AB  - A recent study in Frederikshavn, Denmark, shows that urban structural variables influence travel behaviour, even in a small town of around 30 000 inhabitants. As might be expected, socio-economic and attitudinal factors play a role in the respondents' travelling patterns. However, when controlling for these factors and a range of other potential explanatory variables, clear relationships are also found between urban structural characteristics and travel activity. These relationships exist across most subgroups of the population. The statistical relationships found between urban structure and travel behaviour are confirmed in qualitative interviews. The distance from the residence to the downtown area is a key factor influencing the accessibility to a number of facilities. These differences in accessibility result in corresponding differences in the actual travelling distances and modal split.

AB  - The aim of this study is to propose the application of landscape ecology in planning urban ecological networks to conserve nature in urban landscapes and to develop a sustainable use of urban lands. Compared to the classical planning approach based on socio-economic land suitability, the principles of landscape ecology are helpful simultaneously conserving the ecological processes of landscapes and their steady changes. This approach could help in defining sustainable landscape development, aiming for a balance between both physical and natural systems in urban areas. This research is focused on the ecological networks in Tehran’s metropolitan area as a case study to provide a model for network planning in other urban areas, where urbanization seriously threats the natural environment. In concluding this research, the spatial structure and function of the area are studied and categorized based on the patch-corridor-matrix model. The paper concludes with methods of intervention and suggestions for the structural and functional improvement of urban landscapes towards achieving a more sustainable form of land use planning.

AB  - The interactions between the structure of a city and the atmosphere have an impact on thermal comfort, air quality and building energy consumption for space heating and cooling. A mesoscale model, with a multilayer urban canopy parameterization, coupled with a simple building energy model is used to investigate such interactions by simulating 22 idealized cities in 3D with the same total population, but different population densities and vegetation fraction in the urban areas. Simulations are performed for summer and winter periods at mid latitude and for a hot dry climate. Results indicate that compact cities, with buildings with low surface-to-volume ratios, minimize the building energy consumption for space heating/cooling, but maximize the outdoor heat stress. For air quality, the optimum is for cities with intermediate population densities. The inclusion of vegetation is most of the time positive, and never detrimental, in this climate. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban structure influences directly or indirectly the majority of all green house gas (GHG) emissions in cities. The prevailing belief is that dense metropolitan areas produce less carbon emissions on a per capita basis than less dense surrounding rural areas. Consequently, density targets have a major role in low-carbon urban developments. However, based on the results of this study, the connection seems unclear or even nonexistent when comprehensive evaluation is made. In this letter, we propose a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) method for calculating the consumption-based carbon footprints in metropolitan areas, i.e. carbon consumption, with the emphasis on urban structures. The method is input–output-based hybrid LCA, which operates with the existing data from the region. The study is conducted by performing an analysis of the carbon consumption in two metropolitan areas in Finland, including 11 cities. Both areas consist of a dense city core and a less dense surrounding suburban area. The paper will illustrate that the influence of urban density on carbon emissions is insignificant in the selected metropolitan areas. In addition, the utilized consumption-based method links the climate effects of city-level development to the global production of emissions.

AB  - This study examined native bird communities in forest patches across a gradient  of urbanization. We used field data and multivariate statistical techniques to examine the  effects of landscape context, roads, traffic noise, and vegetation characteristics on bird  community composition in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A.). Landscape-level  variables, particularly those related to urbanization, were most important in structuring  forest bird communities. Specifically, we found that road density and amount of urban land  cover were the best predictors of species composition. We found that urban and rural bird  communities were quite distinct from each other. Rural communities had more long-  distance migrants and forest interior species but species richness did not differ between the  communities. Our results suggest some specific guidelines to target bird species of interest  both inside and outside of urban areas. For example, if increasing numbers of migratory  species is of primary concern, then conservation areas should be located outside of urban  boundaries or in areas with low road density. However, if maximizing species richness is  the focus, location of the conservation area may not be as important if the conservation area  is surrounded by at least 50 m of forest habitat in all directions.

Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding where and how residential location affects urban activity, yet little of this effort has been directed to work and what determines location choices in cities. This study addresses this question by providing a theory based on modern labor economics, which complements the residential location theory at the core of recent urban studies. It analyzes the importance of workplace location in assessing matters of spatial structure, commuting patterns, underemployment, and the formation of urban ghettoes. The book lucidly blends theoretical analysis with empirical evidence, especially that from transportation survey data.

AB  - Basic to several key issues in current urban economic theory and public policy is a presumption that local imbalances between employment and residential sites strongly influence people's commuting patterns. We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of job and housing locations. We find that the amount of commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across job locations only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting.

Both a control of the housing price at the urban fringe and a zoning policy that relaxes more-than-proportionately the floor area ratio in favor of locations toward the city center are growth-enhancing. The long-run rate of growth is unambiguously lower in a regime where zoning does not differentiate land-use intensity, compared to the conventional setup. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - AbstractUrban land-use planning is becoming increasingly complex in China because it requires estimating the future urban extent and balancing its various aspects, e.g., provision of enough housing and employment opportunities and preservation of the environment. This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system. In addition to these nonspatial goals, objectives concerning the spatial distrib...

For small numbers of stations, numerical methods maximising total passenger-km give the optimal spacings, and it is found that stations should indeed be significantly more dispersed in the suburbs. The fixed nature of station infrastructure, however, means that as urban density patterns evolve, the stations will progressively become located in the wrong positions, with associated efficiency losses. Numerical methods are also used to estimate the seriousness of these efficiency losses in the simplest cases. The findings on station spacing are compared with the urban-rail systems of London, Munich, Paris and Washington, DC.

AB  - This paper developed a method to assess the appropriateness of urban structure via evaluating the accessibility of public transportation. Through a validated accessibility index, it combined the physical setting of urban environments with the residents' satisfactions toward public transportation. Taking Beijing as an example, this paper first analyzed the influencing factors of the accessibility of public transportation from three perspectives including public service, local development status, transportation and road construction. Then, it built a hierarchical logistic regression model of satisfaction. It was found that the satisfaction of people varied spatially, with the marginal effect of within the 5th Ring Road being lower than that outside the 5th Ring Road. The connectivity to the main places of the city by public transportation, and the density of bus stops within a distance of 800 m were found to have significantly affected the satisfaction of people toward public transportation. In addition, people of different attributes valued differently. The results had implications for improving the transportation environment of Beijing. (1) At present, the investment of public transportation should focus on the areas in the built-up areas inside the 5th Ring Road rather than the suburban areas. (2) It is socially desirable that the 800-m-service areas of bus stops cover the whole city; and according to the function of various areas, the optimal density of bus stops should be different. (3) The connectivity to the main function nodes of the city by public transportation should top the agenda on the planning of bus lines, as it can substantially improve the efficiency of public transportation system and the satisfaction of the people. (4) The spatial distribution of the people with different attributes such as age and income should be taken into account when local public transportation policies are made.

AB  - Urban growth patterns are characteristic of spatial changes that take place in metropolitan areas (MA). They are particularly prominent in more recently formed MAs, such as those in certain locations in Spain, where the structure of the traditional city has undergone sweeping changes. Given the capacity of spatial metrics to characterize landscape structure, these metrics can be a valuable instrument to identify growth patterns in MAs and to evaluate possible urban growth options, based on spatial characteristics. This article focuses on a medium-sized MA (Granada, Spain), and explores the use of spatial metrics to quantify changes in the urban growth patterns reflected in three future scenarios (2020). The scenarios were simulated with a model based on cellular automata, which reproduced three urban growth processes (aggregation, compaction, and dispersion) and four urban growth patterns (aggregated, linear, leapfrogging, and nodal). The scenarios were evaluated with metrics that quantified changes in the spatial characteristics of urban processes. Thus, for example, the NP and AREA MN allowed us to characterize the decreased aggregation of high-density residential land uses in one scenario (S1) and the linear growth patterns in industrial land uses in another scenario (S2). In this way, spatial metrics were found to be useful for the evaluation of urban planning.

AB  - Full article: New York, USA, 25th September 2012—Poaching and the illicit trafficking of wildlife products were raised on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time this Monday, during discussions on strengthening national and international governance. World leaders gathering in New York for the global body’s 67th annual meeting highlighted wildlife trafficking along with other severe threats to the rule of law such as corruption and drug running.  In a written statement, permanent Security Council member United States highlighted “the harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts, rule of law, governance and economic development.” The rapidly-growing illicit international trade in endangered species products, such as rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger parts, is now estimated to be worth $5 billion per year globally.   “Such organized crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing,” Gabon’s President Ali Bongo said during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. “Gabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon. But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperation.”   Permanent member France also emphasized the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime. “There are still entire sectors of activity without any legal safety,” French Minister Delegate for Development Pascal Canfin said. “International law is lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural resources, for example, or the trafficking of fauna.”   President Bongo took the occasion to reaffirm his country’s commitment to “combating violations of the Convention on International Trade [in] Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora as well as other conventions to protect the environment and biodiversity.”  In response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa, President Bongo oversaw the burning of Gabon’s seized ivory stockpile earlier this year after a full audit supported by WWF and TRAFFIC. Organized criminal syndicates, sometimes linked to armed insurgent groups, are believed to be behind many of the tens of thousands of elephant poaching deaths occurring in Africa each year. Ivory tusks are highly valuable on Asian black markets.   “Illicit wildlife trafficking can have severe consequences for people as well as the environment, yet it is not considered a serious crime by many governments. It is often a low risk and high profit criminal activity, which is a dangerous combination,” said Wendy Elliott, WWF Global Species Programme Manager. “Governments have made a significant step forward by introducing the issue into this important forum on the rule of law. We now call on all them to increase their law enforcement responses to wildlife crime on a commensurate basis.” Roland Melisch, Director of TRAFFIC’s Africa & Europe programmes said: “Good governance is essential to prevent crimes such as illicit wildlife trafficking. Countries need to be held accountable to their commitments under relevant United Nations treaties.”  WWF and its partner TRAFFIC, the wildlife monitoring network, are campaigning for greater protection of threatened species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants. In order to save endangered animals, source, transit and demand countries must all improve law enforcement, customs controls and judicial systems. WWF and TRAFFIC are also urging governments in consumer countries to undertake demand reduction efforts to curb the use of endangered species products.

AB  - Global tendencies of urban structure changes, resulting from changes in technology and in the economy show first evidence by causing decentralization in the surroundings of big cities (Sassen, 1994). Such changes are taken as a challenge to look for new patterns of urban structure development and for new policies of development guidance in East Germany. The paper acknowledges the differences between east and west German traces of long-term urban structure development. The contribution regards the problems of East-German towns (inner area decline, loss of population, repeated waves of sub-urbanisation under GDR and FRG- governments) as indicators for opportunities in urban structure development. It concentrates on a case of example, a site in the city of Magdeburg, where the property market shows interest despite the fact that the town continues to loose inhabitants since 1990. Being part of the restructuring of an old industrialised area beside an old local core, being located near to the city centre and adjacent to the river Elbe, the site represents equally opportunities for the development of urban structure and of urban space. The urban qualities of the location indicate the opportunity for a new "nucleus" of urban development and promise a contribution to a competitive regional economy (s. Healey, 1993). Therefore, general criteria for qualities of urban development (Bentley e.a.) are referred to as a scale for evaluating existing and new conditions of the usability and the legibility of urban structures. This scale is supposed to represent processes of development which aim to a differentiated system of private and public spaces in a changing system of interconnected hierarchies of urban space. The article comprises - firstly, defining the subject and the questions of investigation, - secondly, introducing the reflection of long term and recent political influences on urban structure and urban space and reminding the major changes in property ownership from 1990, - thirdly, regarding the case of example concerning indications for new patterns of urban development and understandings of co-operation and competition from a practical point of view by evaluating the approach of the community in comparison to a students project, having been supervised by the author, - finally, drawing conclusions from the case about perspectives for guidance through planning gain which may provide new patterns of urban structure, new forms of cooperation and an alternative understanding of competition in the planning and development process.

AB  - A labor market model is developed within an urban spatial context, where it is shown that efficiency-wage policies can lead to significant levels of involuntary unemployment. Commuting cost differences between workers and nonworkers tend to increase unemployment, and competition for land tends to segregate workers and nonworkers, with nonworkers relegated to the urban fringe. These findings are extended to a two-city system, where it is shown that even with free mobility of workers, significant wage and unemployment differentials can exist between cities characterized by different levels of productivity.

These UCPs include state-mandated urban growth boundaries (UGBs), locally adopted urban growth boundaries and urban service areas (USAs). Population and employment density gradients, taken as concentration measures, are estimated for 135 metropolitan areas and are then used in a simultaneous equation model to assess the impacts of different UCPs on metropolitan spatial structure. The results suggest that state-mandated 'strong' UGBs more effectively promote growth within the boundaries than locally adopted UGBs or USAs.

At present, Chinese Urban Lighting Planning system is not yet perfectly organized, it is necessary that the method of making an urban landscape lighting plan needs in-depth study and then be put into practice. This paper first discusses the conceptual framework of urban landscape lighting master plan; proposes, based on urban structure, the theoretical foundation and a new planning method of urban landscape lighting. It provides a scientific basis and effective theoretical supports for the planning method of master plan of urban landscape lighting as result of a case study of Urban Lighting Planning of Central City District of Tianjin.

AB  - Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease globally and is usually associated with built environments in tropical areas. Remotely sensed information can facilitate the study of urban mosquito-borne diseases by providing multiple temporal and spatial resolutions appropriate to investigate urban structure and ecological characteristics associated with infectious disease. In this study, coarse, medium and fine resolution satellite imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and QuickBird respectively) and ground-based data were analyzed for the Greater Puntarenas area, Costa Rica for the years 2002-04. The results showed that the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generally higher in the localities with lower incidence of dengue fever during 2002, although the correlation was statistically significant only in the dry season (r = -0.40; p = 0.03). Dengue incidence was inversely correlated to built area and directly correlated with tree cover (r = 0.75, p = 0.01). Overall, the significant correlations between dengue incidence and urban structural variables (tree cover and building density) suggest that properties of urban structure may be associated with dengue incidence in tropical urban settings.

AB  - In this paper we consider urban spatial structure in US cities using a multidimensional approach. We select six key variables (commuting costs, density, employment dispersion and concentration, land-use mix, polycentricity, and size) from the urban literature and define measures to quantify them. We then apply these measures to 359 metropolitan areas from the 2000 US Census. The adopted methodological strategy combines two novel techniques for the social sciences to explore the existence of relevant patterns in such multidimensional datasets. Geodesic self-organizing maps (SOM) are used to visualize the whole set of information in a meaningful way, while the recently developed clustering algorithm of the max-p is applied to draw boundaries within the SOM and analyze which cities fall into each of them.

AB  - This paper is addressed to the problem of developing realistic-looking patterns of land use and activity from predictions generated by conventional urban models. The method developed is based on a geometric model of irregularity involving hierarchical cascading and recursion, whose rationale lies in the emergent field of fractal geometry. First the idea of fractans - shapes with fractional dimension - is introduced and then it is shown how two-dimensional patterns whose dimensions are consistent with a large city such as London can be simulated at different levels of detail or recursion. It is then argued that the hierarchical structure of cities should be exploited as a basis for such simulation, and it is argued that discrete choice models of individual spatial behaviour have excellent properties which enable their embedding into such simulations. The standard multinomial logit model is presented and then applied to house-type data in Greater London. A variety of models are estimated, house-type choice being related to age and distance from the centre of the city, and the spatial biases in these predictions are then mapped using prediction success statistics. These models are then used at the base level of a fractal simulation of house type and location in London. Random and deterministic model simulations are developed, and an unusual and possibly innovative feature of these simulations involves the way the inputs and outputs, data and predictions, are simultaneously displayed on the graphics device used. Conclusions for further research, particularly in spatial hierarchical modelling, are then sketched.

AB  - Based on the theories of the information entropy of urban land use structure, co-integration and error correction model, this thesis analyses the relationship between economic growth, urbanization level and the information entropy of urban land use structure. The information entropy values of China's urban land use structure from 1981 to 2004 have been calculated in this paper. The relationship between China's GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is investigated in details. The results indicate a co-integration relationship between GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure. However, there is no co-integration relationship between urbanization and the information entropy of urban land use structure. On the basis of the above analyses, the error correction model on GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is instituted. The application of the model shows that every 1% decrease in the information entropy value of urban land use structure demands a 59.53% growth in GDP. Because of the existing co-integration relationship between the economic growth and the information entropy of urban land use structure, the order degree of China's urban land use structure has relied heavily on the economic growth for a long time. The economic growth will significantly affect the optimal regulation of urban land use structure in the future. Further investigation also shows that economic growth and urbanization act as the direct driving force of the optimization of urban land use structure, but the optimization of urban land use structure can't promote the economic growth and the urbanization. Therefore, it becomes a very pressing strategic issue to adjust the economic structure and industrial distribution to optimize the distribution of urban land use and to optimize the structure of urban land use to improve the efficiency and promote the socio-economic development.

AB  - Cities around the world have marked differences in spatial form and structure. To some extent this can be attributed to cultural differences. However, the impact spatial form has on the interactions within and between residents of different neighbourhoods is unclear. This paper calls on empirical evidence collected in the Walled City of Ahmedabad, India, home to Hindu and Muslim residents in distinct neighbourhoods for centuries. Employing Space Syntax method, this paper reveals significant differences in how public spaces are spatially laid out by these two communities. Muslim neighbourhoods have a spatial structure typical of a naturally evolved settlement, where the most integrated spaces are clustered centrally. In contrast, Hindu neighbourhoods have an 'inside-out' pattern, with the most integrated spaces located at the neighbourhood edge. The cultural significance of these distinct forms is discussed alongside the relationship between the neighbourhoods and the rest of the city. These findings on spatial structure could have an important role in Ahmedabad's urban planning. A better understanding of how public space relates to lifestyle and culture could contribute to improved community relations. It could also contribute to dealing successfully with communal conflict, economic development, social sustainability as part of Ahmedabad's future urban planning strategies. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper examines the viability of some basic predictions of the Mills-Muth model of city structure for modern cities using US data for the year 2000. The estimation strategy used to test the predictions is very similar to that of Jan Brueckner and David Fansler, who use 1970 data to find support for the model's basic comparative statics predictions-namely, that city area is increasing in population and income but decreasing in agricultural land value and commuting costs. This paper uses different measures for land values and commuting costs where possible and a measure of polycentricity to estimate a slightly modified empirical model. Despite the changing structure of cities, there is evidence that the Mills-Muth comparative statics predictions hold for modern US cities, that densely populated cities are more likely to have sub-centres and that market forces drive urban spatial structure.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

Since the USTs of interest are usually chosen with respect to the research question, application and type of urban agglomeration there is a need for a flexible and adaptable approach for automatic UST classification. In this study we identify the commonalities of published approaches and derive requirements and tasks to deal with in UST classification. Based on this, we focus on the development of a UST classification system that is highly automated, flexible and adaptable to enable a wide applicability.

AB  - The structural characteristics of an urban area are determined to a great extent by the spatial pattern of land values. It is thus important to develop urban land value functions which accurately describe the spatial structure of cities. This paper provides evidence on the functional form of the relationship between land values and distance from the city center. Using historical data for Chicago, the Box and Cox transformation technique is employed to examine the land value function. The functional form parameter can be used to determine the price elasticity of demand for housing.

AB  - This paper expands empirical testing of the predictions of the standard monocentric urban model to examine the size of urban spatial expansion for all US metropolitan regions for the years 1980, 1990 and 2000. Until recently, the lack of temporally and spatially-consistently interpreted data on urban extent for U.S. metropolitan areas has limited the ability to estimate panel models of land use change. This paper first describes the creation of a consistent data set on urbanized land area for all U.S. metropolitan areas. It then estimates cross-sectional models of the determinants of urban spatial extent. For purposes of comparison, results are compared to temporally-consistent satellite-derived measures of developed land area from the National Land Cover Database. The paper then presents panel-model estimates of changes in urban land area, finding that both population and income elasticities are substantially less than unity. Tests for the structural stability of urbanized land area determinants across metropolitan size categories and polycentric regions are presented. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The paper derives equilibrium prices for a racist city and demonstrates that the city is less dense at the core, more dense in the suburbs, and covers a larger area than an unprejudiced city. A more complex theory of housing supply is then developed, and it is shown that racism's impact on the ghetto depends upon the ease with which maintenance can be reduced, the cost of replacing abandoned housing, and the nature of legal controls on housing quality.

AB  - The paper first examines urban spatial patterns of the gradients of housing and land prices and land development intensity, and then tests the relationship between the land price gradient and housing price gradient. Urban theory predicts the former is steeper than the latter based on the notion of derived demand for land from the provision of housing services. Finally the paper examines the impact of the property of housing production function on urban spatial structure. For the property of housing production function, we are particularly interested in the elasticity of capital-land substitution. The paper concludes (1) market influences over spatial structure, (2) the derived demand for land, and (3) it is the actual (or expected) housing price increases that cause skyrocketing land prices, not the other way around. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the characteristics of the urban land market in Kathmandu, the capital city of Nepal, in two stages by analysing land value variation in 2002 and 2009. In the first stage, it captures the characteristics of urban spatial structure, using the extended land value gradient model which includes not only the distance from the city centre but also zoning, road accessibility and planning variables as the determinants of land values. The estimates show that urban growth in Kathmandu has recently been characterized by neither centralization nor suburbanization with little shift in urban land demand between central and peripheral areas. Instead, land values have increased significantly across all urban areas, indicating the possibility of overall excess demand for urban plots. Correspondingly, in the second stage whether the supply is sufficient in urban land market is tested using two methods. First, by investigating the data on land pooling projects, urban land value after the project turns out to be greater than the sum of agricultural land value before the project and rural-to-urban conversion costs. Second, the actual or physical distance of urban-rural boundary turns out to be shorter than the theoretical or economic distance derived from the estimates of the extended gradient model. Both results confirm that urban land supply is in a shortage in Kathmandu. ©2012 The Institute of Urban Sciences.

AB  - Urban expansion as a dynamic process of land use change is a complicated social/economic phenomenon. It may be linked with details related to topography, transportation, land use, social structure and economic type, but it is generally related to demography and economy in a city. It is helpful for macro-planning and decision-making to have a simulation model available which considers these two factors. Since the spatial appearance of urban expansion is similar in some degree with a physical diffusion process, one easy way to model urban expansion under various scenarios is to build a simulation model based on basic diffusion. In this way, a clear mechanism of urban expansion is demonstrated. Population density is regarded as an internal driving factor and economy as an external push on urban expansion. Because of its computational features, this model is implemented with cellular automata. These have an advantage in that they allow the model to be extended and to be incorporated with other geographical systems. By applying the model to an actual example for scenario studies, we have shown that it can produce some valuable results through simulations at various scenarios. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - By integrating environmental traffic capacity (ETC) with traffic structure optimization (TSO) on urban road, influencing factors of ETC were analyzed, and the concept of TSO was introduced. Based on functional relationship between emission factors and vehicular speed, and the regression model of vehicular speed and traffic volume, a relation between traffic volume and traffic pollutants diffusion concentration was set up. A multi-objective optimization model, whose objectives were the maximum of traffic volume and traffic efficiency, was developed and its main constraints were the traffic capacity and the control concentration of pollutants in air quality standard, and then its solving algorithm was designed. The practical example study shows that there are different ETC values according to different environment air quality evaluation factors and the reasonable traffic structure is not only beneficial to improving road traffic efficiency, and also favorable to protecting environment air quality.

AB  - This paper focuses on the way urban dynamic processes challenge existing monitoring approaches and how Urban Structure Types (UST) support an effective urban management. Due to their microstructure and the instability of shape, the differentiation of settlement structures is substantially difficult. Hence, highly sophisticated data such as color infrared (CIR) ortho-photos as well as methods of image analysis, e.g. segmentation of objects will be employed. It will be shown how an object-oriented analysis strategy with CIR aerial photographs can be used to detect and discriminate different urban structure types by describing typical characteristics of color, texture, shape and context. The urban structure classification is characterized by identifying different types of buildings (different types of housing, industrial buildings, infrastructure) and open spaces (woodland, allotments, parks), their structural composition in terms of the amount, connectivity, and distribution of impervious surfaces, green spaces, and other open spaces on an aggregated neighborhood scale. This paper contributes to a transferable methodology to monitor the urban dynamics and structure on a local level.

Therefore, this paper adopts land value as the key criterion for the assessment of USLUS. A set of quantitative measures is proposed by settling the characteristics of the ULLUS as the combination of the neighborhood relationships and the mass balance of the USLUS as a whole so that metric information, topological information and thematic information are all taken into the consideration. Finally a conceptual evaluation is conducted. The research can provide both theoretical analysis and feasibility demonstration for building a physical ULUS simulation system.

This study focuses on a method to classify UST from land cover (LC) objects, which were derived from high resolution satellite images. The topology of urban LC objects is analyzed by implementing neighborhood LC-graphs. Various graph measures are examined by their potential to distinguish between different UST, using the machine learning classifier random forest. Additionally the influence of different parameter settings of the random forest model, the reduction of training samples, and the graph measure importance is analyzed. An independent test set is classified and validated, achieving an overall accuracy of 87%. It was found that the height of the building with the highest node degree has a strong impact on the classification result.

AB  - The phenomenon of Urban Heat Island is shown by an increase in temperature that mostly affects urban areas in comparison with the surrounding rural areas. This increase in temperature becomes problematic during the heat waves when it can give rise to problems of energy and health. The factors affecting this phenomenon are related to the morphology and location of the urban area, to the characteristics of building and roads materials, to the shape of urban structure. The paper investigates the phenomenon of UHI by analyzing in particular the influence of major urban planning features: the average height of buildings, the building density, the coverage ratio, the percentage of impermeable surface. The study was carried out starting from the analysis of a real case within the Province of Naples. The identification of areas liable to heat islands has been done by working out a thermal map of the Province of Naples through the creation of hyper-spectral satellite images using remote sensing techniques. This map has allowed to select some sample areas within which the main urban planning parameters have been detected through remote sensing techniques or spatial analysis. For each parameter, correlation curves "temperature - urban planning parameter" have been worked out. The main result is the development of an abacus that allows to estimate the expected temperature changes according to the decrease or increase of each urban parameter. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this paper, an analysis is made of the evolution of Spanish urban structure during the period 1900-99. It is postulated that the size distribution of the cities follows a Pareto distribution, which is estimated on a yearly basis. At the same time, the hypothesis is adopted that the intradistribution dynamics can be modelled by means of a Markov chain. In this way, are deduced the so-called transition matrix and its associated vector or ergodic probabilities. This methodology allows two main results to be obtained. First, this evolution has not been homogeneous ; there has been a divergent pattern of growth during the period 1900-70; and a convergent pattern for the period 1970-99. Secondly, the intradistribution movements in the Spanish urban hierarchy have been very significant during the course of the 20th century. In addition, the existence of spatial correlation has also been detected for those cities that have either entered or exited from the sample of the 100 largest cities during the course of the century. 10.1080/0042098032000053923

We study the impact of heterogeneity in tastes on urban structure using the simplest meaningful clone of the standard model: all arguments are presented in the context of a metropolitan area which is partitioned in two homogeneous zones, centre and suburd. Given that individuals have perfect knowledge, heterogeneity in tastes may affect equilibrium in two ways. Namely, individuals may differ with respect to their location decision and, at a particular location, they may differ with respect to how they allocate their initial resources. The strategy adopted here is to study these two effects in isolation.

AB  - This paper introduces an economic agent-based model of an urban housing market. The RHEA (Risks and Hedonics in Empirical Agent-based land market) model captures natural hazard risks and environmental amenities through hedonic analysis, facilitating empirical agent-based land market modeling. RHEA is well grounded in economic theory and uses rich spatial data and econometric analysis. It moves beyond the existing work by explicitly simulating the emergence of property prices and their spatial distribution under adaptive price expectations of heterogeneous agents, advancing toward empirical modeling of agent-based land markets. At the same time RHEA operates in a realistic GIS landscape where realtor and households agents form ask and bid prices using empirical hedonic price functions. The simulation results demonstrate that this combination of theoretically sound micro-foundations in agents' behavior and empirical data is feasible. This opens opportunities to explore various methodological and policy-relevant research questions including exploration of abrupt non-marginal changes in markets and regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Llrban structure may be viewed as an abstract or generalized description of the distribution of phenomena in urban geographic space. The concept incorporates such ideas as pattern, distance, morphology, and relative location. Description of spatialI elements-linear features, nodes, and surfaces within urban areas-is but one facet considered in the study of urban structure, however. Explanation and prediction also form important, if not crucial, steps in understanding structural and behavioral changes in the urban system over time. Several methodological approaches have been utilized by urban researchers to achieve explanation and prediction; this study adopts the behavioral approach, defined as &dquo;an attempt to derive a set of empirically valid statements about individual, group, or mass behavior which can form postulates in a theory yielding statements of spatial structure as logical outputs&dquo; (Horton and Reynolds, 1971: 36). This paper takes the view that criminal mobility is related to urban structure and that the analysis of movement behavior will yield insight into offender decision-making and spatial preferences and contribute significantly to our understanding of the urban system as a crime opportunity structure. Robbery offenders are treated as the actors at varying geographical locations who, with a certain amount of information concerning the location of criminal opportunities in urban space, undergo a decision-making process that eventually leads to specific kinds of spatial behavioral biases. Specifically, the paper has three main objectives: ( I ) to describe the distance biases of robbery offenders in metropolitan Miami, (2) to offer explanations of these biases by examining certain concepts of individual behavior as they relate to movement within Miami’s urban system, and (3) to outline the authors’ ongoing research within the area of criminal mobility.

Nighttime urban-rural climatic differences, however, are often significant—air temperature is warmer within cities at night, long-wave radiant heat load is greater, wind speed is often lower, and inside air temperature of characteristic urban buildings is warmer. Noeturnal urban heat islands of 4–7° are shown to be associated with heat waves in two cities. During heat waves inhabitants of urban areas may experience sustained thermal stresses both day and night while inhabitants of the outlying environs often obtain some relief from thermal stresses during nocturnal hours. It is suggested that excess deaths occurring in urban areas during periods of extreme heat can be significantly reduced through appropriate urban land use.

AB  - Full article: Alor Star, Malaysia, 7th February 2013—A court case involving Malaysia’s biggest ever seizure of trafficked Tiger parts today saw the conviction of a 29-year old man, who was sentenced to a total 60 months in prison. However Mohd Nor Shahrizam Nasir, found guilty on two charges of illegal possession of Tiger parts and one for possession of African Elephant ivory, will only serve 24 months in jail as the judge ordered that his sentences run concurrently. A conviction under the section of the law involving Tiger parts also carries a mandatory fine of "not less than RM100,000 and not more than RM500,000 and a jail term not exceeding five years.” However, the court did not issue the mandatory fine. In February last year, he was arrested at this home where Wildlife Department officers found eight Tiger skins, 22 bags of Tiger skulls and bones and nine African Elephant tusks.  Mohd Nor Shahrizam, from the town of Alor Star in northern Peninsular Malaysia claimed trial to charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010. This morning he was handed down a sentence of 24 months each on the charges of keeping the eight Tiger skins, and the 22 Tiger skulls and bones. He received a further 12-month jail term on the third charge of keeping African Elephant tusks. Judge Mohd Rosli Osman granted the defence a stay pending an appeal and ordered that the convicted man’s bail, initially set at RM70,000, be increased by an additional RM10,000. If Mohd Nor Shahrizam raises bail, he will be free pending his appeal.   TRAFFIC welcomed the conviction but noted its concern that the sentence imposed contradicted the provision of the laws under which Mohd Nor Shahrizam was charged. “This is shocking given that the mandatory fine is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is also disappointing considering it has taken 13 years of hard work and the effort of so many to include a punitive minimum fine for heinous wildlife crimes,” said TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director Dr William Schaedla. TRAFFIC has learnt that the prosecution will seek a revision of the sentence. Schaedla also disagreed with the argument raised by the defence during the trial; that the crime in question was insignificant because it did not involve loss of life. “Such arguments fail to recognize that the arrest in this case was linked to the largest Tiger seizure Malaysia has ever seen – eight skins and the skulls and bones of 22 Tigers were impounded from the culprit’s Alor Star residence,” he said. “It also contradicts recent international developments that are putting wildlife crime on a par with other serious crimes such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking.” “The short jail term and the lack of a fine are a demoralizing finale to what should have been a victory against wildlife crime. We hope the lapse does not crush the spirit of those authorities who are still working hard to protect Malaysia’s 500 remaining Tigers.”

AB  - Urban land use and transportation policies have dramatic effects on the density and spatial distribution of residences in large cities. Effects of these policies have been analyzed using numerical urban simulation models. At the same time, the US Energy Information Administration's Residential Energy Consumption Survey has allowed researchers to investigate the relation between household energy consumption and characteristics of housing units.This paper links these two lines of inquiry by demonstrating how simulation results on the implications of land use and transportation policies for the spatial form of cities can be used to compute implications for energy consumption. The resulting Urban Energy Footprint Model, " UEFM," allows one to trace the implications of a change in land use zoning or transportation policy through its effects on housing markets and residential location to the resulting changes in energy use for residential and commuting purposes - i.e. to understand the energy footprint of transportation, housing, and land use policies. Accordingly, the UEFM provides, perhaps for the first time, a link between urban and energy economics, and can allow measurement of rebound effects of energy policies in a more general equilibrium context. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Urban structure type (UST) mapping is widely used for assessing the ecological situation in the frame of urban planning. A wide range of spatial indicators has been developed for quantitative characterization of USTs. This requires detailed urban surface material inventories. Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing allow automated identification of surface materials. In this paper, a multi-stage processing system for flexible calculation of urban land cover indicators is presented and applied to a study area in Munich, Germany. The system uses hyperspectral images and height information and includes the stages (1) preprocessing, (2) hyperspectral surface material mapping, (3) indicator calculation and (4) multi-level validation. In the study area 38 spectrally distinct surface materials have been automatically mapped. They form the basis for the derivation of 7 spatial indicators describing the urban land cover. The mean absolute error for the surface material identification amounts to less than 8% and for indicator calculation the mean errors range between 3 and 11%. The validation has shown the general suitability of the developed approach for analyzing large urban areas. Limitations occur in mapping of surface materials of small urban objects. Further statistical analysis has revealed typical combinations of indicator values for each UST. Finally, the results were compared to indicators estimated by the municipality of Munich, demonstrating that they are comparable to currently available mapping products. The presented study showed the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for efficient and up-to-date derivation of urban land cover indicators for use in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land-cover and land-use (LCLU) change was quantified for the last 35 years within and in the vicinity of a fast growing city in Mexico, using rectified aerial photographs and geographic information systems (GIS). LCLU change was projected for the next 20 years using Markov chains and regression analyses. The study explored the relationships between urban growth and landscape change, and between urban growth and population growth. The analysis of Markov matrices suggests that the highest LCLU attractor is the city of Morelia, followed by plantations and croplands. Grasslands and shrublands are the least stable categories. The most powerful use of the Markov transition matrices seems to be at the descriptive rather than the predictive level. Linear regression between urban and population growth offered a more robust prediction of urban growth in Morelia. Hence, we suggest that linear regression should be used when projecting growth tendencies of cities in regions with similar characteristics. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The acquired mental representation then consists of the directly observed, physically accessible parts of the city. In this paper, we propose a computational model to construct images of cities, adapting their content depending on the wayfinder's access constraints. First, we formally study and extend the classification of Lynch's elements of the city form. Second, we propose a simple approach to analyzing local functional relationships between these elements, as experienced by wayfinders. The study of the functional relationships allows for the construction of the most complete image of the city that might be acquired by a wayfinder with given accessibility characteristics. These representations of urban environments can support advanced spatial assistance systems and cognitively efficient spatial interfaces. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the authors proposed that three components of urban land consumption be recognized in measuring urban land consumption: direct; indirect visible; and indirect less visible urban land uses. The indirect less visible uses are those that are present because of a nearby urban center, but which are not directly identifiable as urban, i.e., they are often difficult to distinguish visually from rural land uses. The indirect less visible component is comprises of two land use categories: the first is land used by exurbanites; the other is termed 'transitional land.' The latter category includes land that has not been built upon but which has started through the processes associated with urban development. This article describes a method for estimating the amount of land in the transitional category and applies the method in two study ares.

They may even distort our images of spatial patterns and relationships at one point in time.  One response to the definitional question is to develop a wide spectrum of definitions of the city, each one suitable for different purposes.  Then wthn patterns and relationships are compared across these differing sets of units we can then evaluate their sensitivity to changes in the size of the areas and the location of boundaries.

Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land area.s. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

AB  - Cities represent an important threat to biodiversity at different scales. Nevertheless, little is known on the processes underlying such effects. In this paper we describe bird diversity, structure, and composition patterns in different urban land-use categories. For this, we surveyed resident bird communities in four representative land-use categories of southwestern Mexico City. Our results show that bird communities vary greatly along the different studied urban land-uses, which represent an urbanization development gradient. Bird communities were highly dominated by few generalist species in areas with commercial components, while showed to have higher evenness values in green areas. Bird species richness decreased and bird abundances increased with urbanization intensity. Also, our results indicate that bird species richness and abundance values are sensible to site-specific habitat characteristics. Although we did not find a clear pattern of taxonomic homogenization related to urbanization, our results show that urbanization development entails the functional homogenization of bird communities. Thus, based on our results, we suggest three urban planning and management activities: (1) regulate land-use change related to urbanization; (2) increase the number of green areas within the city; (3) establish bird monitoring programs to identify focal areas that need management and assist with ecological data for urban planning.

With the help of single land use type dynamic degree model and expansion elasticity coefficient model, spatial-temporal features of urban land expansion in the recent 20 years in Harbin had been analyzed. The results showed that, firstly, urban land area had increased 123.93 km super(2), and it was more rapid during the period from 1996 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2008 with the annual expansion rates of 3.24% or 3.52%. Secondly, the urban expansion scale fluctuated within the rational region from 1989 to 1996. The expansion was much too quicker than the rate of population increasing from 1996 to 2002. And urban land sprawled continuously, but it was slower than the population increasing rate from 2002 to 2008. Thirdly, the expansion in SWS from 1989 to 1996 was more obvious, where area reached 3.61 km super(2). From 1996 to 2002, the expansion area in NWN and SWW was much larger, which was 18.37 km super(2) and 8.78 km super(2) respectively. And the expansion was much concentrated in the direction of NWW, with the area of 20.45 km super(2), which was mainly caused by the large scale construction in Songbei District. Fourthly, the driving mechanism influencing urban land expansion in Harbin had been discussed on the aspects of economy increasing, population amount, traffic traction and policy and urban plan etc., which was of some theory reference in directing the rational urban plan and promoting city in reasonable development.

In all scenarios, urban growth arises from the increase in population particularly, due to tourism and economic change. However, the spatial patterns are different due to alternative assumptions about urban development processes/purposes. The results of modelling are successfully illustrated in a spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for year 2020.

AB  - Full article: A project to promote sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plants in the mountains of China’s Upper Yangtze ecoregion has won the prestigious Equator Prize 2012.   The Equator Prize recognizes outstanding local initiatives working to advance sustainable development solutions for people, nature and resilient communities in countries receiving support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).   It is the second time the success of the project has been publicly acknowledged; in October 2011, the project received an “Outstanding Contribution Award” from the Chinese State Ministry of Environmental Protection, EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), Ministry of Commerce and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Over-harvesting of wild medicinal plant species is a serious conservation concern—aside from problems caused by the harvesting itself, the collectors can also have serious secondary impacts through camping within reserves, hunting and gathering fuel-wood to dry commercial quantities of medicinal plants. Such habitat destruction and disturbance also threatens endangered wildlife, including the Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the Takin Budorcas taxicolor.   The collection of medicinal plants in the Upper Yangtze is rising, with households compensating for loss of income from farming and timber logging due to the promulgation of two policies: a 1998 logging ban and a “Grain for Green” programme, introduced in 2000, which discourages farming on steep slopes.  To help alleviate matters, an initiative was developed through a comprehensive collaboration between WWF, IUCN and TRAFFIC as part of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), which led to local producer association members, harvesters and governmental officials receiving training in the implementation of organic wild crop harvesting practices and certification procedures, as well as application of the FairWild Standard principles.   “We are delighted to see public recognition of the success of this initiative, which has demonstrated how sustainable harvesting of wild plant resources creates positive benefits for local livelihoods and conservation efforts,” said Anastasiya Timoshyna, TRAFFIC’s Medicinal Plant Programme Leader.  Income for local producers in the project areas has increased, thanks to higher prices paid for certified sustainably harvested medicinal and aromatic plants. In the case of Schisandra berries Schisandra sphenanthera, international and local buyers paid at least 30% above normal market prices for certified produce. A survey of project sites in March 2011 found incomes from medicinal plant collection had risen, thanks to the certification schemes; in one village by almost 18% over 2007 levels.   The project also led to the establishment of links between producer associations and buyer groups: two communities have signed purchase agreements with a local winery and the newly established Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Cooperative has signed a 5-year fair trade agreement with a Californian company for supply of sustainably harvested Schisandra fruits.   In 2010, more than 5 tonnes (dry weight) of Schisandra fruits were sustainably harvested of which more than 3 tonnes were sold to Draco Natural Products (DNP Shanghai) for production of a concentrated dry extract specified by US-based Traditional Medicinals Inc (TMI). The project has scaled up from one village in the 2008 and 2009 harvests up to 22 villages in the 2011 harvest. From the autumn 2011 harvest, about 11.5 tonnes were shipped to DNP, enough to produce about 1.2 tonnes of certified organic dried extract for use in TMI products.   Further development of the project, supported through the Kangmei Institute of Community Development and Marketing has seen further adoption of sustainable harvesting methods in the region, and communities working through international partnerships to promote a ‘giant panda friendly’ brand and to create panda friendly certification standards for local harvesters.   “This project is proving that local harvesters from villages surrounding the Giant Panda conservation area can successfully implement meaningful sustainability standards,” said Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability for TMI.  “The Schisandra harvesters are helping to protect the panda bear habitat from disturbance while working to conserve biodiversity and earning additional household income through an organic and fair price premium.  “Traditional Medicinals remains committed to a long-term equitable trade relationship with the 22 participating villages represented by the Shuijing TCM Cooperative.   “Schisandra is only the first success story. As other wild medicinal plant species are added to the cooperative’s sustainable wild harvesting management plan, with eventual certified organic and panda friendly designations, household income will increase as a result of empowering and rewarding local communities for the important work of nature conservation.”

When households do not observe the price of the public good directly and because of the external economy arising from city size, the local government cannot determine the optimal property tax rate from empirical observation of consumer behavior. The relation between the property tax rate and city size is indeterminate. When land is necessary for public good production, there is an optimal amount of revenue sharing. The property tax rate alone, only under exceptional circumstances, can be used to limit city size and the amount of land in housing production.

AB  - First of all, systematic studies are conducted on the spatial variation of population in Hangzhou over more than 30 years, based on data from several national censuses including the most recent one, the fifth census in 2000. It is found that centripetal movements of population in Hangzhou dominated in the 1960s and 1970s, while centrifugal movements of population dominated and suburbanization occurred in the 1980s. Throughout the 1990s, the centrifugal movements and suburbanization of population greatly accelerated. This study also examines the distribution of temporary population in 1983, 1991, and 2000. Based on the spatial variation of total urban population during different periods and the distribution of temporary population in different years, models of the changes in internal urban spatial structure in Hangzhou are developed. By analyzing urban industrial land-use data and its distribution changes, we find that industrial suburbanization started and developed in Hangzhou in the 1980s, and that its pace has quickened during the period 1996-2000. Detailed descriptions and analyses are presented on the development of industrial suburbanization and the evolution of industrial spatial structure in Hangzhou. It is concluded that industrial suburbanization spurred the evolution of industrial spatial structure rationally and effectively in Hangzhou. Suburbanization of population and industry gradually deformed the shape of the Hangzhou urban area from handlike to fanlike one. Copyright © 2005 by V. H. Winston & Son, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - China launched an ambitious urban land-use reform to improve land-use efficiency, raise funds for infrastructure construction, and facilitate foreign investment in the late 1980s. Few studies have systematically evaluated the effects of the market mechanisms on land-use changes in Chinese cities. This paper takes the city of Beijing as a case study to quantify the magnitude of land-use changes and model it in relation to spatial and market drivers through time and across the metropolitan region. The analysis uses unique district-level land survey data from 1992, 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008, as well as land granting records. Analysis reveals that, since the urban land market was established in 1992, the spatial pattern of land uses has changed dramatically in Beijing, land price has exerted a significantly influence on land-use conversion, and the municipal recognition of an open market for land assets has set the spatial–temporal pattern of land uses on a course that sharply differs from past trends in Beijing.

AB  - The unprecedented urban economic growth in China has created a huge demand for urban land. Built upon the standard monocentric city model, this empirical study investigates the determinants of urban spatial scale of Chinese cities using a cross-sectional dataset from 650 Chinese cities. The estimates are surprisingly similar to those found for US cities, with four basic factors (population, income, commuting cost and price of rural land) explaining most of the variation in urban spatial scale of Chinese cities. The findings clearly show that although land use in Chinese cities may have inherited many centrally planned features, market forces today exert a very significant influence. The study also shows that the urban spatial scale of Chinese cities is better understood by a model that consolidates features of both 'closed' and 'open' cities proposed in the standard urban land economics literature.

It is known that interactions between di erent parts of the city are subject to a distance decay, moreover, our ndings show that regardless of the time of the day or current activity, people tend to communicate within a spatially enclosed community. Furthermore, we have investigated transitions and transformations of these communities at the temporal scales of several hours related to the cycles of human movement and activities in a city.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical study of the links between metropolitan spatial structure and economic growth. Consistent with an urban evolution hypothesis, the growth effects of employment dispersion were found to be dependent on metropolitan size. A metropolitan area with a more clustered spatial form grows faster, perhaps enjoying agglomeration economies when it is small; whereas more dispersion leads to higher growth rates as metro areas grow large. Just as a city needs to successfully take on higher-order functions and economic activities to move upward within the national urban system, it also needs to restructure its spatial form in a way to mitigate congestion or other diseconomies of size for continued growth. Therefore, attempts to find one specific efficient urban form – at least with respect to growth – may not be promising, just as the efforts to find an optimal city size have not been fruitful.

AB  - Chinese economic reforms since 1978 have been a continuous process of fundamental institutional change. The new institution of ambiguous property rights over state-owned urban land evolves from the socialist people's landownership. This institutional change is driven by the changing economic system and by two new organisations-the local developmental state and danwei-enterprises. The new institution facilitates the formation of an emerging land market. This land market, structured by ambiguous property rights, has accounted for the dynamic urban physical growth in many of China's coastal cities in the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, massive rent dissipation induced by the new institution does not provide market certainty, nor does it offer incentives for optimal development. The cost incurred by the institution is gradually overtaking its benefit. The ambiguous property rights are deemed to be a transitional institution during the development of land markets in urban China.

AB  - Going beyond previous investigations into urban land use and travel, Petter Næss presents new research from Denmark on residential location and travel to show how and why urban spatial structures affect people's travel behaviour. In a comprehensive case study of the Copenhagen metropolitan area, Næss combines traditional quantitative travel surveys with qualitative interviews in order to identify the more detailed mechanisms through which urban structure affects travel behaviour. The case study findings are compared with those from other Nordic countries and analyzed and evaluated in the light of relevant theory and literature to provide solid, valuable conclusions for planning sustainable urban development. With a broader range of statistics than previous studies and conclusions of international relevance, Urban Structure Matters provides well-grounded conclusions for how spatial planning of urban areas can be used to reduce car dependence and achieve a more sustainable development of cities.

AB  - "The few existing empirical studies of high-status migrants in Western European cities suggest that classical urban models describing and explaining the segregation of immigrant groups in the city do not apply to these movers.  When compared to low-status movers of the recent past, high-status movers display certain marked differences, particularly in the presence of dependants from the outset and in voluntary extensive employer involvement in housing provision or search, but there are also similarities in their restriction to the privately-rented housing sector.  The characteristics and location of high-status migrants and of gastarbeiter in Vienna are here compared, demonstrating that there is a need for new urban models to deal with high-status migrant settlement in Western European cities."

AB  - A model experiment has been carried out in order to examine the effect of surface irregularity of an urban structure on the anomalous absorption of incident solar radiation. Several models of an urban structure resembling buildings and canyons were constructed by using concrete blocks in cubic form. By building and dismantling the urban models, the albedo change as a function of solar zenith angle was observed throughout the year. The result shows that the absorption increment originating from the irregular urban structure amounts to about 20% as compared with the absorption by a flat surface of the same material. The amount of additional absorption depends on the relative area occupied by canyons in the model.

AB  - The growing proportion of human populations living in urban areas, and consequent trends of increasing urban expansion and densification fuel a need to understand how urban form and land use affect environmental quality, including the availability of urban green spaces. Here we use Sheffield as a case study of city-wide relationships between urban green space extent, quality (vegetation cover and tree-cover), and gradients in urban form and topography. The total area of buildings and length of the road network are equally strong negative predictors of extent of green space, while the former predictor is a more important negative influence upon green space quality. Elevation positively influences extent of green space but negatively influences tree-cover. In contrast, slope of terrain positively influences green space quality and is the best predictor of tree-cover. Overall housing density is a more important negative predictor of extent of green space and tree-cover than the densities of individual housing types. Nevertheless, the latter are more important influences upon levels of vegetation cover. Threshold effects of densities of different housing types suggest opportunities for optimising green space quality, with implications for housing policy. Variation in ecological quality of green space may partly reflect different historical intensities of industrial activity

AB  - China is experiencing urbanization at an unprecedented rate over the last two decades. The overall goal of this paper is to understand the extent of and the factors driving urban expansion in China from the late 1980s to 2000. We use a unique three-period panel data set of high-resolution satellite imagery data and socioeconomic data for entire area of coterminous China. Consistent with a number of the key hypotheses generated by the monocentric model, our results demonstrate the powerful role that the growth of income has played in China's urban expansion. In some empirical models, the other key variables in the monocentric model-population, the value of agricultural land and transportation costs-also matter. Adapting the basic empirical model to account for the environment in developing countries, we also find that industrialization and the rise of the service sector appear to have affected the growth of the urban core, but their role was relatively small when compared to the direct effects of economic growth. We also make a methodological contribution, demonstrating the potential importance of accounting for unobserved fixed effects. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A place exists in a space (footprint) which evolves over a temporal extent (lifeline). This study focuses on those places such as cities or component places within cities (hereafter referred to as city places or simply places). It concerns the modeling and analysis of places from the integrative spatio-temporal perspective. Drawing on recent research development related to spatio-temporal ontology, this study discusses a spatio-temporal ontology specific to city places. The ontology distinguishes between the static view of places (Static-Place) and the dynamic view of spatial-temporal regions led by spatio-temporal processes (ST-Place). The study considers places as spatio-temporal constructs. It proposes the concept of primitive ST region for the construction of spatio-temporal regions and ultimately spatio-temporal places. The study then presents a spatio-temporal data model to link spatial features and the spatio-temporal processes. In this way, the study models an ST-place from a spatio-temporal perspective by forming high dimensional spatio-temporal regions. Based on this conceptual data model, the study further discusses the potential use of this model in spatio-temporal analysis in general and in reasoning spatio-temporal topological relations in particular.

The analysis is a case study of the urban agglomeration\non different levels of global, national, provincial and local scales, on\nthe basis of those conclusions are drawn: 1) Within the scope of the\nurban agglomeration, the cities should be reasonably sized and\nappropriately densified; the spatial combination of the urban\nagglomeration ought to be orderly, and its eco-spatial structure ought\nto be optimized and efficient; the relationship between the economic\nsociety and eco-spatial environment ought to be that of mutual benefit\nand co-evolution. 2) ``The mode of corridor group network{''} is a\ncertain trend evoked from the spatial structure of urban agglomeration.\n3) The eco-spatial structure of urban agglomeration under ``the mode of\ncorridor group network{''} can farther increase the environmental\ncapacity of urban agglomeration, and is in favor of the harmonious\nrelationship between man and nature.

AB  - This article looks at the issues that threaten the success of suburban areas. Many suburbs--like Buckhead, a suburb of Atlanta--have become successful because they cater to the needs of their residents; however, traffic congestion, inadequate land use planning, and competition from outer-ring suburbs threaten the suburb, just as they threatened inner-city areas. Suburban areas must have upscale housing as well as nearby affordable housing for workers, nearby shopping, ample recreation and entertainment, security, good schools, access to major transportation arteries, and a diversified tax base. Inefficiently allocated resources and car domination lead to problems in the suburbs. Better planning and the banning together of community member s can help solve some of the problems facing suburbs.

AB  - Full article: Geneva, Switzerland, 26th July 2012—Statisticians from the University of Reading in partnership with TRAFFIC are helping in the global fight against the trade of illegal ivory, with a major revision of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), a global monitoring system for tracking illegal ivory trade.  With elephant poaching levels the worst they have been in a decade, and recorded ivory seizures at their highest levels since 1989, the revised system will give accurate and up-to-date information on the illegal trade of ivory. This will be of huge benefit for international and national policy makers on elephant conservation and on illicit trade who have previously struggled to get reliable and timely data.  At the heart of the upgrade is an innovative new database that allows countries to report seizures of illegal ivory online, making data entry easier and more accurate than ever before.  It will also encourage more countries to report illegal ivory trade as they will be able to access statistical summaries of their data and review other seizures where their country is implicated.  TRAFFIC manages ETIS on behalf of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is one of two elephant monitoring systems under CITES, the other being the Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) system.  The revised online ETIS will be showcased today at the CITES Standing Committee currently taking place in Geneva. In attendance will be representatives from many of the CITES Parties who will use the revised system. They will witness the functionality and the effectiveness of the database by way of a demonstration, ahead of its launch in September 2012.  Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood, statisticians from the University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, have worked closely with TRAFFIC to develop the revised ETIS. Dr Underwood, project leader, said: "We are very pleased that we are able to provide a solid statistical foundation to ETIS to ensure that it provides high quality and timely information on the illegal ivory trade at a crucial time for elephants." Recording illegal ivory seizures is just one aspect of the revised monitoring system, which now has enhanced capability to provide indicators of hidden illegal activity.  Applied Statistics Research Fellow Bob Burn, who conceived the current project and has been involved with ETIS since its inception in 1997, said: "Not all illegal ivory transactions are discovered or officially reported.  The challenge in analysing seizures data is to adjust for this gap by accounting for factors such as law enforcement effort and corruption. Using cutting edge statistical methods the monitoring system can now begin to combat this problem."  The statistical analyses will provide information on how patterns of illegal trade are changing over time and will identify problem countries so that attention can be focused upon those countries most heavily implicated in illicit trade. This provides crucial evidence for CITES and individual governments in their decision making when it comes to elephant conservation. The work was carried out under a Darwin Initiative project, led by the University of Reading, funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  UK Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: "These magnificent creatures are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers, and if we don't act now they may not have a future. This database, funded by Defra's Darwin Initiative, will accurately record illegal ivory seizures so we get a real picture of what is happening on the ground. This information can be shared around the world to help stop the illegal trade in ivory and put poachers out of business."  TRAFFIC's Tom Milliken, who manges ETIS, added: "Since 1997, our long-term collaboration with Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood from the University of Reading has progressively scaled up the science behind ETIS and made it a ‘best practice', state-of-the-art monitoring tool for the global conservation community.  TRAFFIC, but also elephants, trumpet their appreciation to Bob and Fiona and the Darwin Initiative!"  The database was developed in collaboration with Solertium Corporation, USA.

AB  - Ecological land is one of the most important components of urban Social-Economic-Natural Complex Ecosystem, it can provide various important ecosystem services for urban areas. Using Remote Sensing, Geography Information Science technology and landscape index analysis software, focusing on the scientific problem of urban ecological land and ecosystem services, on the basis of analyzing four-phase remote sensing images of Changzhou in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006, we got the evolution of landscape spatial structure of Changzhou during the past 15 years and assessed changes of ecosystem services generated by urban ecological land. The results show that the ecological land proportion of land-use decreased from 89. 2% to 65. 1%. During 1991 to 2001, the areas of forests, fields and water had a decreasing tendency. During 2001 to 2006, the areas of forests turned back to that of 1996. Ecological land in Changzhou have provided ecosystem services including agricultural and forestry production, climatic regulation, conservation of water resource, soil and water conservation, biodiversity protection, etc. During 1991 to 2006, the value of ecosystem services provided by ecological land has reduced 19. 3%. The decrease of ecosystem services value provided by agricultural lands was the largest of all and it decreased 32. 3%. The results showed strong correlation between landscape spatial structure and ecosystem services of Changzhou city. This paper can provide scientific methods and decision making for strengthening of urban ecosystem services, land use planning and management, urban sustainable development, etc.

AB  - When analysing the spatial housing market structure of urban areas, a frequently arising question concerns the relevant criteria for housing market segmentation: is it the transaction price or related to other, socioeconomic, demographic and physical features of the location? In this study, two neural network techniques (SOM, LVQ, Kohonen) are used for identifying sub-markets within Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Because of the inductive nature of the modelling, any theory has to be understood in an open sense: generalising the principles of classification to another context to enable elaboration of institutionally sensitive housing market theory. These findings are therefore compared with earlier findings from another urban housing market-namely, Helsinki, Finland. The comparison shows that, while the price alone is an insufficient criterion for both markets, Amsterdam is more fragmented than Helsinki. © 2004 The Editors of Urban Studies.

AB  - Monitoring growth and change along the metropolitan periphery is of critical concern both to those who study metropolitan dynamics and those who must manage resources and provide services in these rapidly changing environments. This research has been directed to assess urban spatial growth and land change along the outskirts of Atlanta, one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the United States in the past three decades. A time series of satellite images was used to trace the development of urban land uses for the period of 1973 to the present. An image processing and GIS-based method was developed to achieve the research goal. Results reveal that every week, more than one-hundred acres of forest, green space, and farmland in the Atlanta region were converted into urban uses. Between 1973 and 1999, the urban territorial extent has expanded by 247 percent for 13 metro counties while the population increased by 96 percent. The rate Of urban growth was much higher in outer suburban counties. Concomitant with this high rate of urban growth was a for reaching evolution in Atlanta's urban spatial form. The growth of high-density urban use (mainly commercial, transportation, industrial, and high-rise residential) is found to experience a clear transition from linearly concentrated form towards a multinucleated pattern. The spread of low-density urban use (mainly residential) exhibited a widely dispersed pattern, thus indicating a major feature of the suburbanization. In addition, Atlanta has few physical barriers to urban development; this growth in urban physical extent seems to be unlimited as the population and business continue to grow, particularly in the outer suburbs.

AB  - Fieldwork at Tiwanaku sites in recent decades has opened new avenues of inquiry into the characteristics of the Tiwanaku polity, but archaeology has been hampered by the inability to make large-scale characterizations of the organization of urban and monumental space because of the depositional processes that interred its cities and monuments. In this paper, we use several geophysical techniques, including magnetometry, electrical resistivity, and ground-penetrating radar to begin to visualize some of these spaces. In doing so, we outline a methodology for recreating the urban spatial structure of the six-square-kilometer Tiwanaku capital. Our preliminary work compares excavations at the Putuni, Mollo Kontu, and Akapana East sectors with geophysical data that has expanded our understanding of both residential and monumental spaces to provide a first glimpse at the potential of imaging Tiwanaku’s buried urban structure

AB  - The urban spatial structure of Chinese cities has been changing since the post-Mao economic reform in 1978. More dramatic changes have occurred since the housing reform in 1982 and land reform in 1987. This article examines the transformation of urban spatial structure in China in the context of a transitional economy and its underlying dynamics. The land use changes in Guangzhou are used for a case study. The major findings are rapid decentralization through leapfrog developments in peripheral areas and the re-emergence of business and service areas in the city centre. The authors present a model of a new urban spatial structure and discuss its implications for urban planning. © American Planning Association.

AB  -  The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between the surface temperature distribution and urban structure in Tokyo metropolitan area. ASTER data and LIDAR data both are used for this analysis. The daytime (2001.9.24 at 10:39 JST) and night (2001.9.22 at 21:54 JST) scenes of ASTER TIR are used for the surface temperature in daytime and night. The same daytime scene of ASTER VNIR is also used for the land-cover. LIDAR data, 3D point clouds from the remote airborne mapping system, is used for the building height. As results, the distribution of the surface temperature is high at residential areas and low at business centers and main roads in daytime, and then it is reversed in night. The correlation between the surface temperature and the urban structure shows 1) green areas have a good impact on the urban heat environment and these areas are not enough, and 2) tall buildings make shadows and fall the surface temperature in daytime, but raise it for obstructing winds in night.

AB  - In this paper, I consider a general equilibrium urban spatial structure in the setting of a port city by adopting Cobb-Douglas type functional forms for production and utility functions. Unlike previous port-city models, this one can generate four land-use patterns, that is, monocentric, completely integrated, partially integrated (with integration at the center), and partially integrated (with integration at the urban fringe) land-use patterns, and the last pattern suggests a new explanation of suburbanization of employment. The existence and uniqueness of each land-use pattern is proven in a simple constructive way. -Author
