AB  - This article deals with the problem of modelling the population densities\nof cities. A historical introduction is given. There are two types\nof models, namely the `quadratic gamma' family which can be summarized\nby the formula <br /><br /><i>D(r) = A exp</i>(<i>br + cr<sup>2</sup></i>)<i>r<sup>d</sup></i>\n<br /><br />where <i>D</i>is the population density, <i>r</i>the\nradial distance, <i>A, b, c</i>and <i>d</i>constants; and the `equilibrium'\nmodels which have been derived by using civic state and equilibrium\nequations. Details of the development and verification of the various\ntypes of models are given, and finally the models are tested and\ncompared using the data for the city of Coventry.

AB  - Understanding the endogenous factors that drive the population dynamics of malaria mosquitoes will facilitate more accurate predictions about vector control effectiveness and our ability to destabilize the growth of either low- or high-density insect populations. We assessed whether variation in phenotypic traits predict the dynamics of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato mosquitoes, the most important vectors of human malaria. Anopheles gambiae dynamics were monitored over a six-month period of seasonal growth and decline. The population exhibited density-dependent feedback, with the carrying capacity being modified by rainfall (97% wAIC(c) support). The individual phenotypic expression of the maternal (p = 0.0001) and current (p = 0.040) body size positively influenced population growth. Our field-based evidence uniquely demonstrates that individual fitness can have population-level impacts and, furthermore, can mitigate the impact of exogenous drivers (e.g. rainfall) in species whose reproduction depends upon it. Once frontline interventions have suppressed mosquito densities, attempts to eliminate malaria with supplementary vector control tools may be attenuated by increased population growth and individual fitness.

AB  - Environmental effects on population growth are often quantified by coupling environmental covariates with population time series, using statistical models that make particular assumptions about the shape of density dependence. We hypothesized that faulty assumptions about the shape of density dependence can bias estimated effect sizes of temporally autocorrelated covariates. We investigated the presence of bias using Monte Carlo simulations based on three common per capita growth functions with distinct density dependent forms (θ-Ricker, Ricker and Gompertz), autocorrelated (coloured) ‘known’ environmental covariates and uncorrelated (white) ‘unknown’ noise. Faulty assumptions about the shape of density dependence, combined with overcompensatory intrinsic population dynamics, can lead to strongly biased estimated effects of coloured covariates, associated with lower confidence interval coverage. Effects of negatively autocorrelated (blue) environmental covariates are overestimated, while those of positively autocorrelated (red) covariates can be underestimated, generally to a lesser extent. Prewhitening the focal environmental covariate effectively reduces the bias, at the expense of the estimate precision. Fitting models with flexible shapes of density dependence can also reduce bias, but increases model complexity and potentially introduces other problems of parameter identifiability. Model selection is a good option if an appropriate model is included in the set of candidate models. Under the specific and identifiable circumstances with high risk of bias, we recommend prewhitening or careful modelling of the shape of density dependence.

AB  - This study looks at the relationship between the size of the small interacting group (in numbers of persons) and its environment in this case, the density of its immediate population. We hypothesized that persons in more densely populated areas will gather for social interaction in smaller groups, in fewer bisexual groups. As density increases, males will tend to gathes in smaller groups than females. The sample for this study was drawn from three university campuses with varying population density (University of Texas at Austin, Southwest Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas, and Saint Edward's University, Austin, Texas-in order of decreasing density). The number and sex of persons making up interacting groups during the lunch break in the respective cafeterias of these universities was tallied and a typical (average) size group was computed for each university. All hypotheses were supported, indicating a significant inverse relationship between population density and the size of small interacting groups.

AB  - Fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) populations in the southeastern United States are declining, with fragmentation of large mature forests believed to be the primary cause. Historically, demographics of midwestern fox squirrel or gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) populations have been applied to management of southeastern fox squirrels. However, fox squirrels rarely become abundant in southeastern forests, despite variations in habitat quality. Previous research has reported on low density populations in the Southeast, but the effects of changing land use patterns on population demographics remain untested. We studied the demographics of a stable high density population of southern fox squirrels (S. n. niger) on Spring Island, South Carolina. Squirrel density (75.8 squirrels/km(2)), as estimated by the mark-resight method was the highest reported for fox squirrels in the Southeast. Mean annual survival rate was 62%, with automobiles causing 31% of squirrel deaths. Seasonal weights (992 g-1150 g), age structure (39% juvenile and 61% subadult or adult) and evidence of year round breeding suggest the population was healthy despite concurrent residential development of the island. Although individual home ranges were smaller (2.13 ha for females during late summer to 15.08 ha for males during early summer) than previously reported, we observed no resource related sexual segregation or intolerance among individuals. We believed the characteristics of this unique population were directly related to the sustainable availability of a diversity of fox squirrel foods. These findings suggest that population demographics of fox squirrels might differ greatly among habitats, even within similar geographic locations and the same subspecies. Therefore, managers should recognize that southern fox squirrel populations can thrive in forests with residential development when cover and food resources are abundant and sustainable.

AB  - Population size and trends of large low-density predators, like lions (Panthera leo), are difficult to monitor, a situation that is exacerbated in a semi-arid and vast area like the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP, 36000 km), South Africa/Botswana, where they occur at low densities. Mark-resighting studies conducted in 1976, and again in 1996, in the lower rainfall south African region of this transfrontier park (former Kalahari Gemsbok National Park) and adjoining area in the former Gemsbok National Park, Botswana 3000km) indicated that lions occurred at very low densities (< lion/100km). For affective conservation of lions in the KTP, and to evaluate the effect of persistent but low intensity boundary persecution, reliable estimates of population size and trends were required. Furthermore the adjoining area in the former GNP had never been surveyed (+ 23000 km). By adapting a technique whereby the correlation between spoor density (an indirect measure), and true density in various representative study areas, it was possible to extrapolate a density estimate for the entire park. True densities were determined by acquiring thorough knowledge of the population in each study area. This was done through a combination of marking individuals, radio-telemetry, ground observations, and attracting lions to call up stations. Spoor density was determined through intensive spoor transects, conducted within the study areas (1382+215 km/study area). A total of 4078 km were conducted for comparative purposes outside the study areas.

AB  - Recent research has emphasized path-dependence and the effect of vintage factors in urban development, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are cities where the modern CBD is not in its historic location. Distance from the historic center is taken as a proxy of housing and infrastructure vintage. A polycentric urban population density function is used to assess the.relative importance of distance from the CBD and from the historic center in explaining population density. Additionally, I examine econometrically the validity of a number of population density functions, and analyze the structure of the error variance and the design of appropriate measures of goodness of fit and hypothesis tests for regression models of population density. The results show that distance from the historical center is an important factor in explaining population density but its explanatory power has declined over time. It is more significant than distance from the CBD in explaining residential density in Tel Aviv and gross density in Jerusalem. It explains a larger proportion of the variance in gross density in the inner city than does distance from the CBD, but vice versa in the suburbs.

AB  - This paper describes the methodology used to produce estimates of the population by ethnic group for local authorities in England and Wales. The approach used is a cohort component methodology with population counts, and each component of population change, constrained to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) national and local authority mid-year population estimates. Consideration is given to the modelling of the ethnic dimension of mortality; fertility (and the allocation of ethnic group to infants); switching between ethnic group categories; and the various aspects of migration, with particular attention given to the application of commissioned Census data. The methodology described is that used for Release 8 of the estimates published in May 2011. The methodology has changed very little since the publication of the first set of estimates in 2006. The paper consists of two parts. The first provides a description of the methodology. The second provides guidance on using the estimates in an informed way.

AB  - Badgers are facultatively social, forming large groups at high density. Group-living appears to have high reproductive costs for females, and may lead to increased levels of inbreeding. The extent of female competition for reproduction has been estimated from field data, but knowledge of male reproductive success and the extent of extra-group paternity remains limited. Combining field data with genetic data (16 microsatellite loci), we studied the mating system of 10 badger social groups across 14 years in a high-density population. From 923 badgers, including 425 cubs, we were able to assign maternity to 307 cubs, with both parents assigned to 199 cubs (47%) with 80% confidence, and 14% with 95% confidence. Age had a significant effect on the probability of reproduction, seemingly as a result of a deficit of individuals aged two years and greater than eight years attaining parentage. We estimate that approximately 30% of the female population successfully reproduced in any given year, with a similar proportion of the male population gaining paternity across the same area. While it was known there was a cost to female reproduction in high density populations, it appears that males suffer similar, but not greater, costs. Roughly half of assigned paternity was attributed to extra-group males, the majority of which were from neighbouring social groups. Few successful matings occurred between individuals born in the same social group (22%). The high rate of extra-group mating, previously unquantified, may help reduce inbreeding, potentially making philopatry a less costly strategy.

AB  - Pregnancy costs the lives of half a million women every year—the equivalent of one woman dying every minute. Most of these deaths are avoidable, but how best to avoid them is a subject of debate among public health professionals. The debate turns on the question of whether or not maternal mortality rates can be reduced using the method that was so effective in lowering child mortality rates: an approach focusing on the provision of inexpensive, preventive health measures. Proponents of this strategy say that providing basic prenatal health care to pregnant women, and training traditional birth attendants to recognize serious labor and delivery complications, can go a long way toward preventing maternal mortality. Others argue that, while such services can improve women's health, they will not lower maternal mortality rates because the major causes of maternal deaths—emergency obstetric conditions—are not preventable. Nor are they predictable: "Some of the women in the so-called low-risk group will experience serious complications and . . . some (in many cases, most) of the women in the high-risk group will not. In many instances, most of the problems arise among women in the low-risk group," concludes a Population Council report, titled "A reassessment of the concept of reproductive risk in maternity care and family planning services." Given these facts, some public health professionals contend that the only effective way to reduce maternal mortality rates is to improve the management of emergency obstetric conditions in developing countries, where 99 percent of maternal deaths occur.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to composting of organic waste and the use of compost were assessed from a waste management perspective. The GHG accounting for composting includes use of electricity and fuels, emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from the composting process, and savings obtained by the use of the compost. The GHG account depends on waste type and composition (kitchen organics, garden waste), technology type (open systems, closed systems, home composting), the efficiency of off-gas cleaning at enclosed composting systems, and the use of the compost. The latter is an important issue and is related to the long-term binding of carbon in the soil, to related effects in terms of soil improvement and to what the compost substitutes; this could be fertilizer and peat for soil improvement or for growth media production. The overall global warming factor (GWF) for composting therefore varies between significant savings (900 kg CO2-equivalents tonne1 wet waste (ww)) and a net load (300 kg CO2-equivalents tonne 1 ww). The major savings are obtained by use of compost as a substitute for peat in the production of growth media. However, it may be difficult for a specific composting plant to document how the compost is used and what it actually substitutes for. Two cases representing various technologies were assessed showing how GHG accounting can be done when specific information and data are available.

AB  - Turbulent reaction rate closure modelling using the concept of Flame Surface Density (FSD) is now well-established in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations. In the present study, three-dimensional DNS data is explicitly filtered in order to evaluate different terms of the FSD transport equation in the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Existing sub-models for these unclosed terms are assessed with respect to the filtered DNS data, resulting in a recommended modelled form for each term. Previously assessed modelling of the propagation and curvature terms is combined with new model formulations for the turbulent transport and strain rate terms to produce a complete modelled FSD transport equation for use in LES. Displacement speed is shown to play a pivotal role in the modelling of several terms and its curvature dependence is explicitly accounted for in order to ensure that the FSD model will be valid in both the corrugated flamelets and the thin reaction zones regimes.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Radiotherapy and radiology have been indispensable components in cancer care for many years. The detection limit of small tumor foci as well as the development of radio-resistance and severe side effects towards normal tissues led to the development of strategies to improve radio-diagnostic and -therapeutic approaches by pharmaceuticals. The term radiopharmaceutical has been used for drugs labeled with radioactive tracers for therapy or diagnosis. In addition, drugs have been described to sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy (radiosensitizers) or to protect normal tissues from detrimental effects of radiation (radioprotectors). The present review summarizes recent concepts on the transport of radiopharmaceuticals, radiosensitizers, and radioprotectors in cells and tissues, e.g. by ATP-binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein. Strengths and weaknesses of current strategies to improve transport-based processes are discussed.

AB  - The Earth's surface has changed considerably over the past centuries. Since the start of the industrial Revolution in the early 1700s, humans from the "Old World" started to colonize the "New World". The colonization processes lead to major changes in global land use and land cover. Large parts of the original land cover have been altered (e.g., deforestation), leading to extra emissions of GHG's to the atmosphere and enhancing global climate change. The spatial and temporal aspects are still not very well known. More and more global integrated environmental assessments concerning global sustainability require long time series of global change indicators, of which population is an important one. This study presents an update of the geo-referenced historical population maps for the period 1700-2000, part of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE), which can be used in integrated models of global change and/or global sustainability.

AB  - Globally, new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis total 340 million each year. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are major causes of severe illness, infertility, obstetric complications, and infant illness. They may also increase transmission of HIV. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are 50 to 300 percent more prevalent among women than among men. Correctly diagnosing and treating RTIs in women is thus a public health imperative. However, reaching this goal usually requires a clinic visit and a pelvic examination, which may deter some women. Population Council researchers investigated the acceptability and feasibility of home-based self-sampling for STIs in Brazil and South Africa. In South Africa, researchers also looked at the validity of using self-sampling in a clinic setting to diagnose RTIs.

For the insertion of the extra guard band, an efficient strategy based on self assessment is applied by the each victim cell individually and independently. Consequently, it is no more required to spread the extra guard band over the whole DSA region. Simulation results show improvement for both the considered UMTS and DVB-T networks.

AB  - In the Netherlands, a public transport monitoring system has been introduced to provide decision-makers and stakeholders the necessary management information. It has been designed primarily for the purposes of policy formulation and project development. It also serves as a source of information to inform the general public regarding the public transport situation in their region compared with other regions in the country . It is officially known as the OV-Monitor (Public Transport Monitor). It covers all form of public transport, except the railways which has it own Users'Surveys. OV-Monitor contains detailed information on the supply, usage, quality and the fares revenue of urban and regional public transport. The data is collected, collated and made available in the internet. The OV-Monitor covers the whole of the Netherlands which is currently comprised of 74 concession regions. For each region, information is available on aspects such as modal split, passenger-kilometres, frequency of services, possibilities to link-up with connecting bus services and the reactions of the users. The last aspects is the primary subject of this paper. However, the paper will in its introduction give the background information leading to its introduction, the objectives of the project, its set-up and usage. Catering for the travelling needs of the general public has been the main theme in the planning philosophy in the Netherlands. In the public transport sector, it has generally been recognised that the existing and potential passengers are the clients and public transport services should be tailor-made to serve their requirements. To this end, the OV-Monitor has been constructed to assist officials from the transport authority and the operators. An important component of the system is the Customers'Survey Study. The research information serves as a kind of barometer to give insights into two important questions:Which aspect of the public transport services are important to the customers and how satisfied are the customers with respect tro each of the quality aspect. A large scale questionairre survey is undertaken once every year in the 74 concession regions. The transport authorities at the national and local levels together with the operators have (on the basis of earlier research findings)together identified 32 quality aspects as important. These quality aspects have been grouped together into a consistent and cohesive set of indicators covering information, security, comfort. travel time. journey costs and facilities available. For each aspect, the passenger was invited to give a score using a 10 points scale. The system is now in use and has been introduced since 2001. The paper will describe the methodology used, the quality of the results and illustrate how the findings are being used to support decision making and the benchmarking of performances between concession regions and performance over time.

AB  - Malawi is one of 15 population and climate change hotspots characterized by a high population growth rate, a high projected decline in agricultural production, and low resilience to climate change.1 In addition, Malawi faces severe water scarcity. The combined effects of climate change and rapid population growth are increasing food insecurity, environmental degradation and poverty levels in Malawi. Addressing population growth and climate change together should be a top development priority for Malawi. Though the two issues are not strongly linked in current policies, the inclusion of both in the 2011-2016 Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) presents an opportunity to improve the well- being of Malawians. This positive step needs to be supported with improved policies, better coordination and adequate financial and human resources to ensure effective implementation of programs. Unless population dynamics are included as part of overall development strategies, more Malawians will be vulnerable to serious impacts of climate change.

Measures of household and family contact were found to be significantly correlated to four rates of hospital utilization. These same measures carried unique components that were also significantly related to service use. Other measures of density such as people per acre and structures per acre were found to be unrelated to the rates of psychiatric utilization. The results of this study suggest that if density does produce mental illness its likely mechanism of action will be routed through household contact.

By using a small window data from traditional Indian society it was observed that frequency of intercourse is relatively low in this traditional society where coital life is largely dictated by religious structures and social taboos.  This finding suggests that a relatively conservative attitude towards sexual activity persist within the specified population.  In addition logistic regression analysis identified covariates that are important predictors for coital frequency.  Covariates such as susceptibility condition of wife age of wife age of husband couples marital duration sub-caste per capita monthly income of the household number of male surviving children and total number of surviving children have strong effects on the risk of sexual intercourse.  In conclusion fertility can be controlled through the use of a male method of contraception in this society where the frequency of coitus is very low but unprotected.  More qualitative research is essential to understand the low coital frequency in this traditional society and hence its correlates.

AB  - UNITED NATIONS, New York – Twenty years ago, the international community gathered in Cairo, Egypt, to explore how the world was changing and how those changes were affecting the most vulnerable. At the 1994 meeting, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the world agreed that population issues – including voluntary family planning, maternal and child health, migration, and gender equality – are not just about counting people, but about making sure that every person counts. At the conference, 179 governments signed on to the ICPD Programme of Action, which recognizes that women, their rights and equality are global development priorities. The governments committed to: providing universal access to voluntary family planning, sexual and reproductive health services and rights; delivering gender equality and equal access to education; addressing the impacts of urbanization and migration; and supporting sustainable development. Today, the world is very different, transformed by the digital revolution and advances in medicine and human knowledge. But has it changed in the ways we hoped it would?

AB  - The 1998 world population of 5.9 billion is projected to reach 9.4 billion by 2050. However, the difference of 1 child per couple now can make a difference of 23 billion in the world population size projections for 2150. The projections are also affected by when couples decide to begin bearing children; raising the mother's age at first birth from 18 to 23 years would reduce population momentum by more than 40%. Unintended pregnancy early in life is usually the result of lack of access to information and services, unwanted sexual relations, unprotected sex, or the ineffective use of contraception. Research throughout the world has shown that providing integrated primary health services, rather than separate services for different health concerns, is the most effective and cost-efficient way to meet the multiple needs of adolescents, including their needs related to sexual and reproductive health.

AB  - The environmental and natural resource problems that afflict most countries of the Asian and Pacific region are caused by human activities, often arising from the needs of growing populations for land to cultivate subsistence crops. These include the farming of marginal land; insufficient fallow periods; the clearing of forest land for agriculture and the felling of trees for firewood and timber. Water pollution, air pollution, deforestation and desertification are related to human activities. One of the priorities for population and development planning in the region will be action-oriented research into the linkages, to guide national and regional development policies. Both population and environmental concerns must be integrated into social and economic development plans in order for development to be sustainable. To achieve these goals, rapid population growth must be slowed and eventually stabilized, while strategies on optimal population distribution should be formulated. Concomitantly, environmental conditions must be maintained or improved through reversing deforestation and erosion in major watersheds; checking the spread of deserts; introducing sustainable water management; reducing acidification and hazardous waste; developing and introducing environmentally safe industrial processes; eliminating hunger through sustainable agriculture; finding new and renewable sources of energy and increasing energy efficiency; and protecting animal and plant species and preventing further loss. To avoid the possible negative consequences, balanced development in an integrated fashion is called for. As far as environmental problems are concerned, there is a growing need for the planning mechanism to take demographic variables into account in a more integrated way than has been done in the past. For purposes of environmental and population planning, a longer-term approach should be taken in addition to the five-year plans.

AB  - With decreased illegal hunting and better habitat conservation, the Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) population grew from an estimated 25-50 animals in the late 1940s to approximately 200 animals on Big Pine and No Name keys, Florida, USA, by 1971, the last official survey. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) trend data indicate that the deer population continued to increase after 1971; however, current deer density estimates are necessary for the proposed reclassification of the Key deer from endangered to threatened. Our study objectives were to (1) obtain current population estimates of Florida Key deer and compare these to historical estimates, (2) evaluate survey methods (USFWS mortality and deer counts) in detecting changes in population trends, and (3) outline a protocol for future monitoring. Road counts (n = 889) were conducted from January 1971 to December 1971 and January 1976 to December 2001 on Big Pine and No Name keys. From mark-recapture data, we estimated that the Key deer population on these 2 islands increased by 240% between 1971 and 2001 (2001 estimate: 453-517 deer). Trend data indicated that annual deer mortality was a function of deer density or population size (r(s) = 0.743). We compared the annual finite rate of increase (R) from USFWS annual deer counts and mortality data (R = 1.053-1.065) to mark-recapture studies (R = 1.038) and found them to be similar (P = 0.66-0.67). This similarity suggests that all 3 methods (USFWS deer counts and mortality data, and mark-recapture data) can be used to monitor changes in Key deer density.

We found it to be theoretically incorrect, not supported by empirical data on maximum population density and body size relationships, and that its calculation is misleading. In particular, we found a general pattern underlying the allometry of maximum population density, which stresses the correspondence between the docu- mented linear patterns and triangular relationships between both variables. 3. Two independent data sets, one for mammals and another for intertidal invert- ebrates, showed that medium-size species attain higher population densities, and that population density decreases towards larger and smaller sizes. 4. A more direct calculation of population energy use for mammalian primary con- sumers, based on measured metabolic rates, showed that populations' energy use fluctuates widely among species and that its upper limit is not independent of body size but peaks at a body size of about 100 g, and decreases toward both smaller and larger body sizes. 5. Diet also has a strong effect on this relationship. Omnivores show a positive relationship between population energy use and body size, while this is negative for carnivores and insectivores.

AB  - In studying the complex determinants of human fertility, social scien- tists have given little attention to population density, although reproduction has been shown to be density-dependent for a wide variety of other species. Using fixed effects models on the time series of 145 countries and controlling for key social and economic variables, we find a consistent and significant negative relationship be- tween human fertility and population density. Moreover, we find that individual fertility preferences also decline with population density. These findings suggest that population density should be included as a variable in future studies of fertility determinants.

With the approach this autumn of the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, organized by the United Nations, these divisions among experts are receiving enormous attention and generating considerable heat. There is a danger that in the confrontation between apocalyptic pessimism, on the one hand, and a dismissive smugness, on the other, a genuine understanding of the nature of the population problem may be lost.[1]

While the U.S. population grew by 36 percent between 1980 and 2009, the Latino population more than tripled, increasing from 14.6 million to nearly 48.4 million.1 Latinos accounted for slightly more than 40 percent of the roughly 81 million people added to the U.S. population over the past 30 years. The influence of the Latino population will only grow in coming decades, and mostly through natural increase, not immigration.

AB  - Many habitat fragmentation experiments make the prediction that animal population density will be positively related to fragment, or patch, size. The mechanism that is supposed to result in this prediction is unclear, but several recent reviews have demonstrated that population density often is negatively related to patch size. Immigration behavior is likely to have an important effect on population density for species that do not show strong edge effects, for species that have low emigration rates, and during short-term habitat fragmentation experiments. We consider the effect that different kinds of immigration behaviors will have on population density and we demonstrate that only a minority of possible scenarios produce positive density vs. patch size relationships. More commonly, these relationships are expected to be negative. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering autecological mechanisms, such as immigration behavior, when developing the predictions that we test in habitat fragmentation or other experiments.

AB  - Previous studies have discussed the evolution of ownership using the Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game. Decisive parameters are resource values (V) and contest costs (C). However, ownership may also evolve as a result of the effects of population density. To compare the effects of population density with those of resource values, I created a learning-based model of a revised Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game. The game simulates the dynamics of agents that struggle for regions ("territories") along a line. With appropriate sets of r (resource value) and l (reciprocal of the population density), the model showed that ownership is more likely to evolve when the resource value is small and population density is high. An area containing high-value resources is likely to accompany high population density. However, simulations showed that population density has stronger effects than resource value on the evolution of ownership.

AB  - Accounting for the variation in the population density among different animal species is a central goal of animal ecology (Andrewartha and Birch 1954). Among mammals, density is closely related to the average adult body mass of the species and to the trophic level occupied by the species (Mohr 1940; Clutton-Brock and Harvey 1977; Eisenberg 1980; Damuth 1981a; Peters 1983; Peters and Raelson 1984). In addition, after the body mass and trophic position of species have been taken into account, population densities appear to vary with habitat (Eisenberg 1980) and biogeographical area (Peters and Raelson 1984). Peters and Raelson have been impressed by the predictive power of these relations: "Because these relations appear so powerful . . . they should be examined as fully as possible before they come into widespread use" (1984, p. 499).

AB  - The study area for this investigation was in the Cotswold escarpment region of Gloucestershire. Twenty-one social groups of badgers occupied an area of 7.2 km2. An annual capture-recapture programme from 1977 to 1985 provided data for the study of the dynamics of this population of badgers. The total number of adult badgers present did not vary greatly, ranging from 75 in 1980 to 103 in 1982 and 1983. This represented a density of between 10.4 and 14.3 adult badgers per km2. The number of adult badgers present in individual social groups showed a greater variation than the population as a whole. An estimated average of 59% of cubs died in their first year of life. In the adult population males exhibited a higher annual mortality rate (average 34.6%) than females (average 24.0%), which resulted in an adult sex ratio biased towards females. The number of cubs caught each year was inversely proportional to the number of adults caught. Data on the lifespan of individual badgers of known age showed that very few animals exceeded the age of six years. There was evidence that females which bred had a lower expected survival rate than females which did not breed. The proportion of females which bred was higher in the four-to seven-year-old age classes than in the two- to three-year-old age classes. A single one-year-old female was observed to be lactating, providing evidence that occasionally females may breed in their first year. Breeding females showed a higher body weight than non-breeding females in the quarter October-December, which is prior to the main gestation period, and lower body weights in the quarter April-June, which corresponds to the lactation period.

A major shortcoming of almost all procedures is that they utdize only one observation for each urban area in the sample. Considering the limited number of urban areas in each sample the estimates derived based on these procedures are ineffkient. This paper proposes a further procedure which utilizes all the available observations on densities thereby leading to more effkient estimates. Confirmation of our basic hypotheses is achieved appiying the procedure to data from cities in Israel. 1.

AB  - In the past, many family planning and population organizations have paid relatively little attention to black fears of birth control coercion and to the writings, speeches, and attitudes that have resulted. Nor have they considered the history and reasons for black sensitivity on the subject of planned family size. This bulletin puts some of these issues and concepts into context within the American scene. It explores the present spectrum of opinion among black leaders and the cultural and political backgrounds that have influenced current thought. The responses of blacks in putting family planning into practice are also outlined, together with some probable trends in family size. It is concluded that, at present, black women are more influenced in the practice of rejection of family planning methods by the practical considerations of bearing and raising children than by any abstract political and philosophical questions on either side. But, some black men may look at issues differently. A New England study indicates that black males under 30 are both more likely to concur with the genocide-conspiracy theory and be more hesitant about condoning the limitation of black family size than are older black males.

AB  - Marine fisheries management is a complex process incorporating fisheries biology and stock status information, food web and predator/prey relationships, habitat needs, socioeconomic needs of recreational and commercial fishermen, and law enforcement issues. Understanding how all of these factors interact is a challenging task, even for experts in fisheries science and management. The purpose of this document is to explain the fisheries biology and stock status parts of the equation. It is intended for fishermen and other stakeholders interested in fisheries management issues, and serves as a primer for the technical basis of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s decision-making process. The following pages provide an overview of fisheries population dynamics (Chapter 1), fundamental data sources for fisheries stock assessments (Chapter 2), fish biology and life history information (Chapter 3), stock assessment concepts and principles (Chapter 4), common stock assessment models (Chapter 5), biological reference points and their use in gauging stock health and the effectiveness of management measures (Chapter 6), and how these elements fit into the Commission’s fisheries management process (Chapter 7). The guide closes with a glossary of common fisheries language, including all terms in bold text found throughout the document. This publication explains some technical aspects of stock assessments that may be unfamiliar to those not directly involved in fisheries science and the analysis of fish populations. In particular, it is designed for stakeholders involved in Commission activities that have never been exposed to formal fisheries science training, but are asked to comprehend and interpret complicated fisheries concepts. An enhanced knowledge of fisheries science and assessment concepts will promote a better understanding of fisheries management, will promote more informed decision making, and will give stakeholders greater confidence in their significant role in the management process.

AB  - On 13 September 1994 in Cairo, after nine days of intense debate,\nthe International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)\nadopted a wide-ranging 20-year action plan that delegates and commentators\nhailed as opening a “new era in population”.\n\n\nUnderpinned by a commitment to human rights and gender equality, the\nCairo agreement called on countries to ensure reproductive health\nand rights for all as a critical contribution to sustainable development\nand the fight against poverty, which the ICPD saw as inseparable\nfrom addressing population concerns.\n\n\n“You have crafted a Programme of Action for the next 20 years, which\nstarts from the reality of the world we live in, and shows us a path\nto a better reality,” Dr. Nafis Sadik, UNFPA Executive Director and\nSecretary-General of the conference, told delegates at the closing\nsession. “The Programme contains highly specific goals and recommendations\nin the mutually reinforcing areas of infant and maternal mortality,\neducation, and reproductive health and family planning, but its effect\nwill be far widerranging than that. This Programme of Action has\nthe potential to the change the world.”\n\n\nTen years into the new era, it is time to take stock:\n\n\n* The ICPD Programme of Action provides a blueprint for actions in\npopulation and reproductive health that countries agree are essential\nto realizing global development goals including ending extreme poverty\nand hunger, empowering women, reducing maternal mortality, preserving\nthe environment and stemming the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In recent regional\nand global meetings and in practice, governments have strongly reaffirmed\ntheir commitment, based on experience, to utilize the Programme of\nAction as an indispensable strategy for improving people’s well-being\nand ensuring human rights.\n\n\n\n* Many developing countries have made great strides in putting the\nICPD’s recommendations into action, with a significant impact. Countries\nare working to integrate population factors with development plans,\nimprove the quality and reach of reproductive health programmes,\npromote women’s rights, meet the needs of young people and those\nin emergency situations, and strengthen HIV prevention efforts. Access\nto family planning continues to grow; 60 per cent of married couples\nin developing countries now use modern methods of contraception,\ncompared to 10-15 per cent in 1960.\n\n\n\n* Inadequate resources and persistent gaps in serving the poorest\npopulations are impeding progress, however, in meeting ongoing challenges\nincluding the continued spread of HIV/AIDS, especially among the\nyoung, unmet need for family planning, and high fertility and maternal\nmortality in the least-developed countries. Donors need to meet the\ncommitments made in Cairo and give due priority to reproductive health\nin anti-poverty development assistance plans, and programmes must\nbe scaled up and extended to realize the ICPD’s goal of comprehensive\nreproductive health care for all by 2015.\n\n\nPutting People at the Centre\n\n\nAs its name implied, the ICPD was based on the premise that population\nsize, growth and distribution are closely linked to prospects for\neconomic and social development, and that actions in one area reinforce\nactions in the other.\n\n\nThis premise had won increasing acceptance in the two decades since\nthe first World Population Conference in 1974, as population grew\nrapidly in developing regions and as more and more countries gained\nexperience with family planning programmes. By 1994, most developing\ncountries saw a need to address population concerns in order to promote\neconomic growth and improve people’s well-being.\n\nA WIDE MANDATE\n\n\nThe 1994 Conference was explicitly given a broader mandate on development\nissues than previous population conferences, reflecting the growing\nawareness that population, poverty, patterns of production and consumption\nand the environment are so closely interconnected that none of them\ncan be considered in isolation.\n\n—ICPD Programme of Action, para. 1.5\n\n\nA NEW APPROACH. But the Cairo conference radically changed the international\ncommunity’s approach to the interlinked challenges of population\nand development, putting human beings and human rights, rather than\npopulation numbers and growth rates, at the centre of the equation.\n\n\nAt the heart of this paradigm shift was the move away from a perception\nof population as essentially a macro-economic variable for planning\nand policy, to a rights-based approach in which the well-being of\nindividuals is key. The ICPD Programme of Action called for policies\nand programmes to take an integrated approach— linking population\naction to human development, women’s empowerment, gender equality,\nand the needs and rights of individuals, including young people.\n\n\nThe ICPD Programme of Action recognized that investing in people,\nin broadening their opportunities and enabling them to realize their\npotential as human beings, is the key to sustained economic growth\nand sustainable development, as well as to population levels that\nare in balance with the environment and available resources.\n\n\nAs part of this shift, the ICPD grounded family planning, once the\nmain focus of population policies and programmes, within a broader\nframework of reproductive health and rights, including family planning\nand sexual health. It recognized reproductive health as a human right\nfor all people throughout their life cycle, and urged countries to\nstrive for universal access to comprehensive reproductive health\nservices by 2015 (see Chapter 6).\n\n\nINDIVIDUAL CHOICE PROMOTES PROSPERITY. The ICPD consensus recognized\nthat enabling couples and individuals to freely determine the number,\ntiming and spacing of their children would speed progress towards\nsmaller families and slower population growth, contributing to economic\ngrowth and reducing poverty, at both the household and macro levels.\nConversely, it understood that not addressing needs and major gaps\nin reproductive health services would help perpetuate high fertility,\nhigh maternal mortality and rapid population growth, undermining\npoverty reduction prospects (see Chapter 2).\n\n\nWOMEN’S RIGHTS. Empowering women was recognized as an important end\nin itself, as well as a key to improving the quality of life of everyone.\nWithout the full and equal participation of women, there can be no\nsustainable human development. The Programme of Action stressed the\nimportance of reproductive rights to women’s autonomy, as a complement\nto education, economic empowerment and political participation (see\nChapter 5).\n\n\nImportant breakthroughs were made in facing up to urgent but sensitive\nchallenges including adolescents’ sexual health, HIV/AIDS and unsafe\nabortion. Unprecedented attention was given to underserved groups,\nincluding the rural poor, indigenous peoples, urban slum dwellers,\nand refugees and internally displaced people.\n\n\nPARTICIPATION AND PARTNERSHIP. The Cairo agreement also envisioned\na participatory and accountable development process, actively involving\nbeneficiaries to ensure that programmes and policy goals are linked\nwith personal realities, and to building broad partnerships between\ngovernments, international organizations and civil society.

AB  - Montserrat, a small Caribbean island, has maintained a relatively stable population size for the past 95 years. The size of the population between 1891 and 1986 (except for 1946) has been around 12,000. Such stability is rare, especially for a developing society. This stability is in no small way due to the net migration loss. Indirectly also, emigration has suppressed fertility, aged the population and increased the crude death rate. Montserrat's relatively high quality of life is in part a consequence of this relative stability in the size of the population over the last one hundred years.

AB  - With the purpose of obtaining a theoretical basis on which existing experimental data on the density effect upon reproduction may be interpreted consistently, a mathematical analysis has been developed from the well-known logistic growth equation.  consideration has first been given to the growth process occurring in the interval of one generation time, resulting in mathematical relations for the effects of initial population density No on (1) the apparent rate of reproduction, R, and (2) the total number of living individuals, P, to be found at the end of the generation.  These are given in equations (4) and (7), respectively.  Experimental checks on these equations have been made, using the data which had been presented by Utida (1941a) on an experimental population of the azuki bean weevil, although data from some other insect populations have also been used to confirm equation (4).  Satisfactory agreements of these equations with the corresponding experimental data are shown graphically in Figures 2, 3, 3, and 4.  One of the interesting facts thereby revealed is the clear evidence of a density of parent population at which the total population reaches a maximum value.  Experimental proof of the existence of such an optimum density in population growth had previously been given by the populations of several insect species, but its theoretical foundation has remained obscure.  Next, equation (7) has been modified to give a mathematical relation for describing the population changes from generation to generation.  This relation is given in equation (10).  By solving this analytically, if possible, or numerically, it has been shown that, theoretically, population changes in successive generations should follow one of the various modes indicated in Table I.  Some experimental data that meet this theoretical requirement have been mentioned.  Finally, employing a relation which has recently been derived by Fujita between the volume of environment and the Pearl-Verhulst coefficient, the logistic equation (3) has bene transformed into equation (18), and it has been demonstrated that this equation is also well fitted by the experimental data on the azuki bean weevil population (Utida 1942), in which the density effect on reproduction was studied by changing the volume of the container.  The agreements thus obtained are found in Figures 7 and 8.

AB  - This study investigates the correlation between land cover data and other factors that affect population distribution. The results show that land cover data contain sufficient information to infer population distribution and can be used independently to model the spatial pattern of population density in China. China’s population distribution model (CPDM) was developed based on land cover data to calculate population density in China at 1 km resolution. For cells in rural areas, population probability coefficients were calculated based on weighted linear models, the weights of land cover types being derived from multivariate regression models and on a qualitative order of land types in 12 agro-ecological zones. For cells in urban areas, a power exponential decay model based on city size and the distance from urban center was employed to calculate population probability coefficients. The models were validated in sampled cells using ancillary population data. The validation shows the mean relative error of estimated population to be 3.13 and 5.26% in rural and urban areas, respectively. Compared to existing models, the accuracy of CPDM is much higher at cell, county and province scales.

This growth, which is unprecedented in history, has been and still is, continuously accelerating. Despite unusually low birth rates in the 1930's and severe war losses in the 1940's, world population grew, on an average, by about 1 per cent per• annum in every decade since 1920. By 1980, the earth will probably have between 3,300 and 4,000 million inhabitants. Large migrations to• previously sparsely settled continents caused unusually rapid growth in Northern America and Oceania during the past century. The relative importance of migration will be much less in the future. In Europe, population growth was rapid because of declining mortality, but is slowing down because of lowered fertility. The populations of Northern America, Japan, and the Soviet Union will probably follow a similar trend. In Asia, mortality has only begun to decline and will cause an acceleration of population growth. Most rapid growth must be expected in Latin America where birth rates are very high and death rates are already fairly low. Because of insufficient statistics, past and future trends in China and parts of Africa are difficult to determine

In this article it is argued that the exponent within the function can be biassed by the misidentification of the CBD and of the centroids of census tracts. Using a least-squares method it is shown that such misspecification (of the location of the CBD) leads to an underestimation of the gradient, and shows that the magnitude of the bias is itself related to the extent of the distance error by which the CBD is misidentified.

Our findings show that migrants are primarily involved in economic transnational activities, such as sending financial remittances, and investing in land, business and properties in the home country. This affects their everyday life in the USA by limiting their financial resources, which has an effect on their living conditions and spending patterns. Migrants also engage in social transnational activities which involve maintaining social contacts with friends and family abroad, socializing with people from the same ethnic group, and home visits. Cultural transnational activities that migrants are involved in are primarily low cost, individual in nature, and home based. Only those more established in the local ethnic communities are involved in structured social and cultural transnational activities with the host country focus. The study highlights the interdependency of economic, social and cultural aspects of transnational activities and shows a temporal progression of different aspects of transnationalism among people at different stages of their migration career.

AB  - The diversity of neo-tropical primates is represented by 128 species, with 26 threatened species, 24 of which are endemic of Brazil. Of these threatened primates, 15 species occur in the Atlantic Forest, indicating an alarming state of conservation due to anthropogenic factors. Mata do Para so, the largest fragment of this biome in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, comprises an area of 384.5 ha, whose primate population is represented by Callicebus nigrifrons (Spix, 1823), known by titi monkey, and Callithrix sp., denominated marmosets. The present study aimed at estimating the density and population size of these species, as well as at determining their abundance in the area. Five linear 1 km transects, placed in a parallel fashion in a representative portion of the forest, were covered by following the premises of the methodology Distance for linear transects. The data were collected from August 2004 to February 2006, with 70 samplings, totaling 82.7km being sampled, with 24 primate detections. A density of 4.51 groups/km(2) for Callicebus nigrifrons and 7.45 groups/km(2) for Callithrix sp was obtained. Callicebus nigrifrons' abundance corresponded to 1.43 individuals/10 km sampled, and the abundance of Callithrix sp. corresponded to 1.17 individuals/10 km sampled. The population size of Callicebus nigrifrons was estimated in 28 individuals and for Callithrix sp., in 86 individuals. This result corroborates the need for further research to detect fluctuations along time, aiming to preserve and manage these species.

AB  - A computational model of multi-scale population densities was developed based on the native population database of Shijiazhuang city. The model comprises four parts: data processing, down-scaling, data format conversion and up-scaling. Down-scaling was completed by apportioning village population to each street block. The vector dataset of block population was converted into 100m&#x00D7;100m grid dataset, which is the minimum grain population density. By changing the radius of circular filter factor, the up-scaling of population density was realized and the multi-scale population density was obtained. The results show that the long-term balance of human and nature environment can be clearly revealed on the maps of population densities at R &#x003D; 0, R &#x003D;3, R &#x003D;12, R &#x003D;29 and R &#x003D;99. The model is helpful to observe the interaction of man-land relationship at different scales systematically, and to build a mathematical foundation for studying the MAUP (The Modifiable Area Unit Problem) of population density.

AB  - Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, highly fatal disorder of uncontrolled inflammation, usually affecting infants. Significant progress in the treatment of this disorder has been achieved during the last decade, and outcomes for larger series of patients have been reported in recent years. Although medical therapy has advanced, hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the only curative therapy for patients with the familial form of this disorder. Unfortunately, these patients have demonstrated relatively poor post-transplant outcomes for a nonmalignant disorder, with approximately 30% mortality in the first 100 days. Early deaths were attributable to infection, GVHD, and unusually high rates of primary nonengraftment, venoocclusive disease and pneumonitis. In addition, a significant number of deaths were due to HLH reactivation, a unique complication seen in this patient group. In contrast, late complications were relatively infrequent and essentially all patients with durable engraftment remained in remission indefinitely. In this review, we will discuss recent progress in the transplant management of patients with HLH and potential future strategies, including the use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens.

AB  - Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) is home to a low-density black bear (Ursus americanus)population that exists at >2,400m with a very limited growing season. A previous study (1984–1991) found bear densities among the lowest reported (1.37–1.52 bears/100 km2). Because of con- cerns of viability of this small population, we assessed popu- lation size and density of black bears from 2003 to 2006 to determine the current status of RMNP’s bear population.We used three approaches to estimate population size and density: (1) minimum number known, (2) occupancy modeling, and (3) catch per unit effort (CPUE). We used information from capture and remote-triggered cameras, as well as visitor infor- mation, to derive a minimum known population estimate of 20–24 individuals and a median density estimate of 1.35 bears/100 km2. Bear occupancy was estimated at 0.46 (SE0 0.11), with occupancy positively influenced by lodgepole pine stands, non-vegetated areas, and patch density but negatively influenced by mixed conifer stands. We combined the occu- pancy estimate with mean home-range size and overlap for bears in RMNP to derive a density estimate of 1.44 bears/ 100 km2.We also related CPUE to density estimates for eight low-density black bear populations to estimate density in RMNP; this estimate (1.03 bears/100 km2) was comparable to the occupancy estimate and suggests that this approach may be useful for future population monitoring. The use of corrob- orative techniques for assessing population size of a low- density black bear population was effective and should be considered for similar low-density wildlife populations.

AB  - Temporal variation in population size is regulated by both exogenous forces and density-dependent feedbacks. Furthermore, accumulating evidence indicates that temporal and spatial variation in climate and resources can modify the strength of density dependence in animal populations. We analyzed six long-term time series estimates of Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) abundance from Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, and Maine, USA, using the Kalman filter. Model-averaged estimates of the strength of delayed density dependence increased from west to east and from south to north. The strength of direct and delayed density dependence was positively related to the annual number of days with minimum temperature below -17.8Â&176;C. Annual population growth rates of P. leucopus at the Maine site were positively related to acorn abundance and P. leucopus populations tracked the changes in red-oak acorn abundance. The populations of P. leucopus living in northern latitudes might be more dependent on northern red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns for winter food than P. leucopus in southern latitudes. Furthermore, northern red oak trees mast every 4-5 years. Thus, longer, colder winters in northerly latitudes might result in stronger delayed density dependence in mouse populations with a shortage of winter food. Mice might simply track the acorn fluctuations in a delayed autocorrelated manner; however, delayed density dependence remained in our models for the Maine mouse populations after accounting for acorns, suggesting additional sources for delayed density dependence. Our results suggest that, in seed-eating Peromyscus, cyclicity may be regulated, in part, from low to high trophic levels.

AB  - When plotted along a gradient of population density, the mean group size in populations of several primate species has a unimodal distribution, i.e., mean group size is greater at intermediate population densities than at higher or lower population densities. In this study I present a mathematical model to clarify the cause of this relationship. Population density is assumed to affect group size by enhancing between- or within-group competition and by changing the number of neighboring groups around each group. The mean group size is predicted to decline as population density increases above a critical value, owing to the increasing number of neighboring groups

AB  - Temporal variability in population density has been shown to increase with increasing length of a study. This has serious implications for ecological studies and suggests that obtaining an objective measure of temporal variability may not be possible. To test this hypothesis more generally, I calculated inter annual variability, using the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual mean population density (STD(log D)), for 70 populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish which have been sampled over 10 to 51 consecutive yr in lakes around the world. STD(log D) fluctuates most widely during the first 3 6 yr of a study, but these changes do not necessarily represent long term trends in temporal variability. Median changes in STD(log D) over time are small (<< 0.l unit, even over a logarithmic time scale) and decrease as more years are included in the analysis. The inter annual variability of most freshwater populations appears to reach an asymptotic value. Several populations, however, show an alternation of plateaux and of sudden increases in STD(log D), suggesting that the asymptotic values found in most populations may be temporary and may not extrapolate beyond the temporal scale of this study (10 50 yr). Overall, the increases in inter annual variability are expected to be small(<0.l units, on average, per 25 yr). The pattern and the magnitude of these changes did not differ significantly between algae, zooplankton and fish, and were similar to those reported for birds and mammals. Increases in temporal variability may only be important for questions addressed over long periods of time.

AB  - A model is proposed with the following features: (1) there is a publicly accessible transport technology, which is more advanced when there is more specialized labor in it; (2) a high population density facilitates the development of the transport technology; (3) an improved transport technology facilitates a finer division of labor, which in turn increases per capita income. These features are compatible with the phenomena of economic development described by Boserup in 1981. It is also shown that, provided the infrastructure sector can charge the users, and individuals are free to choose jobs, the competitive equilibrium will be Paretooptimal.

AB  - This paper presents the 1st reasonably comprehensive survey of empirical research of urban population densities since the publication of the book by Edmonston in 1975.  The survey summarizes contributions to empirical knowledge that have been made since 1975 and points toward possible areas for additional research.  The paper also provides a brief interpretative intellectual history of the topic.  It begins with a personal overview of research in the field.  The next section discusses econometric issues that arise in the estimation of population density functions in which density is a function only of a distance to the central business district of the urban area.  Section 4 summarizes the studies of a single urban area that went beyond the estimation of simple distance-density functions, and Section 5 discusses studies that sought to explain the variations across urban areas in population density patterns.  McDonald refers to the standard theory of urban population density throughout the paper.  This basic model is presented in the textbook by Mills and Hamilton and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the model.

AB  - In 2010, some 214 million people — 3 per cent of the world's population — lived outside their country of origin. The magnitude and complexity of international migration makes it an important force in development and a high-priority issue for both developing and developed countries. The fact that about half of all migrants are women, most of reproductive age, is another reason this a pressing issue for UNFPA. Internal migration within countries is also on the rise, as people move in response to inequitable distribution of resources, services and opportunities, or to escape violence, natural disaster or the increasing number of extreme weather events. The movement of people from rural to urban areas has contributed to the explosive growth of cities around the globe. A relatively small percentage of migrants — about 10.5 million in 2011 — are refugees fleeing armed conflict, natural disaster, famine or persecution. But crises can displace large numbers of people over short time periods: Between December 2012 and January 2013, more than 255,000 Syrians fled the country. In a two year period, the conflict has displaced some 5 million people, 1 million of whom are registered as refugees in neighbouring countries.In times of crisis, UNFPA pays particular attention to the specific, often overlooked, needs of women and young people. Moving to work The majority of migrants cross borders in search of better economic and social opportunities. Economic migrants are the world's fastest growing group of migrants. Globalization has increased the mobility of labour, and a decline in fertility and working-age populations in many developed countries is leading to a rising demand for workers from abroad to sustain national economies. New patterns of migration have arisen, and many countries that once sent migrants abroad — for example, Argentina, Ireland and South Korea — are now experiencing migrant inflows as well. Several million people migrate without proper authorization each year, according to the International Organization for Migration. Such migrants often face dangerous journeys, exploitation by criminal smuggling networks, difficult working and living conditions, and intolerance when they arrive on foreign soil. Their irregular status often leaves them afraid to seek help when their rights are violated. Increased female migration One of the most significant changes in migration patterns in the last half century is that more women are migrating than ever before. Women now constitute half the international migrant population, and in some countries, as much as 70 or 80 per cent. As women migrants frequently end up in low-status, low-wage production and service jobs and often work in gender-segregated and unregulated sectors of the economy, such as domestic work, they are exposed to a much higher risk of exploitation, violence and abuse. Women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, a multimillion-dollar business. Trafficked women are exposed to sexual violence and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, yet they have little access to medical or legal services. Migration and development Migration is increasingly being perceived as a force that can contribute to development, and an integral aspect of the global development process. Migration considerations are being incorporated into broader planning policies, and will have an impact on the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and post 2015 development strategies. Migration is often temporary or circular, and many migrants maintain links with their home countries. While migrants make important contributions to the economic prosperity of their host countries, the flow of financial, technological, social and human capital back to their countries of origin also is having a significant impact on poverty reduction and economic development. Remittances from migrants are a major source of capital for developing countries. Remittance flows to developing countries are estimated to total $406 billion in 2012, an increase of 6.5 per cent over the previous year. Global remittance flows, including those to high-income countries, were an estimated $534 billion in 2012. Possibly twice this amount was transferred informally. These financial transfers are growing in significance. In many countries, they are larger than either development assistance or foreign direct investment. Available data show that women send home a higher proportion of their earnings than do men. These contributions feed and educate children and generally improve the living standards of loved ones left behind. Attention is being drawn to measures to counteract the negative effects of 'brain drain', to encourage migrants to invest in their countries of origin and bring their knowledge, skills and technical expertise to the development process. Migration and population growth High fertility and rapid population growth in some developing countries create pressures to emigrate by taxing infrastructures, education, health and social service systems and the environment. At the same time, migration has become an important component of population growth in countries where fertility has declined. In some parts of Europe and Asia, migration is mitigating population decline resulting from below-replacement fertility and population ageing. Net migration has already either prevented population decline or contributed to population growth in a number of countries. UNFPA at work UNFPA promotes the agenda of the International Conference on Population and Development in the area of migration by promoting policy dialogue and enhancing governments' ability to respond to issues relating to international migration, to promote orderly migration flows and to address the needs of migrants. The Fund supports research and policy-oriented studies, organizes meetings and assists governments in their capacity to collect migration statistics, including gender-specific data. UNFPA advocates for addressing the special concerns of women migrants, including elimination of discrimination, abuse and trafficking. UNFPA works with governments, other UN agencies and non-governmental organizations to meet the emergency reproductive health needs of refugees and internally displaced women. UNFPA also provides reproductive health services and counselling for victims of trafficking, and technical assistance, training, and support to governments and other agencies to develop policies and legal frameworks to combat the problem.

An accuracy assessment has been carried out for five countries for which a very reliable 1-km population density grid exists; the improvement, compared with the choropleth map per commune, ranges between 20% for the weakest result in Finland and 62% for the best result in the Netherlands. The best results are obtained with a method using logit regression to integrate information from the point survey LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey); however, performance differences between methods are moderate. The dasymetric grid is distributed free of charge by the European Environment Agency, for non-commercial use.

Picture that field overrun with adolescent girls, however-girls mastering skills, gaining respect for their bodies, demonstrating achievement to their communities-and the concept of sport as an intervention becomes clearer. In a recent commentary, Population Council associate Martha Brady sets forth an argument for sports programs as a way to empower and inform girls, a goal assuming prominence in the Council and other non-governmental organizations concerned with women's rights and human development. "Girls are under tremendous pressure to begin sexual activity and childbearing early. We must address the whole girl and give her the skills and knowledge she needs to exert more control over her life. It makes sense to reach girls at work, school, and play," says Brady. (excerpt)

AB  - In some cases male animals engage in aggressive contests for access to females, in others they adopt more passive strategies and invest in traits that assist them in detecting females or in competing with rivals in other ways, such as sperm competition. One possible factor determining the fitness of these different strategies is population density. Theoretically, aggressive tactics should be found at intermediate population densities. At low densities males that invest in traits related to searching for mates could be favoured, whereas at the highest densities males that fight over females might pay excessive costs for this behaviour because of the number of rival males that they will encounter. Current empirical evidence is mostly consistent with this scheme: in some cases it seems that traits that are associated with locating mates are favoured at low densities, with aggression related traits favoured at higher densities, and in other cases aggression is selected but as density increases less aggressive strategies become more common. There remain substantial differences between species, however, and I discuss how variation in mating system, in the costs of aggression and in the nature of sperm competition, plus ecological differences between species, can change the relationship between population density and the fitness consequences of aggressive and passive behavioural strategies.

Antler weights were also considered as condition index of stags. The mean body weight of calves of both sexes was identical, ie 38.0 kg, that of hinds fluctuated from 57.8 to 75.1 kg, stags - from 63.2 to 132.4 kg depending upon age. The KFI value for female and male calves, hinds, and stags at various age amounted respectively to: 1.54, 1.36, 1.60-1.76, and 1.17-2.69. Per cent of individuals with great amount of visceral fat amounted: in female calves - to 39.4, in male calves - 33.3, in hinds - 47.6-66.7, and in stags - 20.0-100.0% depending upon age. Maximum weight of antlers was 4.2 kg. Despite high population density animals indicated generally good physical condition. Except that the condition of calves of both sexes has been maintained at a similar level, what evidenced an inferior condition of males during their growth. Males in contrast to females, reveal serious decline of condition following the rut, during autumn and winter.

AB  - Theoretical models concerning how neighborhood contexts adversely influence juvenile antisocial behavior frequently focus on urban neighborhoods; however, previous studies comparing urban and rural areas on the prevalence of youth antisocial behavior have yielded mixed results. The current study uses longitudinal data on the offspring of a nationally representative sample of mothers (N = 4,886) in the US. There was no relation between density and mother-reported child conduct problems across ages 4-13 years, but youth living in areas of greater population density exhibited more youth self-reported delinquency across 10-17 years. Families often moved to counties with greater or lesser population density, but longitudinal analyses treating population density as a time-varying covariate did not support the hypothesis that living in densely populated counties influenced youth delinquency. Rather, the association between population density and delinquency appears to be due to unmeasured selection variables that differ between families who live in more or less densely populated counties.

AB  - An understanding of the extent to which marine populations are connected by larval dispersal is vital, both to comprehend past impacts and future prospects for sustaining biodiversity. Marine popu- lations and their supporting ecosystems are now subject to a multitude of threats, most notably overharvesting, pollution, and climate change (Hixon et al., 2001; Jackson et al., 2001; Hutchings and Reynolds, 2004; Kappel, 2005; Lotze et al., 2006). The intensity and scale of anthropogenic impacts in the worlds ocean have increased dramatically during the industrial age (Jackson et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006), and these impacts are combining to acceler- ate the loss and fragmentation of important coastal marine habitats, including man- groves (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996; Alongi, 2002), seagrasses (Duarte, 2002; Orth et al., 2006), kelp forests (Dayton et al., 1998; Steneck et al., 2002), and coral reefs (McClanahan, 2002; Gardiner et al., 2003; Hughes, et al., 2003; Aronson and Precht, 2006).

AB  - Understanding factors shaping the spatial distribution of animals is crucial for the conservation and management of wildlife species. However, few studies have investigated density-dependent habitat selection in wild populations in non-equilibrium conditions and at varying spatial scales. Here, we investigated density-dependent habitat selection at varying spatial scales in an increasing white stork Ciconia ciconia population using a long term data set in western France. During a 16-year study period, the breeding population density increased from 0.66 nests per 100 km2 to 6.6 nests per 100 km2. At the beginning of the colonisation of the area settlement probability of storks was mainly positively affected by grasslands located near wetlands. Areas with intensive or moderately intensive agriculture were extremely unlikely to be occupied by breeding birds. However, selection for the initially preferred habitats faded as stork density increased although the proportions of habitat types remained unchanged. At the same time selection for initially less favoured habitats had increased. Moreover, we found that the spatial scale of selection for each foraging habitat variable was consistent over time. Our results suggest that snapshot analyses of resource selection in populations at high density may be misleading for population conservation or management. In contrast, a longitudinal approach to resource selection can be a valuable tool for understanding resource limitation.

AB  - The population density of a Daphnia species seems more dependent on properties specific to the species than on those specific to the point in the season, location within a lake basin or the given lake itself. In spite of week-to-week fluctuations, the population density for each of two common European Daphnia species was found to be remarkably similar within single lakes (from station to station on a single date, and from date to date at a single station) as well as from lake to lake, regardless of trophic state. All lakes on all dates revealed densities in the range 10-50 ind l(-1) for the smaller-bodied D. cucullata and 1-5 ind l(-1) for the larger-bodied D. hyalina, in spite of different intensity of reproduction resulting from different food levels (chlorophyll a between 0.2 and 4.2 mug/l). It can be asserted that the population density of each species remains far below the carrying capacity of the habitat K, and does not depend on food levels, which merely set the rate of population increase, while the population density reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish. The reactive distance (the distance over which a foraging fish can see its prey) in 1+ roach, a dominant planktivore in the lakes studied, has been found to be twice as great for D. hyalina as for D. cucullata, whatever the light intensity. The relative reactive field volume was therefore an order of magnitude greater for the former than for the latter, showing that the densities of the two prey species would be assessed by a foraging roach as equal when, in reality, they differed by an order of magnitude, as they do in various lakes and in various seasons. The first of the two conclusions is that whatever the growth and reproduction in a population of a cladoceran such as Daphnia, its density would be fixed by mortality induced by fish predation. The second would be, that the difference between the bottom-up and top-down effects in freshwater is more than merely the upward or downward direction along the food web, since the bottom-up effects are about the flow control (the rate of net production, individual growth rate, rate of reproduction) and the top-down about the standing-crop control (biomass, individual body size, population density level).

AB  - Population density and home range are the two major ecological characteristics pertaining to the ecosystem-level energy use by the species. Home range usually grows more rapidly with body size than does individual metabolic rate. Neither this phenomenon nor the observed absence of isometry between inverse home range and population density (the latter often scaling as the reciprocal of metabolic rate in the inter-ecosystem comparisons) have received a general explanation. Here, we account in theory for the observed scaling exponents in the relationships of population density and inverse home range on body mass and verify our predictions by the available data on birds and mammals. In stable ecosystems, inverse population density and home range represent one and the same measure of animal space use and scale isometrically. Being tightly linked to many genetically encoded morphological and behavioral properties of the species, animal home range, unlike population density, does not change readily with the degree of ecosystem disturbance, thus representing a biological footprint of the undisturbed state of the ecosystem and the animal status within it. The difference between scaling exponents in the mass dependence of home range and inverse population density can reflect the degree of ecosystem disturbance. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Population density and urbanization  Introduction | Statistics | Standards and methods  The United Nations Statistics Division collects, compiles and disseminates data from national statistical offices on population density and urbanization through the Demographic Yearbook data collection system. A set of tables used in this collection system includes rural/urban breakdowns. Because of significant national differences (PDF 95 KB), ***there is no internationally agreed upon definition of urban and rural that would be applicable to all countries or even to all countries within a region.***  A number of tables presented in the Demographic Yearbook provide disaggregated statistics by urban and rural breakdown. In addition, data on population of capital cities and cities of 100,000 and more inhabitants are also available.  The United Nations Population Division uses these data as input for estimating urbanization. Those estimates are presented in World Urbanization Prospects.  The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) looks at urbanization from a different angle. It collects, collates, analyses and reports data on national, urban/rural and city level in order to monitor human settlement conditions and trends. UN-HABITAT publishes and disseminates data through the Compendium of Human Settlement Statistics, Statistical Annex to the Global report and the State of the World’s Cities Report 2001.

AB  - We conducted a factorial simulation experiment to analyze the relative importance of movement pattern, boundary-crossing probability, and mortality in habitat and matrix on population density, and its dependency on habitat fragmentation, as well as inter-patch distance. We also examined how the initial response of a species to a fragmentation event may affect our observations of population density in post-fragmentation experiments. We found that the boundary-crossing probability from habitat to matrix, which partly determines the emigration rate, is the most important determinant for population density within habitat patches. The probability of crossing a boundary from matrix to habitat had a weaker, but positive, effect on population density. Movement behavior in habitat had a stronger effect on population density than movement behavior in matrix. Habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance may have a positive or negative effect on population density. The direction of both effects depends on two factors. First, when the boundary- crossing probability from habitat to matrix is high, population density may decline with increasing habitat fragmentation. Conversely, for species with a high matrix-to-habitat boundary- crossing probability, population density may increase with increasing habitat fragmentation. Second, the initial distribution of individuals across the landscape: we found that habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance were positively correlated with population density when individuals were distributed across matrix and habitat at the beginning of our simulation experiments. The direction of these relationships changed to negative when individuals were initially distributed across habitat only. Our findings imply that the speed of the initial response of organisms to habitat fragmentation events may determine the direction of observed relationships between habitat fragmentation and population density. The time scale of post-fragmentation studies must, therefore, be adjusted to match the pace of post-fragmentation movement responses.

AB  - Until about 13,000 years ago all humans obtained their food through hunting and gathering, but thereafter people in some parts of the world began a transition to agriculture. Recent data strongly implicate climate change as the driving force behind the agricultural transition in southwest Asia. We propose a model of this process in which population and technology respond endogenously to climate. The key idea is that after a lengthy period of favorable environmental conditions during which regional population grew significantly, an abrupt climate reversal forced people to take refuge at a few ecologically favored sites. The resulting spike in local population density reduced the marginal product of labor in foraging and made agriculture attractive. Once agriculture was initiated, rapid technological progress through artificial selection on plant characteristics led to domesticated varieties. Farming became a permanent part of the regional economy when this productivity growth was combined with climate recovery

The relationship between body size (W), number of species, and population density (D) was investigated in tropical intertidal communities on the Pacific coast of Panama to address two main questions: (i) does an inverse relationship between body size and average population density like that observed in temperate Chilean rocky intertidal habitats occur in other intertidal communities at other latitudes? and (ii) to what extent does the body size-density relationship depend on variation in predation in these habitats? 2. Like their temperate counterparts, intertidal communities in Panama exhibit a lognormal body size distribution: most species are of intermediate size, with smaller numbers of both smaller and larger species. Population abundances of Panamanian species are also log-normally distributed. However, in sharp contrast to the pattern observed in temperate communities, body size of Panamanian species is not correlated with average or maximum population density. 3. Densities of the most abundant species, those that fall on the upper boundary of the body size-density distribution, also were not significantly correlated with body size. The 'predicted' upper boundary slope (UBS), obtained from combining the lognormal distributions of body sizes and of population abundances, was much more negative than the observed UBS. 4. Experimental exclusion of a morphologically diverse and species-rich (> 22 species) assemblage of subtidal fishes that forage on intertidal organisms led to a weak but significant negative association between body size and density. A steep negative D-W relationship was observed fora subset of these species at sites in Costa Pica, where fish predation is low, suggesting that the differences in the body size-density patterns represent regional rather than latitudinal trends. 5. The ability of fishes to suppress the population density scaling is probably linked to the low recruitment of tropical benthic invertebrate species and the 'energy-independence' of these fishes from the intertidal zone. This predator guild can have great impact on all intertidal invertebrates and yet they might be little affected by intertidal prey as they also feed and spend most of the time subtidally.

AB  - Background The role of walking, as compared with vigorous exercise, in the prevention of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Data for women who are members of minority racial or ethnic groups are particularly sparse.Methods We prospectively examined the total physical-activity score, walking, vigorous exercise, and hours spent sitting as predictors of the incidence of coronary events and total cardiovascular events among 73,743 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. At base line, participants were free of diagnosed cardiovascular disease and cancer, and all participants completed detailed questionnaires about physical ac- tivity. We documented 345 newly diagnosed cases of coronary heart disease and 1551 total cardiovascular events.Results An increasing physical-activity score had aindicate that both walking and vigorous exercise are associated with substantial reductions in the incidence of cardio- vascular events among postmenopausal women, irre- spective of race or ethnic group, age, and body-mass index. Prolonged sitting predicts increased cardio- vascular risk. strong, graded, inverse association with the risk of both coronary events and total cardiovascular events. There were similar findings among white women and black women. Women in increasing quintiles of ener- gy expenditure measured in metabolic equivalents (the MET score) had age-adjusted relative risks of cor- onary events of 1.00, 0.73, 0.69, 0.68, and 0.47, respec- tively (P for trend, <0.001). In multivariate analyses, the inverse gradient between the total MET score and the risk of cardiovascular events remained strong (ad- justed relative risks for increasing quintiles, 1.00, 0.89, 0.81, 0.78, and 0.72, respectively; P for trend <0.001). Walking and vigorous exercise were associated with similar risk reductions, and the results did not vary substantially according to race, age, or body-mass in- dex. A brisker walking pace and fewer hours spent sitting daily also predicted lower risk. Conclusions These prospective data

AB  - The transport of flame surface density (FSD) in turbulent premixed flames has been studied using a database obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Three-dimensional freely propagating developing statistically planar turbulent premixed flames have been examined over a range of global Lewis numbers from 0.6 to 1.2. Simplified chemistry has been used and the emphasis is on the effects of Lewis number on FSD transport in the context of Reynolds-averaged closure modelling. Under the same initial conditions of turbulence, flames with low Lewis numbers are found to exhibit counter-gradient transport of FSD, whereas flames with higher Lewis numbers tend to exhibit gradient transport of FSD. Stronger heat release effects for lower Lewis number flames are found to lead to an increase in the positive (negative) value of the dilatation rate (normal strain rate) term in the FSD transport equation with decreasing Lewis number. The contribution of flame curvature to FSD transport is found to be influenced significantly by the effects of Lewis number on the curvature dependence of the magnitude of the reaction progress variable gradient, and on the combined reaction and normal diffusion components of displacement speed. The modelling of the various terms of the FSD transport equation has been analysed in detail and the performance of existing models is assessed with respect to the terms assembled from corresponding quantities extracted from DNS data. Based on this assessment, suitable models are identified which are able to address the effects of non-unity Lewis number on FSD transport, and new or modified models are suggested wherever necessary. ?? 2011 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - In a model on population and endogenous technological change, Kremer (1993) combines a short-run Malthusian scenario where income determines the population that can be sustained, with the Boserupian insight that greater population spurs technological change and can therefore lift a country out of its Malthusian trap. We show that a more realistic version of the model, which combines population and population density, allows deeper insights into these processes. The incorporation of population density also allows a superior interpretation of the empirical regularities between the level of population, population density, population growth, and economic development at aggregated and disaggregated levels.

AB  - The ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is of great interest from a bioenergetic perspective because, although it has a very high respiratory capacity, the respiratory system does not appear to be primarily required for energy conservation. To investigate the regulation of respiratory genes and function of electron transport branches in Z. mobilis, several mutants of the common wild-type strain Zm6 (ATCC 29191) were constructed and analyzed. Mutant strains with a chloramphenicol-resistance determinant inserted in the genes encoding the cytochrome b subunit of the bc (1) complex (Zm6-cytB), subunit II of the cytochrome bd terminal oxidase (Zm6-cydB), and in the catalase gene (Zm6-kat) were constructed. The cytB and cydB mutants had low respiration capacity when cultivated anaerobically. Zm6-cydB lacked the cytochrome d absorbance at 630nm, while Zm6-cytB had very low spectral signals of all cytochromes and low catalase activity. However, under aerobic growth conditions, the respiration capacity of the mutant cells was comparable to that of the parent strain. The catalase mutation did not affect aerobic growth, but rendered cells sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Cytochrome c peroxidase activity could not be detected. An upregulation of several thiol-dependent oxidative stress-protective systems was observed in an aerobically growing ndh mutant deficient in type II NADH dehydrogenase (Zm6-ndh). It is concluded that the electron transport chain in Z. mobilis contains at least two electron pathways to oxygen and that one of its functions might be to prevent endogenous oxidative stress.

AB  - Fishers (Martes pennanti) were almost extirpated in Ontario, Canada, south of the French and Mattawa rivers by the 1940s but have recolonized much of their former range over the past several decades. We assessed the effect of the current harvest quota on a fisher population in eastern Ontario by estimating home range size and population density from a sample of radiocollared animals. Mean (± SD) adult home ranges (based on annual 95% min. convex polygons) were consistently smaller than those reported in the literature (M: 11 ± 4.4 km2; F: 2.1 ± 0.8 km2), with up to 71% overlap of adjacent intrasexual home ranges. This yielded an estimated adult fisher population density of 32.7/100 km2 of suitable habitat, as defined by the habitat composition within observed home ranges. We further estimated that between 2003 and 2005, trappers harvested 17.8-42.3% of the pretrapping population. These results suggest that although current fisher population density is high in our study area compared to reported densities in other areas, harvest rate is also high and an increase in quota is unwarranted.

AB  - Space use patterns of California voles are described from intensive live-trapping data obtained during the late breeding season in a peak density year. Operational sex rations were strongly female biased. Breeding males had mutually exclusive home ranges that overlapped the home ranges of one to several females. The average male home range was larger than the average female home range and tended to encompass female home ranges in their entirety. Breeding females had home ranges that often overlapped extensively with the home ranges of other breeding females. The degree of overlap, however, tended to be either very high or very low, indicating that groups of females may act territorially among themselves. Family groups that may include members of sequential litters formed at high density. Males on experimental removal grids had larger home ranges than males on the high density grids and some became wanderers while most females had home ranges comparable to those on the high density grids. Dispersers onto low density grids were not a random sample of the high density population; large breeding adults and small juveniles were under-represented. No sex differences in dispersal were noted. Immigration into the high density populations was probably negligible.

AB  - An individual-based simulation model was used to study the effect of the relative location of food and nest sites in the landscape on the relationship between the breeding habitat patch size and bird population density. The model predicted that when both food and nest sites are located exclusively in the breeding habitat patches, larger patches tend to harbor higher population densities. But when food starts to be added to the ‘matrix’ habitat and taken out of the breeding habitat the advantageous effect of larger patches diminishes and eventually the trend reverses, with small patches having higher population densities. This pattern arises from the combined effect of the existence of an extended foraging area around patches and an intrinsic advantage of large habitat patches associated with the concentration of food resources and potential colonizers. The effects of interspecific interactions and the management implications of the model are discussed

AB  - Field studies were conducted to clarify whether variation in food availability among habitats influences population density, and whether population density has a negative effect on foraging success in the orb-web spider, Nephila clavata. Lifetime food consumption per individual (i.e., foraging success) strongly correlated with mean body size of adult females and mean fecundity in populations. Also, there was a positive correlation between foraging success and population density. Since foraging success reflected potential prey availability in the habitat, food resource appeared to be a limiting factor for populations in this spider. Mean fecundity per individual correlated with population density of the following year, suggesting that decreased reproduction is a major component of food limitation on population density. Consistent differences in mean body size between particular sites were observed over years, while such difference was less obvious in density. Thus, ranking of food abundance among habitats seems to be predictable between years. A field experiment revealed that an artificial increase in population density had no negative effect on the feeding rate of individuals, suggesting that intraspecific competition for food is not important in this species.

AB  - Densities of sika deer resident in Scottish forests were commonly between 4 and 20 km-2 although densities in the region of 35 km-2 were encountered locally in thicket stage forest. Densities were similar to red deer in all forest stages except pre-felling, where sika attained higher densities (circa 11 km-2). Sika deer spent more time close to the edge of concealing habitats and were more circumspect in their behavior when feeding than red deer. The population of sika deer in South Scotland was estimated by cohort analysis and population simulation to be in the region of 500 to 600 in 1990. It was one of the most fertile populations in Scotland and could sustain a cull in the region of 25% per annum, compared to around 20% for Scottish woodland red deer. Sika were more fertile than red deer, in all age classes

AB  - The unresolved difficulties associated with defining and measuring population density strictly circumscribe the scope and nature of the conclusions that can be properly derived from differentials in man:land ratios. Any conclusions about human density will have meaning only to the extent that they are based on a recognition that this density must be viewed in both static and dynamic terms and that it cannot be isolated in analysis, from either the social and cultural setting, the demographic characteristics of the population, or the broader processes of social change within the society. In and of itself, the familiar man:land ratio says more about area than it does about either the human experience of density or the relation of population to resources. This ratio is therefore essentially meaningless as an indicator of comparative conditions of life among different countries and different geographic regions. The mere fact of having a relatively low average population density thus, does not automatically entitle a nation to complacency about its ability to adjust readily to future population change, either in terms of growth in numbers or in the geographic location of its people.

AB  - Home ranges of desert iguanas, Dipsosaurus dorsalis, were compared during the breeding season at three localities that differed in adult population density. The abundance, richness, and diversity of plant resources varied across sites. Although home range size was not correlated with population density, increasing density was associated with greater home range overlap and a tendency for activity to be restricted to the home range interior. For both males and females, the level of home range advertisement, measured as the frequency of push-up displays, increased with increasing population density. The lack of a reciprocal relationship between population density and home range size may be a consequence of the non-uniform distribution of plants at the three sites. When increases in home range size do not produce linear increases in resources, as is the case for many herbivorous species, patterns of space use may be less related to population density per se than to the distribution of conspecifics and plant resources at a particular site.

AB  - Population density, one of the most fundamental demographic attributes, may vary systematically with spatial scale, but this scale-sensitivity is incompletely understood. We used a novel approach-based on fully censused and mapped distributions of eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) dreys, beaver (Castor canadensis) lodges, and moose (Alces alces)--to explore the scale-dependence of population density and its relationship to landscape features. We identified population units at several scales, both objectively, using cluster analysis, and arbitrarily, using artificial bounds centred on high-abundance sites. Densities declined with census area. For dreys, this relationship was stronger in objective versus arbitrary population units. Drey density was inconsistently related to patch area, a relationship that was positive for all patches but negative when non-occupied patches were excluded. Drey density was negatively related to the proportion of green-space and positively related to the density of buildings or roads, relationships that were accentuated at coarser scales. Mean drey densities were more sensitive to scale when calculated as organism-weighted versus area-weighted averages. Greater understanding of these scaling effects is required to facilitate comparisons of population density across studies.

AB  - Since the 1950s, the government of Vietnam has established a vast network of primary health facilities. In addition to improving the health of individuals, this system aims to promote healthcare equity throughout the country. Services include comprehensive prenatal care and delivery services, care throughout early childhood, and services for basic health needs throughout a person's life. Evidence suggests that these services have lowered infant and child mortality rates and improved life expectancy at all ages. However, recent research by the Population Council suggests that progress has been more rapid among the ethnic majority population than among ethnic minority groups in Vietnam. The country's early health initiatives for the there are more than 50 in Vietnam-from the majority of Vietnamese. Evidence from national surveys and other studies indicates that these minority groups are generally poorer than the Kinh majority. Social indicators, such as levels of educational attainment, show that minorities are disadvantaged. Moreover, studies of health indicators demonstrate that minorities have higher morbidity and mortality rates than Kinh of equivalent ages. Population Council researchers Bussarawan Teerawichitchainan and James F. Phillips used data from the 2001-2002 Vietnam National Health Survey (VNHS) to assess parental recall of illness among their children under age 5 and analyze details of parents' care-seeking once they reported that their children were self-care. At the second visit the survey takers used the diaries to prompt discussions about the illnesses that had occurred in the past month. In the survey, respiratory infection and diarrhea-two of the biggest killers of children under age 5-were distinguished from other childhood illnesses. These maladies accounted for 31 and 11 percent respectively of all reported illnesses among under-5 children. (excerpt)

AB  - This paper examines how climate change policy can impact on competition, prices and profitability in the air transport industry. It begins with an outline of the climate change policies that have been suggested, and it gives particular attention to the inclusion of air transport in an emissions trading scheme (ETS).This is likely to prove an important policy direction, with the EU, Australia and New Zealand all planning to include air transport in their ETSs. The scope for airlines to reduce their emissions intensity in the short run and long run is examined- it is concluded that the scope in the short run is quite limited. After this, the application of the emissions trading schemes of the EU, Australia and New Zealand to air transport is discussed, and the possible impacts on air fares are assessed. Allowance is made for the cost of permits for both direct and indirect emissions. The impacts of climate change policies, such as carbon taxes or requirements to purchase emissions permits, on airline competition, prices and profitability are analysed next. Impacts differ according to market structure- whether airline city pair markets are competitive, monopolistic or oligopolistic. They also depend on the time scale- airlines are unlikely to be able to pass on the full cost of their permits to their passengers in the short run, though in the long run, it is likely that airlines will exit from some city pairs, and this will enable to remaining airlines to raise their fares and restore their profitability. This may not occur in markets constrained by airport slots or capacity limits imposed in air services agreements on international routes, though the airlines problems are not likely to be as severe as has been suggested. If permits are provided free of charge to airlines, fares should still rise in the long run, assuming that airlines are profit maximisers and factor in the opportunity cost of the permits they obtain free. However even if airlines do this, there can be cases where fares do not rise by as much as they would if permits have to be purchased, because the operation of the ETS may discourage exit from markets. If airlines do not act as profit maximisers, air fare increases will be limited, and airlines will have the scope to cross subsidise less profitable routes. The limited evidence on airlines use of free inputs (such as airport slots) is examined to obtain insights into whether airlines do indeed maximise their profits- this evidence is inconclusive. Finally the application of an ETS to international air transport is considered this can give rise to issues of competitive non-neutrality, even when permits are sold.

At 28 wk of age, one bird was removed from each cage in Treatment 5, and one bird was added to each cage in Treatments 6 and 7. In the first three experiments, all eggs that were collected for 2 consecutive d every 8 wk starting at 28 wk of age were used to measure egg traits. In Experiment 4, egg traits were determined once at 52 week of age. Birds at the highest population density had the lowest percentage hen-day egg production and had one of the poorest feed efficiencies. Egg production was negatively correlated (P < or = .01, Experiments 1, 2, 3; P < or = .05, Experiment 4) with population density. Feed required to produce a dozen eggs was positively correlated (P < or = .01, Experiments 1, 2; P < or = .05, Experiment 3) with population density in three out of the four experiments. The addition or removal of a cage mate to or from a multiple-bird cage in Experiment 4 did not (P > .05) affect egg production or feed efficiency. Final BW, mortality, and egg weight were not (P > .05) affected by population density. Only in one out of the four experiments was feed consumption (Experiment 1), eggshell thickness (Experiment 2), or albumen height (Experiment 3 lowered (P < or = .05) by having more than one bird per cage. This study showed that increasing population density decreased laying performance of the birds.

AB  - Uganda's population increased from 4.7 million in 1950 to 15.5 million in 1985, representing a present growth rate of 3.5%. The government realizes that rapid population growth has created underemployment and unemployment, but does not view the issue as critical to present development. Death rates have declined rapidly but birth rates have remained high, largely due to poverty, early marriage by females, illiteracy, and women's low educational status. The government has recently developed an official policy to decrease population growth and is now working with the Family Planning Association of Uganda to 1) lower the population growth rate from 3% to 2.6% and 2) increase the population's physical, mental, and social quality. Current life expectancy is now 52 years, and infant mortality is 94/1000. Health care has deteriorated in recent years as hospitals have closed and medical personnel have left the country. Government priorities include maternal and child health care, diarrhoeal control, and environmental sanitation. The fertility rate is projected to fall from the current 6.9 rate to 6.3 by the year 2000. Government fertility reduction plans include 1) merging family planning and maternal and child health services, 2) sex education in schools, 3) population education, 4) maternity and paternity benefits, and 5) raising the legal marriage age. Abortion for contraception purposes is illegal; sterilization is legal. 1) Refugee repatriation to Sudan, 2) Indo-Pakistani expulsion (1972), and 3) mass flight in the 1970s have affected Uganda's recent development. The government encourages skilled Ugandans living abroad to return home. Urban growth has increased from 8% in 1979 to 14% in 1985; to slow rural to urban migration, the government plans to encourage and educate people to remain on the land, encourage the development of specific areas, repair and maintain urban areas, and improve land access and resettlement opportunities.

A pilot project in New York City, which designed and implemented a first-response capability for medical emergencies in corporations, using employees in a system congruent with the fire warden plans in effect, was completed in May 1977. To obtain an initial assessment of the medical impact of such training and the effectiveness of such a medical emergency response system during the pilot phase, The Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York City, Inc., obtained reports from the 24 participating corporations on all reported medical and surgical emergencies occurring in the working environment. The authors conclude that this approach to development of a first response-capability can provide an effective community base for an effective Emergency Medical Services system in urban areas.

AB  - Population Council researchers recently completed studies in Pakistan and Nepal of attitudes and behaviors surrounding violence against women during pregnancy. These investigations were some of the first of their kind in South Asia. They probed the level of awareness of domestic violence among obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) in Karachi, Pakistan, and of OB/ GYNs, assistant nurse midwives, and traditional birth attendants in Kathmandu, Nepal. Postpartum women in Karachi and Kathmandu were surveyed to augment knowledge about the scope, context, and consequences of violence faced by pregnant women. In a separate study, men in Karachi were interviewed about domestic violence. Although preliminary and limited to two urban areas, the studies suggest a high level of physical abuse during pregnancy and provide some empirical basis for developing realistic interventions to protect the lives of women and their children.

AB  - World population is projected to reach 7 billion early in 2012, up from the current 6.8 billion, and surpass 9 billion people by 2050, reveals the 2008 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, released today. Most of the additional 2.3 billion people will enlarge the population of developing countries, which is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050, and will be distributed among the population aged 15-59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries will decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to change minimally, passing from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and would have declined to 1.15 billion were it not for the projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is projected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. The results of the 2008 Revision incorporate the findings of the most recent national population censuses and of numerous specialized population surveys carried out around the world. The 2008 Revision provides the demographic data and indicators to assess trends at the global, regional and national levels and to calculate many other key indicators commonly used by the United Nations system.

AB  - Two general expansions of urban density models are used to account for directional bias in complex urban forms. These expansions can be applied to simple functions where density is continuously declining with distance, or to more complex functions where maximum density is reached at some distance from the urban center. This approach may be required for more realistic empirical analysis, such as accounting for the axial bias typical of most cities.

AB  - Explanations for why population dynamics vary across the range of a species reflect two contrasting hypotheses: (i) temporal variability of populations is larger in the centre of the range compared to the margins because overcompensatory density dependence destabilizes population dynamics and (ii) population variability is larger near the margins, where populations are more susceptible to environmental fluctuations. In both of these hypotheses, positions within the range are assumed to affect population variability. In contrast, the fact that population variability is often related to mean population size implies that the spatial structure of the population size within the range of a species may also be a useful predictor of the spatial variation in temporal variability of population size over the range of the species. To explore how population temporal variability varies spatially and the underlying processes responsible for the spatial variation, we focused on the intertidal barnacle Chthamalus dalli and examined differences in its population dynamics along the tidal levels it inhabits. Changes in coverage of barnacle populations were monitored for 10·5 years at 25 plots spanning the elevational range of this species. Data were analysed by fitting a population dynamics model to estimate the effects of density-dependent and density-independent processes on population growth. We also examined the temporal mean-variance relationship of population size with parameters estimated from the population dynamics model. We found that the relative variability of populations tended to increase from the centre of the elevational range towards the margins because of an increase in the magnitude of stochastic fluctuations of growth rates. Thus, our results supported hypothesis (2). We also found that spatial variations in temporal population variability were well characterized by Taylor's power law, the relative population variability being inversely related to the mean population size. Results suggest that understanding the population dynamics of a species over its range may be facilitated by taking the spatial structure of population size into account as well as by considering changes in population processes as a function of position within the range of the species.

AB  - We analyze a growth model where the damage of pollution depends on population density and the character of pollution. From the steady state rates of change, in the social optimum, of a neoclassical and a semi-endogenous growth model respectively, we conclude that the less responsive the damage of pollution is to population density, the more likely is a development path with positive growth in consumption per capita and declining perceived pollution per capita. Non-awareness of the character of pollution may thus give suboptimal solutions. In particular, the commonly held view that pollution is a pure public bad may lead to growth-rate targets that are lower than optimal. Finally, we find that the character of pollution does not influence the transitional dynamics qualitatively.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the construction of a working life tables for males and females in South Africa using the 1996 and 2001 population censuses. The main objective of the paper is to illustrate the use of life table analysis in the examination of the labour force using South African data. The study indicates that based on the 1996 census a South African male who survives to age 15 is expected to live 40.9 years, out of which 35.3 years are expected to be spent in active status and the remaining 5.3 years in inactive years. Similar values for South African females are 49.9 years, 37.9 years and 12 years, respectively. Using 2001 census the study indicates that a South African male who survives to age 15 was expected to live 43.9 years of which 36 years will be in active and 8 years will be inactive whereas a South African female was expected to live 50 years of which 34 years will be active and 16 years will be inactive. It was estimated that out of the total number of males who left the working population in 1996, 50 percent left because of death and another 50 percent left for other reasons other than death. The corresponding figures for females are 28 percent and 62 percent respectively. In 2001, 64 percent of the males left the labour force due to deaths whereas 36 percent left due to other causes. Similar figures for females are 45 percent and 55 percent respectively. These figures suggest an increased proportion of men and women are leaving the labour force due to deaths. This means that mortality takes a heavy toll of the seemingly short economically active life. Probably, this is a reflection of the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on the working population.

AB  - Scaling relationships that describe variation in population density with body size in ecological communities, such as the thinning law in plant ecology(1-3), can be explained in terms of how individuals use resources as a function of their size. Data for rates of xylem transport as a function of stem diameter show that rates of resource use in individual plants scale as approximately the 3/4 power of body mass, which is the same as metabolic rates of animals(4-7). Here we use this relationship to develop a mechanistic model for relationships between density and mass in resource-limited plants. It predicts that average plant size should scale as the -4/3 power of maximum population density, in agreement with empirical evidence and comparable relationships in animals(5,6,8), but significantly less than the -3/2 power predicted by geometric models(1). Our model implies that fundamental constraints on metabolic rate are reflected in the scaling of population density and other ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including the finding that resource allocation among species in ecosystems is independent of body size(5,6,8).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suicide rates among men have increased in Scotland while falling in neighbouring countries. A national suicide prevention strategy has been produced. Previous work found that some rural areas of Scotland had higher than average rates of male suicide and undetermined deaths. This article describes the association between population density and suicide and undetermined death rates in Scotland. METHODS: Anonymised information on deaths from suicide and undetermined cause in Scotland were obtained from the General Registrar Office for 1981-1999, including information on postcode sector. Each postcode sector was assigned a deprivation and population density score. Loglinear models were used to examine the effects of time period (grouped into four periods), deprivation quintiles, population density (grouped into four categories) and their interactions in each sex in three age groups. A significance level of 5% was used throughout. Adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were based on models that included only significant factors and interactions. RESULTS: In men, there were higher rate ratios in the most densely populated and least densely populated quartiles, with intermediate rate ratios in other areas. There was no association with population density in women aged less than 25 years, a similar pattern to men in 25-44 year old women, and lower rates in rural areas in older women. Higher levels of deprivation were associated with higher rate ratios of suicide in both sexes and all age groups. Rate ratios over time increased in younger men and women, remained stable in older men, and declined in older women. CONCLUSIONS: Deprivation is associated with higher rates of suicide and undetermined deaths at all levels of population density and in all age groups. The highest rates of suicide among men are in the most and least densely populated areas, after adjusting for deprivation. The effect is different among women, with no effect among younger women, and lower rates among older women in areas with lower population density.

AB  - Whether house prices rise faster or slower than average incomes affects the level of home ownership and the riskiness of different means of financing house purchase. This study develops a model of the housing market with the property that the major determinant of house price rises relative to incomes is the evolution of population density. The model implies that if population density is on an upward trajectory, rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price responses and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. Rises in population density make high and rising levels of house prices likely; this makes alternatives to standard debt financing of home ownership become more desirable. The impact this has on the structure of risk-sharing contracts between providers of outside equity and homeowners is analysed.

AB  - This article describes a high-resolution land cover data set for Spain and its application to dasymetric population mapping (at census tract level). Eventually, this vector layer is transformed into a grid format. The work parallels the effort of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, in collaboration with Eurostat and the European Environment Agency (EEA), in building a population density grid for the whole of Europe, combining CORINE Land Cover with population data per commune. We solve many of the problems due to the low resolution of CORINE Land Cover, which are especially visible with Spanish data. An accuracy assessment is carried out from a simple aggregation of georeferenced point population data for the region of Madrid. The bottom-up grid constructed in this way is compared to our top-down grid. We show a great improvement over what has been reported from commune data and CORINE Land Cover, but the improvements seem to come entirely from the higher resolution data sets and not from the statistical modeling in the downscaling exercise. This highlights the importance of providing the research community with more detailed land cover data sets, as well as more detailed population data. The dasymetric grid is available free of charge from the authors upon request.

AB  - The existence of a general relation between population density and body size in animal assemblages has been debated because of known biases and ambiguities in the published data and data handling. Using new comprehensive data sets from two geographically separated stream communities that encompass 448 and 260 invertebrate taxa with a wide range of body sizes, we show that an inverse proportionality between density and body size is a consistent feature in these communities. The scaling across taxa is not statistically different between the two systems, indicating a convergent pattern of communities. Variation in the regression slope among different taxonomic groups indicates that these communities are not governed universally by a single ecological or energetic rule.

AB  - The title of this paper implies that reproductive success may be related to population density. Consequently it also implies that the regulation of population growth also may be related to density, assuming that patterns of mortality are not completely aberrant. Such relationships are well recognized. However, one need not go far back to find marked disagreement between the advocates of “density-dependent” regulation of population growth and the proponents of “density-independent” regulation by such factors as climate, availability of water, and the like. Of course, it should have been anticipated that both kinds of mechanisms operate depending on the species and the circumstances. Thus one might reasonably expect density-independent mechanisms to be more important in marginal habitats, for newly introduced aliens or, for that matter, for native populations whose biotic environment has been grossly altered. Also, one would expect increasing manifestation of density dependence with increasing independence from the environment, as with homeothermy in contrast to poikilothermy in terrestrial animals. There should be no necessity for categorically relegating either group of regulating mechanisms to insignificance, as each must be considered in the context of the particular population under scrutiny as well as its setting. However, this account is concerned mainly with density-dependent mechanisms in mammals, particularly in rodents, and primarily with respect to their reproduction.

The modeler may, however, be interested in estimating the distribution of parameter values in the population from which the individuals are sampled. Some applications of population estimation, a survey of approaches to the estimation problem and some current work will be discussed. The approaches discussed include the "naive pooled data approach," two stage methods, the first order method proposed by Sheiner and Beal and a nonparametric maximum likelihood procedure. General approaches employing Bayes' Theorem are also considered.

AB  - The Management Plan for the Lynx Population in Finland was drawn up applying the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, Recommendations of the Standing Committee No 59 (1997) and No 74 (1999) as well as the IUCN's principle of sustainable use and on the obligations laid down in Council Directive 92/43/EC on the protection of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna (the Habitats Directive), so as to fulfil the international obligations placed on Finland. In drawing up the management plan there was a broad hearing of local people, regional actors and national stakeholder groups. The lynx management plan is divided into two parts. The first part sets a background for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's policy on the lynx. It describes the biology of the lynx and status of the lynx on the basis of up-todate research information. The first part also deals with national legislation, international obligations and forms of international cooperation. The management plan presents the basic socio-economic outlines of policy based on the biology of the lynx or which are considered important. By implementing these policy outlines, Finland will continue systematic management of the lynx population and establish the lynx population as a permanent feature of Finnish nature and its biodiversity. The basic objective of Finland's lynx population management and protection is to maintain the population at a favourable conservation level. The objective will be implemented by the combined effect of measures under various headings. The measures are presented regionally under the headings of lynx population management, damage prevention and the costs of damage prevention, compensation for loss and damage, exceptions to the protected status of the lynx, monitoring and research on the lynx population and their development, training, advisory services and information, supervision of hunting, transplantation of lynx, cooperation between various interested parties on national and international levels, updating of the management plan, and responsibilities for population management. In the measures to be implemented, consideration will be given to economic and social requirements and special regional and local features. The implementation of the management plan will be monitored and it will be updated as necessary.

AB  - We conducted a factorial simulation experiment to analyze the relative importance of movement pattern, boundary-crossing probability, and mortality in habitat and matrix on population density, and its dependency on habitat fragmentation, as well as inter-patch distance. We also examined how the initial response of a species to a fragmentation event may affect our observations of population density in post-fragmentation experiments. We found that the boundary-crossing probability from habitat to matrix, which partly determines the emigration rate, is the most important determinant for population density within habitat patches. The probability of crossing a boundary from matrix to habitat had a weaker, but positive, effect on population density. Movement behavior in habitat had a stronger effect on population density than movement behavior in matrix. Habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance may have a positive or negative effect on population density. The direction of both effects depends on two factors. First, when the boundary-crossing probability from habitat to matrix is high, population density may decline with increasing habitat fragmentation. Conversely, for species with a high matrix-to-habitat boundary-crossing probability, population density may increase with increasing habitat fragmentation. Second, the initial distribution of individuals across the landscape: we found that habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance were positively correlated with population density when individuals were distributed across matrix and habitat at the beginning of our simulation experiments. The direction of these relationships changed to negative when individuals were initially distributed across habitat only. Our findings imply that the speed of the initial response of organisms to habitat fragmentation events may determine the direction of observed relationships between habitat fragmentation and population density. The time scale of post-fragmentation studies must, therefore, be adjusted to match the pace of post-fragmentation movement responses.

AB  - This paper presents research results on the dasymetric mapping method, the methodology adopted and a Dasymetric Population Density Map of the Northeastern Part of Poland. After studying certain published dasymetric mapping methods, a decision was made to start from the binary dasymetric procedure as described by Langdorf and Unwin (1994) in order to eliminate unpopulated regions. The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database was utilized as ancillary data because the land cover pattern best reflects population density and provides useful georeferenced information for disaggregating census data. The first issued addressed was how is population distributed among CLC classes in Poland? Special attention was made to estimate the coefficients for the population ratio in land cover classes. Several different approaches were tested and eventually modified areal weighting was adopted. The dasymetric mapping method is based on the assumption that the ratio between the population density of two land cover categories is the same for any given commune.

AB  - Antibiotic consumption and population density as a measure of crowding in the community were related to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance of three cities in three different countries: St Johns in Newfoundland (Canada), Athens in Greece and Groningen in The Netherlands. Antibiotic consumption was expressed in DDD (defined daily dose), as DID (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) and as DSD (DDD/km(2)). The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and enterococci was determined in faecal samples of healthy volunteers. In both Newfoundland (28 DID) and Greece (29 DID) the overall consumption of antibiotics was more than three times higher compared with that of The Netherlands (9 DID). The lowest prevalence of resistant E. coli against the majority of antibiotics tested was found for the samples from Newfoundland and was significant (P < 0.05) for cefazolin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim. A poor correlation between the number of DID and the prevalence of resistance was observed [the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pcc) ranged between -0.93 and 0.87]. However, when population density was taken into consideration and antibiotic consumption was expressed in DSD, a strong correlation was observed (and Pcc ranged between 0.86 and 1.00). This study suggests that population density is an important factor in the development of antibiotic resistance and warrants special attention as a factor in resistance epidemiology.

AB  - Data from 487 municipal governments with populations greater than 50,000 are examined to see the relationship between population density and per capita government expenditures. There is no statistically significant relationship between per capita total government expenditures and operational expenditures for cities smaller than 500,000, and for larger cities, higher population density is associated with higher per capita government expenditures. Infrastructure expenditures tend to decline with increases in population density for cities smaller than 500,000, whereas expenditures on services tend to increase with population density for cities larger than 500,000. The relationship between per capita total expenditures and population density has policy relevance because it indicates that when all government expenditures are taken into account, policies that increase population density will not reduce per capita government expenditures and, in larger cities, will lead to higher per capita government expenditures.

AB  - Average daily rates of grasshopper survival were inversely related to density. For a hypothetical population of Melanoplus sanguinipes (F.), average survival rates of about 0.95 to 0.96 per day resulted in relatively uniform populations between generations; rates slightly above or below that range lead to drastic increases or decreases, respectively. There are reasonable combinations of daily survival rates and daily feeding rates that will allow ny developmental stage within a generation of grasshoppers in the field to dominate utilization of forage by that generation. It is most probable, however, that the first three nymphal instars will be responsible for about 15 to 20% of the total forage utilization, and that adults will be responsible for both the greatest daily rate and the greatest proportion of utilization. Utilization by a nymphal instar is likely to exceed that of adults only under conditions of catastrohic population collapse.

AB  - 1. Many animal species are detected primarily by sound. Although songs, calls and other sounds are often used for population assessment, as in bird point counts and hydrophone surveys of cetaceans, there are few rigorous methods for estimating population density from acoustic data. 2. The problem has several parts 2013 distinguishing individuals, adjusting for individuals that are missed, and adjusting for the area sampled. Spatially explicit capture2013recapture (SECR) is a statistical methodology that addresses jointly the second and third parts of the problem. We have extended SECR to use uncalibrated information from acoustic signals on the distance to each source. 3. We applied this extension of SECR to data from an acoustic survey of ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla density in an eastern US deciduous forest with multiple four-microphone arrays. We modelled average power from spectrograms of ovenbird songs measured within a window of 0·7 s duration and frequencies between 4200 and 5200 Hz. 4. The resulting estimates of the density of singing males (0·19 ha22121 SE 0·03 ha22121) were consistent with estimates of the adult male population density from mist-netting (0·36 ha22121 SE 0·12 ha22121). The fitted model predicts sound attenuation of 0·11 dB m22121 (SE 0·01 dB m22121) in excess of losses from spherical spreading. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our method for estimating animal population density from acoustic signals fills a gap in the census methods available for visually cryptic but vocal taxa, including many species of bird and cetacean. The necessary equipment is simple and readily available; as few as two microphones may provide adequate estimates, given spatial replication. The method requires that individuals detected at the same place are acoustically distinguishable and all individuals vocalize during the recording interval, or that the per capita rate of vocalization is known. We believe these requirements can be met, with suitable field methods, for a significant number of songbird species.

AB  - There is considerable evidence, from removal experiments and from the addition of resources, that territorial behavior can and does limit population density.  In short-term territory systems there is also evidence that territorial behaviour varies with resource level so as to change density in relation to resources.  Hypotheses on the mechanism of this, involving an interaction between the teritorial aggressiveness of initial settlers and the persistence and aggressiveness of later arrivals and non-territorial individuals, are discussed in detail.  Species with long-term territorial systems seem not to change their aggressiveness or territory size in response to short-term changes in resource abundance.  In such species, any adjustment of territory size to resource level must be carried out over a long period and more study is needed of the mechanisms involved.

AB  - The 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2013 NDHS) is the fifth in a series of Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in Nigeria; previous surveys were conducted in 1990, 1999, 2003, and 2008. The three most recent NDHS surveys of 1999, 2003, and 2008 were implemented by the National Population Commission. The field survey for the 2013 NDHS started with the training of trainers and the pretest of survey instruments in Makurdi, Benue State, from 12 - 28 November 2012. This was followed by the training of household listers in six zonal centres. A centralised one-month-long training of data collectors took place at the Administrative Staff College of Nigeria (ASCON), Topo Badagry, from 6 January 2013 to 4 February 2013. The field survey was carried out from the second week of February through the last week of May 2013, with the exception of the work of two teams: Kano and Lagos, who each completed the survey in the fourth week of June 2013. Teams visited 886 clusters across Nigeria and collected data from a nationally representative sample of 38,522 households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men age 15-49 in a subsample of half of the households were individually interviewed. The 2013 NDHS significantly expands follow-up to the 1990, 1999, 2003, and 2008 DHS surveys. It also provides updated estimates of some basic demographic and health indicators covered in the earlier surveys. In addition, the 2013 NDHS, like the 2008 NDHS, includes the collection of information on violence against women. Although previous surveys collected data at the national and zonal levels, the 2013 as well as the 2008 NDHS report collected data on key indicators from the six geo-political zones of South, South West, South East, North West, North East, and North Central as well as the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This preliminary report presents major findings of the survey. A comprehensive, detailed analysis of the data will be presented in a final report to be published during the first quarter of 2014. Although the figures in this preliminary report are not expected to differ much from the findings to be presented in the final report, the results shown here should be considered provisional and interpreted with caution. As with prior Nigerian DHS surveys, the 2013 NDHS was designed to provide data to monitor population and health in Nigeria. Its explicit goal was to provide reliable information about maternal and child health and family planning services. The 2013 NDHS specifically collected information on fertility levels, marriage, fertility preferences, awareness and use of family planning methods, child feeding practices, nutritional status of women and children, adult and childhood mortality, awareness and attitudes regarding HIV/AIDS, and domestic violence. This information is intended to assist policymakers and programme managers in evaluating and designing programmes and strategies for improving health and family planning services in the country.

AB  - The modelling of the tangential strain rate term in the Flame Surface Density (FSD) transport equation in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of turbulent premixed combustion has been addressed by a priori analysis of a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database of statistically planar freely propagating flames with wide variations of Damk??hler number Da, heat release parameter ?? and global Lewis number Le. It has been found that the dilatation rate contribution to the FSD transport strengthens with increasing value of ?? and decreasing value of Le. The behaviour of the normal strain rate term shows significant differences in response to Da and Le. It has been found that the normal strain rate contribution to the FSD transport remains a sink term for the flames with high and small values of Da and Le, respectively, where the effects of strain rate induced by heat release achem overcome the effects of turbulent straining aturb. By contrast, the effects of aturb overcomes the effects of achem for low Da flames with Le???1, which leads to a positive value of the normal strain rate term towards the unburned gas side, but this term becomes negative towards the burned gas side due to strong achem overcoming aturb in the regions of intense heat release. The strengthening of the dilatation rate and achem at small and large values of Le and Da, respectively, is explicitly taken into account to propose new models for the strain rate contributions to the FSD transport. The new model is shown to satisfactorily capture the effects of Damk??hler number Da, heat release parameter ??, and global Lewis number Le, on the tangential strain rate term of the FSD transport equation for all the cases considered in this study. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

AB  - Despite the importance of conservation and management of the European hare, a game species that has declined throughout Europe, little is known about its natal dispersal process. To date, only one radio-tracking study in a mixed cropping-farmed landscape provides a fine description of the dispersal pattern of this species. The study shows in particular a negative density dependence dispersal, juvenile hares dispersing more in a low-density hunting zone rather than in a high density non-hunting zone. Unfortunately, the effect of conspecific density on dispersal remains ambiguous due to the confounding effect of hunting. To provide more insight into the influence of conspecific numbers on the dispersal propensity in hares, we renewed the study in a harvested high density population. Our results confirmed the known sex-biased and age-related dispersal in this species but we did not find any effect of the birth site density on either the propensity to disperse or the distance moved in juvenile hares. Overall, the dispersal rate and bias were equal to those previously found in the high density non-hunting zone, where density was almost the same as in our population even though hunting pressure differed. Our results emphasize that natal dispersal is a ubiquitous feature in this species, which may respond more to density than hunting. © 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

On a construit des séries d'indicateurs conjoncturels de la fécondité pour les 21 régions fran\ccaises pour la période 1960-1979. Ces séries enregistrent, en général aux mêmes dates, les mêmes secousses qui affectent sur cette période la série des indicateurs nationaux. Leurs niveaux et tendances moyens restent en revanche très divers. On a ainsi toujours opposition d'un nord plus fécond et d'un sud moins fécond. Mais, le nord-est ayant eu tendance à décliner rapidement depuis 1962, il y a eu hausse relative des régions de l'ouest. Le sud se maintient à un niveau relatif assez bas. La région parisienne s'est fortement rapprochée de la moyenne nationale. Les mouvements d'un bon nombre de régions peuvent d'ailleurs être interprétés comme des mouvements d'alignement sur cette moyenne. La dispersion relative des niveaux de fécondité régionaux a en effet été réduite de moitié en vingt ans. Ce nivellement n'est cependant pas général. Ce sont les régions de l'ouest et du sud-ouest qui y échappent le plus nettement. Blanchet Didier. --- The Evolution of French Regional Fertility Differences since 1960. A series of cyclical fertility indicators for the 21 regions of France has been constructed for the period 1960-1979. In general, these indicators reflect changes in the series of national indicators of fertility at, roughly speaking, the same times. However, their averages and trend show considerable variation. There is always the contrast between a more fertile North and a less fertile South. However, fertility in the North Eastern regions has tended to fall rapidly since 1962, and there has been a relative increase in the fertility of the West. Fertility in the South remains at a relatively low level. Fertility in the Paris region is very near to the national average. Fertility movements in a number of regions may be interpreted as a convergence to the national average. The relative dispersion of regional fertility indicators during the last 20 years has been reduced by one-half. However, this levelling is not found throughout France, for the regions in the West and the South-West continue to deviate. Blanchet Didier. --- La fecundidad por regiones de Francia.

Los cambios en varias regiones pueden ser interpretados como movimientos de alineación con respecto a este promedio nacionál. La dispersion relativa de los nivelés de fecundidad régionales se ha reducido a la mitad en los últimos veinte afios. Pero esta nivelación no es uniforme, ya que las regiones del oeste y del sur oeste no siguen esta tendencia general.

AB  - Using a population density approach we study the dynamics of two interacting collections of integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) neurons representing thalamocortical (TC) cells from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and thalamic reticular (RE) cells from the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN). Each population of neurons is described by a multivariate probability density function that satisfies a conservation equation with appropriately defined probability fluxes and boundary conditions. The state variables of each neuron are the membrane potential and the inactivation gating variable of the low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T). The synaptic coupling of the populations and external excitatory drive are modeled by instantaneous jumps in the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons. The population density model is validated by comparing its response to time-varying retinal input to Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding IFB network composed of 100 to 1,000 cells per population. In the absence of retinal input, the population density model exhibits rhythmic bursting similar to the 7 to 14 Hz oscillations associated with slow wave sleep that require feedback inhibition from RE to TC cells. When the TC and RE cell potassium leakage conductances are adjusted to represent cholingergic neuromodulation and arousal of the network, rhythmic bursting of the probability density model may either persists or be eliminated depending on the number of excitatory (TC to RE) or inhibitory (RE to TC) connections made by each presynaptic cell. When the probability density model is stimulated with constant retinal input (10-100 spikes/sec), a wide range of responses are observed depending on cellular parameters and network connectivity. These include asynchronous burst and tonic spikes, sleep spindle-like rhythmic bursting, and oscillations in population firing rate that are distinguishable from sleep spindles due to their amplitude, frequency, or the presence of tonic spikes. In this context of dLGN/PGN network modeling, we find the population density approach using 2,500 mesh points and resolving membrane voltage to 0.7 mV is over 30 times more efficient than 1,000-cell Monte Carlo simulations.

AB  - World population is projected to reach 7 billion early in 2012, up from the current 6.8 billion, and surpass 9 billion people by 2050, reveals the 2008 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, released today. Most of the additional 2.3 billion people will enlarge the population of developing countries, which is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050, and will be distributed among the population aged 15-59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries will decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to change minimally, passing from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and would have declined to 1.15 billion were it not for the projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is projected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. The results of the 2008 Revision incorporate the findings of the most recent national population censuses and of numerous specialized population surveys carried out around the world. The 2008 Revision provides the demographic data and indicators to assess trends at the global, regional and national levels and to calculate many other key indicators commonly used by the United Nations system.

AB  - The negative relationship between body mass and population abundance was documented decades ago and forms one of the most fundamental scaling-laws in ecology. However, current theory fails to capture observed variations and the subject continues to raise controversy. Here we unify empirically observed size-abundance relationships with theory, by incorporating allometries in resource encounter rate and metabolic costs of movements. Fractal geometry is used to quantify the underlying resources distributions. Our model predicts that in environments packed with resources, body mass to population abundance relationships is less negative than the commonly assumed -3/4 power law. When resources are more patchily distributed, we predict a more negative exponent. These predictions are consistent with empirical observations. The current research provides an important step towards synthesizing metabolism, resource distribution and the global scaling of animal abundance, explaining why size-abundance relationships vary among feeding guilds and ecosystems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Population density, or the number of adults in an environment relative to the limiting resources, may have important long and short term consequences for the longevity of organisms. In this paper we summarize the way in which crowding may have an immediate impact on longevity, either through the phenomenon known as dietary restriction or through alterations in the quality of the environment brought on by the presence of large numbers of individuals. We also consider the possible long term consequences of population density on longevity by the process of natural selection. There has been much theoretical speculation about the possible impact of population density on the evolution of longevity but little experimental evidence has been gathered to test these ideas. We discuss some of the theory and empirical evidence that exists and show that population density is an important factor in determining both the immediate chances of survival and the course of natural selection.

AB  - Mortality data on more than one-third of the world's population is lacking and much of the demographic analysis needed in order to formulate plans for social and economic development is therefore seriously hampered. During recent years the combined efforts at the international and the national levels have re- sulted in significant improvements in remedying this situation. Estimates of mortality levels and of trends, however, are bound to remain the only recourse, as long as some countries have not developed efficient systems of census taking and of vital registration. This report, which has been prepared in partial implementation of the recom- mendation of the Population Commission to intensify demographic studies of under-developed countries, is believed to offer a useful tool in this respect. The series of forty model life-tables, which cover the entire range of mortality varia- tions that can be found today, provide a time- and labour-saving method of ap- proximating the most probable mortality level, by sex and age groups, for any population for which the infant or, better still, the early childhood mortality rate is known with a certain degree of accuracy

AB  - The concept of Functional Urban Regions (FURs), also called Metropolitan Regions (MRs), is not simple. It is clear, though, that they are not simply a combination of adjacent municipalities or areas. Different methods can be used for their definition. However, especially in developing countries, the application of some methods is not possible, due to the unavailability of detailed data. Alternative approaches have been developed based on spatial analysis methods and using variables extracted from available data. The objective of this study is to compare the results of two spatial analysis methods exploring two variables: population density and an indicator of transport infrastructure supply. The first method regards Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses tools, which define uniform regions based on specific variables. The second method used the same variables and the spatial analysis technique available in the computer program SKATER - Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal. Assuming that those classifications of regions with similar characteristics can be used for identifying potential FURs, the results of all analyses were compared with one another and with the 'official' MR. A combined approach was also considered for comparison, but none of the results match the existing MR boundaries, what challenges the official definitions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The influence of turbulent Reynolds number Ret on the statistical behaviour and modelling of flame surface density (FSD) transport has been analysed using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of freely propagating turbulent premixed flames with values of Ret ranging from 20 to 100. The variation of Ret is brought about by modifying the Damkohler and Karlovitz numbers independently of each other. The findings indicate that the qualitative behaviour of the various terms of the FSD transport equation remains unaffected by the changes in turbulent Reynolds number, but their relative contributions to the transport of FSD are affected to some extent. The effects of turbulent Reynolds number on the modelling of the turbulent transport term, the tangential strain rate term and the combined propagation and curvature terms are addressed in detail. It is demonstrated that model parameters for the turbulent transport and tangential strain rate term exhibit turbulent Reynolds number dependence for small values of Ret and assume asymptotic values for Ret P 50. By contrast, the model parameters for the combined propagation and curvature term are found to be insensitive to the variation of turbulent Reynolds number. Existing models for the turbulent transport term and the tangential strain rate term are modified to account for the observed turbulent Reynolds number dependence. ?? 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between population growth, agricultural production, and urban development. Ongoing debate in the literature regarding the relationship between population and economic development is restricted by the limited availability of time series data and the difficulty of evaluating causality using cross-sectional data. This analysis uses the special case of Jordan with its massive refugee flows to evaluate the influence of a sudden and exogenous change in population in urban areas on the intensification of agricultural production. Spearman Rank Order correlations are calculated from time series data to show that the districts which experienced the most rapid population growth and increases in population density also exhibited the largest increases in agricultural intensity. Cross-sectional analysis in which measures of agricultural intensification were predicted by population density and urbanization factors reveals a significant interaction between density and urban centrality, where ‘centrality’ is an indicator of the accessibility of urban goods to rural communities. The results suggest that population density has a strongly positive effect on agricultural intensity in areas with few urban goods and services available, whereas the influence of population density on agricultural intensity is substantially reduced in areas with a greater diversity of urban goods and services.

AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), 0.8-2.5 kg, previously acclimated to full-strength seawater at 8°C, were kept at a density of 540 kg·m-3 water (260 kg·m-3 volume) for 24 h, and thereafter at 1050 kg·m-3 water (540 kg·m-3 volume) for a further 24 h. Mortality and degree of iono-osmoregulatory disturbance were negligible. Simulated transport caused a general stress response, as indicated by an increase in plasma cortisol and glucose levels. No differences were recorded between the fish sampled after 24 h and after 48 h. Oxygen consumption during the first 24 h of simulated transport was the same as that recorded some days later for fish kept at a lower density. There were no differences in muscle and liver glycogen content, or in muscle lactate content of the different groups. The metabolic effects of simulated transport therefore appeared to be moderate. The results indicate that cod can be transported at very high densities provided they receive sufficient supplies of oxygen.

AB  - Badgers are facultatively social, forming large groups at high density. Group-living appears to have high reproductive costs for females, and may lead to increased levels of inbreeding. The extent of female competition for reproduction has been estimated from field data, but knowledge of male reproductive success and the extent of extra-group paternity remains limited. Combining field data with genetic data (16 microsatellite loci), we studied the mating system of 10 badger social groups across 14 years in a high-density population. From 923 badgers, including 425 cubs, we were able to assign maternity to 307 cubs, with both parents assigned to 199 cubs (47%) with 80% confidence, and 14% with 95% confidence. Age had a significant effect on the probability of reproduction, seemingly as a result of a deficit of individuals aged two years and greater than eight years attaining parentage. We estimate that approximately 30% of the female population successfully reproduced in any given year, with a similar proportion of the male population gaining paternity across the same area. While it was known there was a cost to female reproduction in high density populations, it appears that males suffer similar, but not greater, costs. Roughly half of assigned paternity was attributed to extra-group males, the majority of which were from neighbouring social groups. Few successful matings occurred between individuals born in the same social group (22%). The high rate of extra-group mating, previously unquantified, may help reduce inbreeding, potentially making philopatry a less costly strategy.

AB  - In this paper a heuristic approach is taken to the investigation of density effects in population growth when the limiting factor is food resources. Explicit modeling of resource dynamics lets us to distinguish between density effects that are due to the diminution of the available resources, from density effects arising from direct interference among individuals. While species specific growth dynamics should vary extensively, it is possible to postulate some properties of hopefully, general applicability. This work examines the consequences of three postulates: (a) no growth occurs in the absence of resources; (b) the per capita growth rate increases with available resources; and (c) intraspecies interference competition causes the per capita growth rate to decrease as population density increases. Using these three postulates, I have constructed generalized functional description for each type of density dependence. These functions let us examine interspecies competition in class specific terms. The results indicate that intraspecies interference confers significant advantages in interspecies competition for long term occupation of ecological niches.

AB  - Monitoring is an integral part of species conservation. Monitoring programs must take imperfect detection of species into account in order to be reliable. Theory suggests that detection probability may be determined by population size but this relationship has not yet been assessed empirically. Population size is particularly important because it may induce heterogeneity in detection probability and thereby cause bias in estimates of biodiversity. We used a site occupancy model to analyse data from a volunteer-based amphibian monitoring program to assess how well different variables explain variation in detection probability. An index to population size best explained detection probabilities for four out of six species (to avoid circular reasoning, we used the count of individuals at a previous site visit as an index to current population size). The relationship between the population index and detection probability was positive. Commonly used weather variables best explained detection probabilities for two out of six species. Estimates of site occupancy probabilities differed depending on whether the population index was or was not used to model detection probability. The relationship between the population index and detectability has implications for the design of monitoring and species conservation. Most importantly, because many small populations are likely to be overlooked, monitoring programs should be designed in such a way that small populations are not overlooked. The results also imply that methods cannot be standardized in such a way that detection probabilities are constant. As we have shown here, one can easily account for variation in population size in the analysis of data from long-term monitoring programs by using counts of individuals from surveys at the same site in previous years. Accounting for variation in population size is important because it can affect the results of long-term monitoring programs and ultimately the conservation of imperiled species.

AB  - Background Sustainable urban development is an important objective in many cities and countries. Reduction of (the growth in) urban road traffic is generally accepted as an integrated part of sustainable urban development. There is seemingly a relatively widespread consensus on which means are needed in order reduce urban car traffic volumes (physical and fiscal constraints on road traffic, improvements for public transport, walking and cycling, transport reducing spatial planning) (Næss 2001, European Commission 2001, Owens 1995). Many of these mechanisms are not employed to full advantage. On the contrary, in Norway urban road system capacity is undergoing expansion, the pace of development of public transport facilities are not keeping up with improvements in car traffic facilities, development of infrastructure for walking an bicycling is developing slowly, urban sprawl and wrong location of operations are allowed, and car use is rising too. Research question Our research question is: How and why are planners making plans and politicians adopting them, that according to generally accepted scientific understanding of the correlations between urban development (land use development and development of transport systems) and growth in urban car traffic volumes, result in more urban car traffic despite clear aspirations to reduce urban car traffic growth? Methodology I an initiative study, based on literature reviews and case studies, we defined a number of possible explanations or hypothesis that can explain this (Tennøy 2004a); - Conflicting objectives and values - The politicians rationality and the rationality of politics - Lobbying - Institutional and organisational factors - The planners rationality and the rationality of planning - Knowledge and lack of knowledge among important actors - Disagreement/uncertainty on effects of various means - Focus in planning - Use of transport models in urban planning In order to test these hypothesis, and to achieve a deeper understanding, two in depth case studies were carried out, studying how the use of large transport models influences the land use and transport planning and its results (Tennøy 2004b). Later, two surveys were carried out, among politicians and one among land use planners and transport planners, focusing on how these groups see objectives, values and the usefulness and effects of various means for reducing urban road transport (Tennøy 2007, 2005). The ETC paper will discuss explanations to the research questions based on findings in these studies, supplemented by ongoing analysis of in depth interviews with 12 politicians and 18 planning professionals.

AB  - Population aging was one of the most distinctive events of the 20th century and will remain important throughout the 21st century. Initially, a phenomenon of more developed countries, the process has recently become apparent in much of the developing world as well. The shift in age structure associated with population aging has a profound impact on a broad range of economic, political, and social conditions. This report provides an overview of the world population aging process, focusing on five relevant public policy issues. In dealing with the issues, the report notes the course of the aging process, which has not been the same in all countries. There has been considerable variation in timing, levels, and patterns. The report's assessment of the general trends is disaggregated into development regions and major geographic areas whenever possible. There are five chapters: (1) "Demographic Determinants of Population Ageing" examines the worldwide decline in fertility and mortality that underlies population aging; (2) "The Magnitude and Speed of Population Ageing" explores regional differences in the progression of the aging process through analysis of the percentages and growth rates of the older groups of the population; (3) "The Changing Balance between Age Groups" highlights, from various perspectives, the changes in the relative size of the older and younger groups of the population; (4) "A Demographic Profile of the Older Population" draws attention to two important features of the aging process: the progressive aging of the older population itself and its feminization; and (5) "The Socio-Economic Characteristics of the Older Population" focuses on two dimensions that can greatly affect the well-being of older individuals: labor force participation and literacy.

AB  - The relative effects of resource availability and partitioning on animal population density are unresolved yet central to ecology and conservation. Species-depauperate islands offer an intriguing test case. Across 643 lizard populations from around the world, local abundances are one order of magnitude higher on islands than on mainlands, even when controlled for resource availability. On mainlands, predator and competitor richness only weakly correlate with lizard densities. On islands, sharp reductions in predator and competitor richness are the dominant drivers of lizard abundance. Our results demonstrate the dramatic effect insularity has on the interplay between biotic and abiotic control of animal abundances and the heightened sensitivity of island communities to species' losses and gains.

Here I describe the interspecific scaling of population density and body mass among mammalian primary consumers (herbivores, broadly defined). Density is related approximately reciprocally to individual metabolic requirements, indicating that the energy used by the local population of a species in the community is independent of its body size. I suggest that this is a more general rule of community structure

Population density is reported to be inversely related to home range size, but the relationship may be confounded with body weight. We used multiple regression to examine the relationship between population density, body weight, and minimum convex polygon home range size for seven feral hog populations. We found that both population density and bodyweight were significant in predicting home range size. Future research on density - home range relationships should consider body weight as an important covariate.

AB  - Population density varies widely among U.S. metro areas. A simple, static general equilibrium model demonstrates that moderate differences in metro areas' consumption amenities can cause extremely large differences in their population density. Such amenities are more strongly capitalized into housing prices than into wages. Empirical results suggest that amenities do indeed help support high density levels and that amenities are becoming a more important determinant of where people choose to live. Matching the empirical correlation betweenwages and density requires that amenities cause approximately one fifth of the cross-sectional variation in metro population density. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper dealt with the relationships and correlation models of the population density of 5.6 years old Eucalyptus urophylla plantation with its crown width, diamter at breast height(DBH), tree height, individual standing volume, stand volume, wood properties and survital rate. The results showed that the population density remarkably affected DBH, individual standing volume, crown width, live branch height, stand volume and wood fiber width; but not affect tree height, basic density of wood, and length of wood fibers. It had a positive relationship with stand volume, live branch height and wood fibers width, and a negative relationship with DBH, individual standing volume and crown width. In addition, E. urophylla had a wide range of reasonable density. For short-rotation puplwoods, the optimum planting density of E. urophylla is 2000 individuals per hectare.

AB  - We analysed the effects of Quercus crispula acorn abundance on the density dependence of the large Japanese wood mouse Apodemus speciosus using time series data (1992-2007). The data were obtained in a forest in northern Hokkaido, Japan, by live-trapping rodents and directly counting acorns on the ground. Acorn abundance in one year clearly influenced the abundance of wood mice in the following year in all models examined based on the Gompertz and Ricker model; in addition, the abundance of wood mice had effects on the population. Acorn abundance influenced the strength of density dependence (intraspecific competition) of the wood mouse population. When the abundance of acorns was high, density dependence was relaxed, and as a result the equilibrium density at which the population growth rate decreased to zero became higher. Those effects of acorn abundance were regarded as a nonlinear perturbation effect (sensu Royama 1992). The nonlinearity of density dependence was also detected; higher densities had stronger effects on population growth rates.

AB  - Primary neuron cultures are widely used in research due to the ease and usefulness of observing individual cells. Therefore, it is vital to understand how variations in culture conditions may affect neuron physiology. One potential variation for cultured neurons is a change in intracellular transport. As transport is necessary for the normal delivery of organelles, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, it is a logical indicator of a cell's physiology. We test the hypothesis that organelle transport may change with varying in vitro population densities, thus indicating a change in cellular physiology. Using a novel background subtraction imaging method we show that, at 5 days in vitro (DIV), transport of vesicular organelles in embryonic rat spinal cord neurons is positively correlated with cell density. When density increased 6.5-fold, the number of transported organelles increased 2.2 ± 0.3-fold. Intriguingly, this effect was not observable at 3-4 DIV. These results show a significant change in cellular physiology with a relatively small change in plating procedure; this indicates that cells appearing to be morphologically similar, and at the same DIV, may still suffer from a great degree of variability. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Irtually all of the growth in the worlds population for the foreseeable future will take place in the cities and towns of the developing world. Over the next twenty years, most developing countries will for the first time become more urban than rural. The benefits from urbanization cannot be overlooked, but the speed and sheer scale of this transformation present many challenges. A new cast of policy makers is emerging to take up the many responsibilities of urban governanceas many national governments decentralize and devolve their functions, programs in poverty, health, education, and public services are increasingly being deposited in the hands of untested municipal and regional governments. Demographers have been surprisingly slow to devote attention to the implications of the urban transformation. Drawing from a wide variety of data sources, many of them previously inaccessible, Cities Transformed explores the implications of various urban contexts for marriage, fertility, health, schooling, and childrens lives. It should be of interest to all involved in city-level research, policy, planning, and investment decisions.

Hypothetical and real actions are compared in an experimental setting where the subjects are given an offer to leave the experiment in advance by paying a given amount of cash. The results show a weak tendency of positive hypothetical bias in the willingness to pay for value of time, though this effect is not different from zero at conventional significance levels. However, certainty calibration, by using the information from a follow-up question where the subjects are self-stating their preference certainty of their hypothetical choice, provides evidence of a significant positive hypothetical bias for non-certain subjects whereas this bias is eliminated for certain subjects.

AB  - In modern industrialized countries, human birth rates have been declining persistently for decades. In many cases they have now fallen below the replacement threshold. However, unlike in natural populations where population growth is constrained by limited resources, birth rates in modern industrialized countries are negatively correlated with resource availability. Here, declining birth rates in human populations are shown to be a manifestation of density-dependent population growth brought on by socioeconomic development. This is demonstrated by combining empirical power law relations between population size, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, and fertility in a simple theoretical model describing population dynamics in developed countries. For a closed population, the model exhibits growth to a globally stable equilibrium population size, for both national and city populations. A version of the model that is open with respect to immigration and the influence of foreign technology and capital exhibits a good fit to long-term time series data on population size, GDP per capita, and birth rates for the United States, France and Japan.

AB  - This is a report on the demography of the Hadza, a population of East African hunter-gatherers. In it, we describe the results of a census, and our estimation of age structure, survivorship, mean age of women at childbearing, number of live children, total population size and density, and rate of change since 1967. We show that relevant measures fit closely the stable population model North 6 chosen by Dyson to represent Hadza demography in the 1960s. We compare aspects of Hadza demography with surrounding non-Hadza and with the !Kung. Among other things, we find that the Hadza have a higher population density, higher fertility, and a faster population growth rate than do the !Kung. These demographic differences are consistent with our expectations, which were based on differences in the costs and benefits of foraging in the two regions. We also show that Hadza demographic parameters display remarkable consistency over the past 20 years. Since neighboring populations have been encroaching on the area used by the Hadza, and Hadza foragers have been subject to interludes of externally imposed settlement, this consistency is surprising. We discuss some of the implications.

AB  - The statistical behavior of the propagation and curvature terms in the transport equation for flame surface density (FSD) is studied in the context of large eddy simulation (LES) of premixed combustion in the thin reaction zones regime. It is found that the propagation term is strongly influenced by curvature effects on displacement speed, and it is shown that the propagation term can be closed exactly without any additional modelling provided that the surface averaged displacement speed is accurately represented. The FSD curvature term is decomposed into resolved and subgrid contributions and three different model expressions for the resolved curvature term are studied. It is shown that the choice of expression for the resolved curvature term affects the modelling of the subgrid curvature term. This is important since the treatment of the subgrid curvature term involves the largest modelling uncertainties. Following this, it is argued that the most preferable expression for the resolved curvature term is the one which allows for the smallest subgrid contribution and which captures the correct trend of the complete LES-filtered curvature term. Predictions of existing models for the subgrid curvature term are assessed in comparison to values obtained from filtered direct numerical simulation data. It is demonstrated that the local curvature dependence of the LES surface averaged displacement speed plays a significant role in the modelling of both the curvature and propagation terms. A model is proposed which explicitly accounts for this dependence. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - nullCourbage (Youssef). - Évolution démographique et attitudes politiques en Syrie Entre le populationnisme et le souci de modérer la croissance démographique, la politique syrienne de population a hésité. Accroître le nombre des hommes relevait de la volonté d'affirmer le rang d'une nation qui fit les frais de dépeçages territoriaux. Une population plus nombreuse se justifiait, par un rapport favorable des hommes aux ressources. Depuis le recensement de 1970, montrant une croissance démographique beaucoup plus forte que prévu, les planificateurs penchèrent pour une politique démographique implicite : développement économique, accès de la femme à l'école et au marché de l'emploi. Mais malgré les progrès économiques, sociaux et culturels, la fécondité resta très élevée jusqu'en 1986. Sa stabilité au plan national cachait des augmentations partielles importantes chez les femmes de tous les niveaux d'instruction. L'éducation généralisée ne put donc susciter la baisse de fécondité, d'autant plus que les femmes ne pénétrèrent pas le marché de l'emploi. Depuis le milieu des années 80, de nouveaux comportements émergent. La crise du développement, le recul de la production, agricole en particulier, l'apparition d'une économie moins rentière, ont favorisé la diminution de la fécondité, diffuse sur tout le territoire. Les femmes sont plus disposées à offrir leur force de travail. Le surcroît de dépenses dues à la formation de l'enfant, favorise aussi l'émergence de ces nouveaux comportements reproducteurs.\n\nCourbage (Youssef). - Demographic Trends and Political Attitudes in Syria Those responsible for framing population policies in Syria have wavered between pursuing a populationist policy, and a policy of population control. An increasing population means stressing nationhood in a country with a history of dismemberment. A larger population can be justified provided the ratio of people to resources was favourable. But, since the Census of 1970 which showed that population growth was much larger than had been expected, planners have increasingly opted for what, by implication, is a population policy related to economic development and the access of women to education and work. However, fertility remained extremely high up to 1986, in spite of the economic, social, and cultural progress that had been achieved. A stable rate of population growth at the national level concealed significant increases in certain sub-groups in which fertility was high, irrespective of women's educational background. Extended education did not reduce fertility, particularly as women failed to enter the labour market. Since the mid-1980s, new behaviour patterns have emerged. The economic crisis, the fall in production (especially in agriculture) and the emergence of an economy based on work for wages, have contributed to decreasing fertility throughout the country. Women are now more prepared to go to work outside their homes. The additional expenditure on children's schooling has also contributed to this new form of behaviour.\n\nCourbage (Youssef). - Evolución demográfica y actitudes políticas en Siria La politica de población de Siria ha oscilado entre el poblacionismo y la preocupa- ción рог moderar el crecimiento demográfico.

AB  - Abstract By studying the responses of different species to urbanization, it is possible to understand the impact of this type of habitat modification and to explore, more generally, the link between variations in the environment and changes in behaviour. We radio collared 17 badgers Meles meles from six social groups in a 1km2 urban study area in Brighton, UK, where local badger population density was high, and collected data on their ranging behaviour between 2005 and 2007. We aimed to determine how badgers adapt their behaviour to an urban environment and to assess the generality of previously reported differences in the ranging and territorial behaviour of urban and rural badgers. Analysis of habitat preferences and movement patterns suggested that garden habitat was principally used for foraging, while scrub and allotment habitats were important in allowing animals to travel from one part of their range to another. Group and individual home ranges were the smallest so far recorded for badgers (mean 100% minimum convex polygons=9.26 and 4.91�ha, respectively). Individual range size was negatively correlated with the availability of garden habitat, suggesting that the rich food resources provided by gardens enabled ranges to be small. Group ranges were mostly non-contiguous and there was no evidence of territorial scent marking; rather, activity was mainly restricted to areas in the vicinity of main setts. It is clear that badgers can adapt successfully to urban habitats and that this process affects various aspects of their behaviour. However, our high-density population of urban badgers displayed patterns of behaviour that differed not only from those of typical rural badgers, but also in some respects from those of a previously studied low-density urban population. We conclude that generalizations about the effects of urbanization must be made with caution.

AB  - Societies, virtually by definition, are in the business of social reproduction. They maintain institutional forms and cultural patterns more or less intact, though not of course unchanged, as their individual members age and die and the young are acculturated and assume adult roles. Social reproduction also takes place at the family level2014through the social and biological processes entailed in family succession2014 but there the outcomes owe much more to fortuity, to the luck of the draw. Nonetheless, families become adept at doing the best they can with whatever hands they are dealt2014if need be bending the rules, hedging, bluffing, and coercing. How they do so is highly contingent on each society's circumstances and cultural repertoires, but traditionally marriage decisions offered the principal opportunities and held the major potential risks. The case study of family marriage strategies in a village of the French Pyrenees by Pierre Bourdieu, excerpted below, gives an exceptionally lucid and illuminating dissection of this domain of life2014as it had persisted perhaps for centuries and into the 1950s and 1960s. Pierre Bourdieu was born in 1930 in a Béarn village of the Atlantic Pyrenees like that described. He held an appointment at the University of Algiers in the 1950s, during the years of colonial conflict leading up to independence, and his early research was on Algeria. From 1964 he taught at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales and later also at the Collège de France as professor of sociology (succeeding Raymond Aron), and became one of France's most prominent public intellectuals2014exercising an influence that would be virtually unknown among English-speaking sociologists. His major interests, in some respects prefigured in the present study, concerned aspects of cultural reproduction, particularly how educational systems reproduce class and privilege. His major works include Distinction (1979), The Logic of Practice (1980), and The Rules of Art (1992). He died in January 2002 at the age of 71. The case study excerpted below was published as "Les stratégies matrimoniales dans le système de reproduction,"Annales: Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations (Paris), vol. 27, no. 4/5 (1972).

AB  - Problem statement: Rural population density has a very significant independent influence over important demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the world rural communities. Thus, the understanding of rural population density becomes an important issue to be studied. Approach: Using the rural settled areas of Shaqlawa District as a case study, this study seeks to reveal the specific importance of rural population density as an important variable in understanding the socioeconomic characteristics of sparsely settled rural regions, where spares and falling density presents practical and conceptual problems for rural planners. Results and Conclusion: It is obvious that the need of rural areas for socioeconomic development and regeneration along with the need for diversification of their economic base so as to meet the changes is today greater than ever. The motivation behind of this project is based on the fact that during the last few decades the rural settlement in the study area has been dramatically changed. However at the same time there is a realization that certain parts of the rural area have been left behind in development and the authority is currently promoting rural area in order to sustain local economies and to enhance employment and growth.

AB  - We analytically study a system of spinless fermions driven at the boundary with an oscillating chemical potential. Various transport regimes can be observed: At zero driving frequency the particle current through the system is independent of the system's length; at the phase-transition frequency, being equal to the bandwidth, the current decays as n -α with the chain length n, α being either 2 or 3; below the transition the scaling of the current is n -1/2, indicating anomalous transport, while it is exponentially small exp(-n/2ξ) above the transition. Therefore, by a simple change of frequency of the a.c. driving of the system one can vary transport from ballistic, anomalous to insulating.

AB  - The Bureau of the Census listing of geographical coordinates of centroids of all enumeration districts together with population counts from the U. S. 1970 Census of Population was used to contruct via computer five nationwide geographical grids of population density with sector dimensions of 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.1, and 0.25 degrees of latitude and longitude. The entire population of a district was assigned to a grid sector if the coordinates of the district centroid fell within the boundaries of the sector. The sectors were then rank-ordered according to population density, and listings were made of sector population, population density, geographical location, cumulative population, area of sector, and cumulative area. The five sets of data were synthesized into single equations describing population as a function of density in one case and of area in another. From these data it was found, for example, that about 800,000 people live in 19 sectors of 0.01-degree dimensions with a population density of 100,000 people per square mile or greater (nearly all in Manhattan); about 10 million live in 183 sectors of 0.02-degree dimensions with a population density of 23,000 per square mile or greater; and about half of the total U.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between population density and the percentage of teens who electively terminate their pregnancy was the focus of this study. METHODS: The United States population density was determined for each state and each district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) from the 2000 US Census. The United States teenage pregnancy statistics for females aged 15 to 19 years in 1999 and 2000 were obtained from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The main measures were the correlation between population density and teen pregnancy rate or teen abortion rate by state and ACOG district. RESULTS: In 2000 there was no significant correlation between population density and the percentage of teenage females who conceived when analyzed by ACOG district (correlation coefficient r = 0.063, P =.87). In contrast, there was a significant correlation between population density and the percentage of pregnant teens who electively terminated their pregnancy when analyzed by ACOG district (r = 0.85, P =.003). In regions of greatest population density the percentage of pregnant teens who electively terminated was about 50%. In regions of least population density the percentage of pregnant teens who electively terminated was about 25%. Similar results were observed when teen pregnancy and abortion data from 1999 were analyzed. CONCLUSION: In the United States population density is not associated with the percentage of teenage females who become pregnant, but it is positively correlated with the percentage of pregnant teens that electively terminate their pregnancy. In areas of low population density teens who become pregnant may prefer birth to pregnancy termination. Alternatively, the access to pregnancy termination services may be suboptimal for teens in geographic areas with low population density. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate, geography, census area and the distribution of body mass on the mass : density relationship in terrestrial mammal populations. Location The areas covered include most major terrestrial biomes including the tropics, savannas, and temperate forests. Method Data on population density and body mass from 827 populations belonging to 330 different terrestrial mammal species were derived from a review of the literature. Results LOWESS and polynomial regression analysis indicated that the overall mass : density relationship on log-log scales was not linear and that the slope of this relationship behaves differently across the range of body mass. Body mass explained between 37 and 67% of the variability in population density depending upon the dietary category or the biome group. We also developed two multivariate models that can explain up to 65% of the variability in population density in terrestrial mammals. We also tested for a confounding effect of census area on the mass : density relationship on log-log scales in terrestrial mammals. Conclusions Our findings support previous studies suggesting that body mass is a major predictor of the variance in population density in terrestrial mammals. We suggest that the nonlinearity of the mass : density relationship may result from the fact that the overall distribution of body mass is a mixture of distributions across dietary groups and biomes. In contrast to body mass, our results indicate that climatic and geographical factors have a minor effect on population density. Although census area was closely correlated with body mass, body mass was generally a better predictor of population density than was census area.

AB  - Two strategies of home range acquisition by male subadult pine martens (Martes martes) were described from a high-density population inhabiting Białowieża National Park. Four mother-offspring pairs were identified by genetic parentage assignments. Four subadult males showed two different strategies of home range acquisition: dispersal and sedentary. The dispersing males used an area 4-10 times larger than in sedentary subadult males. A sedentary subadult male used his natal area with his mother, and in the following mating season, this male left this area and established a home range that overlapped greatly with another unrelated female near the natal range. A similar high overlap between another subadult male and an unrelated adult female persisted for 3 years. After the death of this female, the male extended his range to overlap slightly with two to four other females. The sedentary strategy adopted by some subadult males may explain the great variation in spacing patterns of solitary mammals.

The maximization principle of density-dependent selection was applied to a class of fitness expressions with explicit recruitment and mortality terms. Three general results were obtained: First, at low population densities, the genetic basis of selection is the difference between the mean recruitment rate and the mean mortality rate. Second, at densities much higher than the equilibrium population size, selection is expected to act to minimize the mean mortality rate. Third, as the population approaches its equilibrium density, selection is predicted to maximize the ratio of the mean recruitment rate to the mean mortality rate.

AB  - Interspecific comparisons of animal population density to body size has been the subject of active research in the last decade, especially for terrestrial animals when considering particular taxa or taxonomic assemblages. Studies of rocky intertidal communities showed that animal population density scales with body size to the -0.77 power. This relation held within local communities representing a broad array of animal taxa and was not affected by a dramatic alteration in the network of between-species interactions, as revealed by two long-term human exclusion experiments.

AB  - If dispersal is prevented, a low-density vole pop~ilntion will increase to unusually high densities. A mouse-proof fence was constructed around a vole population that had already reached high density and both this population and one on :i conircil iirea were live-trapped frorn January 1975 to Novernber 1975. The population on the control renliiined at peak densities. The enclosed population increased to even higher density once lhe hreedingseason had started and had a higher survival rate than the control population. By midsummer the enclosed population had severely overgrazed the vegetation and went into a sharp decline. Dispersal losses from the control were estimated at 32% for males and 31% for femiiles in these high-density populations. Microtus tonwsendii populations thus responded to ;I fence in o manner similar to that ofother species that have been studied. This experiment indicates the inipibriance ofdispersal to population regulation in voles even at peak densities.

AB  - The rationale for this study is to test Durkheim's proposition that the division of labor in a society changes with the change in population size and density of a society in a change framework.  Durkheim (1964) specified that an increase in population size (i.e., social volume) influences a change in the division of labor when there is an increase in density.  The county is the basic unit of analysis. To ensure that a sufficient number of counties were included in the analysis, all counties which had reported crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the years of 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970 were selected.  The total number of counties in the US is 3073 but only 300 counties consistently reported crime data over the time period.  The findings apply only to the 300 counties selected.  The average population of these counties in 1970 was 117,724 and ranged from 202 to 7,032,075.  The population density averaged 147 population per square mile (ppsm) with a range of .2 to 5103 ppsm while the average percent urban was 37.1 with a range of from zero to 99.7.  The division of labor is measured by an index developed by Gibbs and Martin (1962) and modified by Gibbs and Poston (1975)which measures occupational differentiation.  The basic statistical procedure used was regression analysis.  Both zero order correlations and standard partial regression coefficients were computed to test the postulated association between population size, density, urbanization, and the division of labor.  Relationships were examined for 1940-50, 1950-60, 1960-70.  The zero order correlations were inconsistent with Durkheim's proposition.  The correlation between change in population size from 1940-50 and change in the division of labor (DL) 1940-50 were negative.  Similar results occurred with density and urbanization.  The degree of DL in 1940 was positively associated with change in the antecedent variables of population density and urbanization and negatively associated with change in DL.  Comparisons of the variables during 1950-60 indicated a similar pattern.  The 1960-70 comparisons indicated that there is no correlation between change in population size and change in DL and change in urbanization and change in DL.  Change in density was negatively related to DL.  As in the earlier time periods, the level of DL in 1960 was positively related to each of the independent variables.  These data suggest that some interesting things, largely incongruent with Durkheim's postulate are taking place.  The zero order correlations suggest that in all time periods the antecedent variables vary together which is as Durkheim posited, but the division of labor apparently does not increase as the antecedent variables increase.  These findings lend support to the argument that the division of labor may precede rather than follow the ecological changes in a society.  The results of the regression analysis suggest a similar pattern.

AB  - The population size, age-class structure, and movement of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.) (Dictyoptera: Blattidae), were studied in three sewers in Penang, Malaysia, from September 2008 to October 2009. Eighteen to 20 glass-jar traps (two per manhole) were deployed for a 24-h period during each sampling occasion at each sewer. Adults and nymphs were active throughout the study period, with an average monthly trap catch of 57-97 adults and 79-99 nymphs. The mean proportions of adults and nymphs at the three sewers ranged from 0.47 to 0.57. Of the 2177 male and 2717 female cockroaches marked and released over the three sewers, recapture rates were 29.4-45.8 and 30.8-47.0%, respectively. The proportion of marked males and females did not differ significantly from the proportion of recaptured marked males and females. However, the mean number of times a marked female was recaptured was significantly greater than that of males. Of the 783 males and 1,030 females that were marked and recaptured, 19.4 and 24.7%, respectively, had moved between manholes, and significantly more females than males moved between manholes. Of the 406 recaptured marked adults that moved between manholes, 90.4% moved a distance of 2-20 m from their initial release site; one male moved 192 m, the longest distance recorded. Trap catch on each sampling occasion was positively correlated with daily mean temperature. The number of cockroach movements between manholes also was correlated with the mean daily minimum temperature.

AB  - Trapping is commonly used in various pest insect monitoring programs as well as in many ecological field studies. Despite this, the interpretation of trap counts is challenging. Traps are effective at providing relative counts that enable comparisons but are poor at delivering information on the absolute population size. Making better use of trap data is impeded by the lack of a consistent underlying theoretical model. In this paper, we aim to overcome current limitations of trapping methods used in ecological studies through developing a theoretical and methodological framework that enables a direct estimate of populations from trap counts. We regard insect movement as stochastic Brownian motion and use two different mathematical approaches accordingly. We first use individual-based modelling to reproduce trap catch patterns and study the effect of individual movement on observed catch patterns. We then consider a 'mean-field' diffusion model and show that it is capable of revealing the generic relationship between trap catches and population density. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
