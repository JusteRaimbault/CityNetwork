AB  - The study of changes in land cover and land use is emerging as a major focus of global change research. The research is aimed at determining the drivers and processes of land cover change, understanding the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of land use change and providing an assessment of future land use change. Recognizing that satellite remote sensing provides a unique means for mapping and monitoring land cover change, NASA includes a Land-Cover and Land-Use Change (LCLUC) program as an essential element of the Earth Science Enterprise. The NASA satellite systems provide improved tools for the multi-scale monitoring of land-cover change. MODIS instrument provides moderate resolution data in many spectral bands for mapping land cover and snow, and detection and monitoring of fires. Landsat 7 provides high resolution global coverage of the Earth's changing biosphere. The commercial hyper-spatial resolution Ikonos sensor provides information for land-cover characterization on a local scale, assisting in identifying features unresolved by MODIS and Landsat-7. The exploratory mission EO-1 with the imaging spectrometer Hyperion onboard provides new potential for repeated observations and spectrometry analysis of various areas of the globe. This talk will provide examples of how the new data are being used for tackling the science questions formulated in NASA's Earth Science Enterprise strategic plan: 1) what changes are occurring in global land cover and land use, and what are their causes? and 2) what are the consequences of land-cover and land-use change for human societies and the sustainability of ecosystems?

AB  - This paper presents an attempt to model domestic migration within Austria. To this end, we slightly adapted the system dynamics land-use/transport interaction (LUTI) model MARS and set up a nation-wide case study. Particular attention was paid to the estimation of the gravity model parameters. Two alternative\napproaches were implemented: firstly, Poisson regression was applied to derive maximum likelihood estimates. Secondly, the built-in optimizer of the modelling software Vensim was used to estimate parameters by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between observed and predicted migration flows. Both approaches proved practically viable and each one features specific advantages. The optimizer approach obviates the need for external econometric software for parameter estimation; Poisson regression is\nsuperior in terms of significance testing for models and individual parameters. Unfortunetaly, despite the fact that both approaches result in satisfactory model fit, the parameter estimates are quite distinct in some cases.\nFinally, some lines for futher research are indicated.

AB  - This paper takes a historical perspective on how cities have become less sustainable in terms of transport, but it will argue that many positive changes have taken place even before the current concerns over CO2 and oil. There seem to be many more opportunities for further change through the encourage- ment of high-quality city-based lifestyles that do not require high levels of carbon-based mobility. But it is in the newly emerging “megacities” that the main problems occur, as there is a discontinuity between the slow growing, stable, and well- structured cities of the west and the rapidly growing, unstable, and unstructured cities of the east. The debates need to address the role of transport and land-use planning in these megacities that are growing at rates and on a scale that do not reside comfortably in the traditional planning framework. New visionaries are required to confront the problems of megacities, and innovative planning processes are necessary to facilitate rapid and adaptive change so that new urban structures can accommodate growth yet maintain flexibility. A hundred years of knowledge and experience about different forms of transport and urban structure needs to be concentrated into the next 10 years so that these megacities can emerge as the new models for transport and urban sustain- ability.

AB  - Future land-use configurations provide valuable knowledge for policy makers and economic agents, especially under expected environmental changes such as decreasing rainfall or increasing temperatures. This chapter proposes an optimisation approach for modelling land-use change in which landscapes (land uses) are generated through the use of an evolutionary algorithm called GeneticLand. It is designed for a multiobjective function that aims at the minimisation of soil erosion and the maximisation of carbon sequestration, under a set of local restrictions. GeneticLand has been applied to a Mediterranean landscape, located in southern Portugal. The algorithm design and the results obtained show the feasibility of the generated landscapes, the appropriateness of the evolutionary methods to model land-use changes and the spatial characteristics of the landscape solutions that emerge when physical drivers have a major influence on their evolution.

AB  - The common confusion of land cover and land use in many data sets is problematic for many data integration activities. This article proposes an approach for the separation of land cover and land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case, they provide building blocks that allow land cover and land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land cover) and function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land cover and locations where the concepts of use and cover are confused. The separation of land cover and land use facilitates the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

AB  - In spite of the many advances in land use and land cover change modelling over the past decade many challenges remain. One of these challenges relates to the explicit treatment of feedback mechanisms in descriptive models of the land use system. This paper argues for model-based analysis to explore the role of feedback mechanisms as determinants of land use dynamics and system evolution. Different types of feedbacks in the land use system are discussed addressing interactions over scales of analysis, feedbacks between impacts and driving forces of land use change and feedbacks between agents and land units. The inclusion of feedbacks in land use models will require new methods for model parameterization and calibration, but will ultimately increase our understanding of land use system dynamics.

AB  - Regional climate model simulations with RegCM3 were performed to investigate how future land-cover/land-use (LCLU) change in Montane Mainland Southeast Asia (MMSEA) could affect regional climate. Simulation land-surface parameterizations included present day and plausible 2050 land-covers, as well as two extreme deforestation simula- tions. In the simulations, the original land cover map of RegCM3, based on AVHRR 1992– 93 observations, was replaced with one obtained from MODIS 2001 observations; and the model was set to work at two different spatial resolutions using the sub-grid feature of the land surface model: 27.79 km for the atmosphere and 9.26 km for the land surface. During validation, modeled precipitation closely matched observed precipitation over southern China, but underestimated precipitation in the Indochina Peninsula. The plausible 2050 LCLU simulation predicted little change in regional climate. However, an extreme irrigated crop parameterization caused precipitation to increase slightly in the Indochina Peninsula, decrease substantially in southeastern China, and increase significantly in the South China Sea. The extreme short-grass parameterization caused substantial precipitation decreases in MMSEA, but few changes elsewhere. These simulations indicate in order for significant climatological changes to occur, substantially more LCLU conversion is required than the 16 % change we incorporated into the plausible 2050 land-cover scenario.

AB  - This paper presents the 'MEFA toolbox', which is designed to measure society-nature interaction. MEFA stands for 'material and energy flow accounting' and refers to a set of quantitative methods to trace the materials and energy throughput of societies in a way that can be readily linked to established socio-economic data sets on a national and sub-national level. Within the MEFA framework, accounts of socio-economic material and energy stocks and flows can be linked to land use and its impact on material and energy stocks and flows in terrestrial ecosystems. Using Austria 1950-2000 as an empirical example, we demonstrate how MEFA tools can be used to assess the correlation of physical and monetary growth, and we discuss how changes in socio-economic metabolism and land use are related. We also outline some possible future research directions. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concept of land use transition highlights that land use change is non-linear and is associated with other societal and biophysical system changes. A transition in land use is not a fixed pattern, nor is it deterministic. Land use transitions can be caused by negative socio-ecological feedbacks that arise from a depletion of key resources or from socio-economic change and innovation that take place rather independently from the ecological system. Here, we explore whether the sources of land use transitions are mostly endogenous socio-ecological forces or exogenous socio-economic factors. We first review a few generic pathways of forest transition as identified in national case studies, and evaluate the varying ecological quality of expanding forests associated with these pathways. We then discuss possible explanatory frameworks of land use transitions. We use the case of the recent forest transition in Vietnam as an illustration. Socio-ecological feedbacks seem to better explain a slowing down of deforestation and stabilization of forest cover, while exogenous socio-economic factors better account for reforestation. We conclude by discussing the prospects of accelerating land use transitions in tropical forest countries. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The project ILUMASS (Integrated Land-Use Modelling and Transport System Simula- tion) embedded a microscopic dynamic simulation model of urban traffic flows into a comprehensive model system incorporating both changes of land use and the resulting changes in transport demand as well as their environmental impacts. The land use mod- elling is entirely microscopic and includes models of demographic development, resi- dential location, firm life cycles, business relocation and construction of dwellings and non-residential floorspace. To test the land use model the very detailed transport and environment models were temporarily replaced by an aggregate transport model and less detailed environmental impact models. The paper outlines the land use submodels and their integration into the ILUMASS model and presents selected scenario results and concludes with a discussion of the advantages and limits of microsimulation.

AB  - We examine the accessibility benefits associated with some land-use policy strategies for the Netherlands that anticipate on expected climate change. A disaggregate logsum accessibility measure using the Dutch national land-use/transport interaction model TIGRIS XL is used to compute changes in consumer surplus. The measure provides an elegant and convenient solution to measure the full accessibility benefits from land-use and/or transport policies, when discrete choice travel-demand models are available that already produce logsums. It accounts for both changes in generalised transport costs and changes in destination utility, and is thus capable of providing the accessibility benefits from changes in the distribution of activities, due to transport or land-use policies. The case study shows that logsum accessibility benefits from land-use policy strategies can be quite large compared to investment programmes for road and public transport infrastructure, largely due to changes in trip production and destination utility, which are not measured in the standard rule-of-half benefit measure. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land tenure and resource availability can play a critical role in the land use decision-making process, resulting in different types of land use changes. This paper investigates the role of land tenure security and farm household characteristics on land use change in the Prasae Watershed, Thailand, using GIS and farm-level data. Forest conversion to annual crops and subsequently to perennial crops was a typical land use change during 1982-2004. Tenure insecurity is found to be associated with deforestation and forest encroachment. Insecure landholders adopt perennial crops in order to acquire basic land use rights and entitlement to subsequent legal registration, while more secure land tenure is seen to have economic advantages for production and long-term investment. Although land tenure security can act as a crucial factor in land use decision making, farmers opt for different land use options based on characteristics such as farm size and available labor. To advance the economic well-being of insecure and temporary landholders and support forest conservation, this report concludes that an effective policy should aim to improve both farm productivity and land quality while protecting the remaining forest. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the anthropogenic forcing of geomorphic systems, specifically how nineteenth century land-use changes impacted watershed hydrologic, upland erosional, and sediment delivery subsystems of Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. Identification and analysis of the timing and rate of change in these subsystems, and the reestablishment of presettlement conditions, were used to address landscape sensitivity and watershed inheritance issues in a region undergoing population expansion and development. Archival research was used to reconstruct concurrent land-use changes in the catchments of two nineteenth century water-powered mills. Changes in the physical properties of mill pond sediments including, organic content, particle size distribution, and magnetic susceptibility, were used to interpret trends in sediment source during the span of mill operation. Interpolation of augering and coring data was used to determine mill pond sediment mass and pond capacity. Hillslope hydrologic change occurred almost immediately following land conversion. Upland erosion began with the removal of A-horizon fines, and progressed with the removal of A-horizon coarse particulates, and then B-horizon particulates. Change from one source category to another was punctuated by high flow events signifying an integration of human activity and climate in the changing of system boundary conditions

A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - As an open source and modular software system using highly disaggregated data for dynamic simulation, UrbanSim has been instrumental in making integrated land-use transportation modeling accessible beyond the bespoke models that characterized earlier generations. The UrbanSim model and the collaborative OPUS framework (Open Platform for Urban Simulation) that it has spawned have stimulated much original progress in this field. The object of this thematic issue of the Journal of Transport and Land Use is to report on this work and to illustrate the various ways UrbanSim has been adapted. However, this special issue is more than just a collection of progress reports. A central theme running through all the papers is that integrated land use-transportation modeling in Europe presents a series of challenges and demands not necessarily present in the United States context in which UrbanSim was developed. Thus, while the UrbanSim system can be technically adapted to European studies given the data and resources, the prevailing land-use transportation environment in Europe differs from the United States.

AB  - The previous chapters in this Handbook have shown that spatial development, or land use, determines the need for spatial interaction, or transport, but that transport, by the accessibility it provides, also determines spatial development. However, it is difficult to empirically isolate impacts of land use on transport and vice versa because of the multitude of concurrent changes of other factors. This poses a problem if the likely impacts of integrated land-use and transport policies to reduce the demand for travel are to be predicted. There are principally three methods to predict those impacts. The first is to ask people how they would change their location and mobility behaviour if certain factors, such as land use regulations or transport costs, would change ('stated preference'). The second consists of drawing conclusions from observed decision behaviour of people under different conditions on how they would be likely to behave if these factors would change ('revealed preference'). The third method is to simulate human decision behaviour in mathematical models. All three methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Surveys can reveal also subjective factors of location and mobility decisions, however, their respondents can only make conjec- tures about how they would behave in still unknown situations, and the validity of such con- jectures is uncertain. Empirical studies based on observation of behaviour produce detailed and reliable results; these, however, are valid only for existing situations and are therefore not suited for the assessment of novel yet untested policies. In addition it is usually not possible to associate the observed changes of behaviour unequivocally with specific causes, because in reality several determining factors change at the same time. Mathematical models of human behaviour are also based on empirical surveys or observa- tions. The difference is that the conclusions to be drawn from the survey and observation data are quantified. Strictly speaking, the results of mathematical models are no more universally valid than those of empirical studies but are only valid for situations which are similar to those for which their parameters were estimated. Nevertheless it is possible to transfer human be- haviour represented in mathematical models within certain limits to still unknown situations. In addition, mathematical models are the only method by which the effects of individual de- termining factors can be analysed by keeping all other factors fixed. In this chapter recent developments in the field of operational integrated land-use transport models will be reviewed with special emphasis on their ability to test both land use and trans- port policies and to assess their impacts.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of land use change requires robust documentation on the characteristics of change. Land use change observation and monitoring programs now rely on remotely sensed data coupled with field observations and corroborating information describing the social, economic, and physical dimensions of land use and land cover. Remote sensing approaches for observing and monitoring change vary depending on the geographic scope, ecological complexity, and the information required to understand ecosystem interactions. Strategies based on identifying spectral variability are useful for targeting areas of rapid change. Measuring changes in land cover biophysical properties requires a more complex approach, where different dates of remotely sensed data are transformed to such variables as surface imperviousness, canopy structure, and phenology, and then compared. Mapping the conversion of land use and land cover from one category to another (e.g., forest to urban) requires maps of the land use and land cover for two or more periods. These approaches have been used successfully at local, regional, and global scales using a range of remote sensing data (e.g., aerial photography, Landsat Thematic Mapper, Terra MODIS, Space Imaging's IKONOS), field measurements, and other supplemental sources. Challenges remain, however, and scientific advances in change detection methods, accuracy assessment procedures, and improved strategies for using land cover to more specifically infer land use are needed so that continued improvements in the types and quality of change measures used to study land use and ecosystem interactions can be realized.

AB  - Accessibility in public outdoor environments for those with reduced functional capacity has been gaining interest on both the international and national levels. Thiis study investigates how accessibility issues are currently treated in Swedish municipalities in order to examine how the accessibility needs of older people are met in daily practice. A postal questionnaire was sent to all municipalities in Sweden (N=290) with questions mainly regarding three categories: (1) existence of policies & planning documents, cooperation with interest organizations, and measures implemented, (2) awareness and use of governmental directives and recommendations relevant for accessibility issues and (3) statements of how accessibility issues are treated among municipal politicians and employees as perceived by the respondent. In the data analysis, a quantitative ranking of each one of the three categories was created using questions from the questionnaire to indicate the level of accessibility implemented in municipal planning. The results show a large variation in the accessibility standard among the municipalities in Sweden. In municipalities that have planning documents, e.g. accessibility plan, accessibility issues are treated more positively among the municipal politicians and employees. This positive relationship with the treatment of accessibility was also found with factors such as municipalities have an accessibility adviser employed, municipalities cooperate with senior organizations, and municipalities use governmental\ndirectives and recommendations relevant for accessibility issues. This paper concludes that although\nthere is still much to do to accomplish a society accessible to all citizens, a majority of the Swedish municipalities\nare nevertheless positive to accessibility issues.

AB  - A meta-analysis of the Land System Science literature identified that small-scale land uses currently receive little attention in studies seeking to understand land use change dynamics. We conceptualised two ways in which small-scale land uses operate to indirectly drive more extensive land use change: (1) through modifying spatial landscape attributes and (2) through altering underlying forces driving the expansion of other land uses. We then propose the concept of ?intensive land uses?, those that occupy a small proportion of the landscape but indirectly drive land use change dynamics through their operation. Our discussion highlights that, with the exception of roads, we currently underestimate the importance of intensive land uses in the literature and we illustrate this with a case study of a commonly disregarded intensive land use: mining. We conclude that the inclusion or exclusion of land uses from analyses should extend beyond quantifying their land use area and instead incorporate an understanding of how land uses operate within their regional context. Finally, we present three future research opportunities to incorporate intensive land uses into analyses and models of land use change dynamics.

These threats are traced in a conceptual model borrowed from vulnerability studies and detailed in regard to ecosystem responses, including forest structure and composition, above-ground biomass, soil nutrients, balance in species and biotic diversity, and invasive species. The land-use and land-cover changes underway pose trade-offs in ecosystem services and raise several scalar issues important to deforestation studies.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.

In this paper a comprehensive methodology for analysing accessibility impacts and accessibility benefits, which is based on location-based and utility-based accessibility measures within an integrated land-use-transport interaction modelling framework, is described and applied in a case study. The case study examines the accessibility benefits and related user benefits of intensive mixed-use strategies aimed at increasing the density and diversity of activities around railway stations for the Randstad area of the Netherlands for the 1996-2030 period. A heavy concentration of activities near railway stations is shown to result in decreasing marginal returns for public-transport users and disbenefits for car users.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado, a biodiverse savanna ecoregion covering ???1.8 million km2 south and east of the Amazon rainforest, is in rapid decline because of the expansion of modern agriculture. Previous studies of Cerrado land-use and land-cover (LULC) change imply spatial homogeneity, report widely varying rates of land conversion, use ambiguous LULC categories, and generally do not attempt to validate results. This study addresses this gap in the literature by analyzing moderate-resolution, multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data from 1986 to 2002 in two regions with identical underlying drivers. Unsupervised classification by the ISODATA algorithm indicates that Cerrado was converted to agro-pastoral land covers in 31% (3646 km2) of the study region in western Bahia and 24% (3011 km2) of the eastern Mato Grosso study region, while nearly 40% (4688 km2 and 5217 km2, respectively) of each study region remained unchanged. Although aggregate land change is similar, large and contiguous fragments persist in western Bahia, while smaller fragments remain in eastern Mato Grosso. These findings are considered in the current context of Cerrado land-use policy, which is dominated by the conservation set-aside and command-control policy models. The spatial characteristics of Cerrado remnants create considerable obstacles to implement the models; an alternative approach, informed by countryside biogeography, may encourage collaboration between state officials and farmer-landowners toward conservation land-use policies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aimof the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ‘‘land cover classification system’’. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - Forests and woodland cover roughly one-third of the land surface of the world, and therefore deserve serious consideration in assessments of the socioeconomic implications of climate change. This article explores expected sensitivities of the world's managed forests, forest environment and forest sector to future climate change. A variety of studies are summarized. If significant climate changes occur over the next 50-75 years, forests throughout the world will undergo massive adjustments, many of which will in the short term be undesirable. Forest management has high potential for mitigating these effects, but only with support of insightful policy initiatives that take account of potential climatic changes.

AB  - Bioproductive land is one of the most significant natural resources. People use the land for receiving ecological services. This leads to humans using and favouring certain species, while competing with all other species. Land use can create diverse cultural landscapes of outstanding aesthetic, economic and ecological value, but it may equally result in land degradation, soil loss and impoverished ecosystems. Hence land use is shaped by processes of society-nature interaction. These processes can detract from sustainability-in other words, society-nature interaction may deplete the natural capital upon which the provision of ecosystem services for humans depends. Sustainability indicators aim at monitoring key aspects of society-nature interaction in order to generate information needed to document the current state and the history leading up to it. Moreover, they are useful to communicate complex sustainability problems within the scientific community, to policy-makers and the broad public. This paper introduces a special issue that seeks to contribute to the development of sustainability indicators that track society-nature interaction. We focus on a variety of concepts that measure socio-economic metabolism. All the discussed approaches relate socio-economic energy and material flows to the bioproductive area needed to support them, above all, the ecological footprint and the human appropriation of net primary production. In addition, this special issue also analyses the consequences of land use intensity on the diversity, naturalness and patterns of landscapes. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since time immemorial,humans use land to meet their material, social,and cultural needs. In this process, theyare modifyingland resources in various ways,often with detrimental impacts on the environmental and human well-being. Land cover may change under the influence of biophysical conditions only but, most frequantly; itresults from uman-induced land-use change. Land-use and land-cover changeis influenced by a variety of biophysical and societal factoes operating on several spatial and temporal levls, and acting in intricate webs of place- and time-specific relationships. At the levels of the individual land unit, relevant biophysical factors include local climate and weather,topography, bedrock and soil type, surface water, and groundwater. The choice of land use decisions to change it are influeced by the size of the household members,site-specific conditions - accessibility, landesque capital, regional land-use struture - as well as by transportation cost, profits,parcel size, competitio,costs os production, product prices, public and private financial support,land-management practices,land tenure, and ownership. At higher spatial levels, pivotal biophysical influences on land-use and land -cover change include regional climate,landform, geology,soils, hydrology, vegetation, and fauna. Societal factors relating to population struture and dynamics, income and affuence, technology, socio.economic organization, culture,institutions, and political system shape demans for land, lad-use patterns and their change. Future land-use and cover change will depend, on the one hand,on the dynamic relationships among these factors and resulting land-use patterns, from the individual to higher spatial levels and, on the other,on national and international direct and indirect policies instituted to mitigate the adverse environmental and socio-economic impacts of land-use and land-cover.

AB  - This research addresses land use and land cover change and the policies that relate to that change in a Midwestern (USA) watershed. Changes in land use/cover over 20 years were studied, with a primary focus on changing forest cover and its distribution. The hypothesis at the outset was that as urbanized area increased and agricultural area decreased, forested areas would decline. Local land use policies were studied for their impact on changing forest cover. Analyses of land use/cover in the watershed show a significant increase in forest cover, simultaneous with decreased agriculture and increased urban use. However, local land use planning measures for protecting forest and open space land were found to be negligible throughout the watershed. Land use planning at the watershed level is analyzed and a stronger authority at this level is recommended. © 1995.

AB  - The Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia is undergoing some of the most rapid land-cover and land-use changes in the Arctic due to a combination of gas development, reindeer herding, and climate change. Unusual geological conditions (nutrient-poor sands, massive ground ice and extensive landslides) exacerbate the impacts. These changes will likely increase markedly as transportation corridors are built to transport the gas to market. Understanding the nature, extent, causes and consequences (i.e., the cumulative effects) of the past and ongoing rapid changes on the Yamal is important for effective, long-term decision-making and planning. The cumulative effects to vegetation are the focus of this chapter because the plants are a critical component of the Yamal landscape that support the indigenous Nenets people and their reindeer and also protect the underlying ice-rich permafrost from melting. We are using a combination of ground-based studies (a transect of live locations across the Yamal), remote-sensing studies, and analyses of Nenets land-use activities to develop vegetation-change models that can be used to help anticipate future states of the tundra and how those changes might affect traditional reindeer herding practices and the thermal state of the permafrost. This chapter provides an overview of the approach, some early results, and recommendations for expanding the concept of cumulative-effects analysis to include examining the simultaneous and interactive effects of multiple drivers of change.

AB  - Transport systems and land use are two mutually interconnected elements: the location of the activities and their need for interactions produce transport demand; on the other hand, transport supply system supporting transport demand and performance levels of transport services affect the activity locations. In this paper the relationship among the factors affecting transportation and land-use systems interactions was investigated and a GIS was used for exploring the relationship among some spatial variables regarding geographical features, activity location, demographic and economic characteristics, and transportation variables such as trip production and attraction, and accessibility. Analysing the relationship among the variables, unobserved or “latent” variables affecting land-use and transport interactions were identified and introduced in a structural equation model. This approach allows the modelling of a phenomenon by considering both unobserved “latent” constructs and observed indicators describing the phenomenon. The results show that travel behaviour is more influenced by the economic characteristics of population. These analyses allow identifying the relationships among variables related to land use and transportation system, and can provide some findings for transportation planners as well as assisting the complex process of urban planning decision-making.

AB  - Disease emergence events have been documented following several types of land use change. This chapter reviews several health-relevant land use changes recognized today, including: 1) urbanization and urban sprawl; 2) water projects and agricultural development; 3) road construction and deforestation in the tropics; and 4) regeneration of temperate forests. Because habitat or climatic change substantially affects intermediate invertebrate hosts involved in many prevalent diseases, this chapter provides a basic description of vector-borne disease biology as a foundation for analyzing the effects of land use change. Urban sprawl poses health challenges stemming from heat waves exacerbated by the "urban heat island" effect, as well as from water contamination due to expanses of impervious road and concrete surfaces. Dams, irrigation and agricultural development have long been associated with diseases such as schistosomiasis and filariasis. Better management methods are required to address the trade-offs between expanded food production and altered habitats promoting deadly diseases. Deforestation can increase the nature and number of breeding sites for vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and onchocerciasis. Human host and disease vector interaction further increases risk, as can a change in arthropod-vector species composition.

AB  - Land-use change is both a cause and consequence of many biophysical and socioeconomic changes. The CLUMondo model provides an innovative approach for global land-use change modeling to support integrated assessments. Demands for goods and services are, in the model, supplied by a variety of land systems that are characterized by their land cover mosaic, the agricultural management intensity, and livestock. Land system changes are simulated by the model, driven by regional demand for goods and influenced by local factors that either constrain or promote land system conversion. A characteristic of the new model is the endogenous simulation of intensification of agricultural management versus expansion of arable land, and urban versus rural settlements expansion based on land availability in the neighborhood of the location. Model results for the OECD Environmental Outlook scenario show that allocation of increased agricultural production by either management intensification or area expansion varies both among and within world regions, providing useful insight into the land sparing versus land sharing debate. The land system approach allows the inclusion of different types of demand for goods and services from the land system as a driving factor of land system change. Simulation results are compared to observed changes over the 1970-2000 period and projections of other global and regional land change models.

AB  - Land use transport interaction models have been developed in various forms dating back to the early 1960s. They have moved from spatial interaction models or statistical models through econometric models to micro-simulation, cell-based automata and agent-based models. There has been a move towards more detail in representing space and individual behaviour. This paper presents an alternative approach which uses an intentionally developed strategic high-level model. Nevertheless this model still delivers comparable levels of statistical fit in terms of validation but is easy to present to decision makers and planners. The paper introduces the concepts behind the MARS model, deals with validation and transferability between cities and provides example applications.

AB  - Most changes in land use affect the amount of carbon held in vegetation and soil, thereby, either releasing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to, or removing it from, the atmosphere. The greatest fluxes of carbon result from conversion of forests to open lands (and vice versa). Model-based estimates of the flux of carbon attributable to land-use change are highly variable, however, largely as a result of uncertainties in the areas annually affected by different types of land-use change. Uncertain rates of tropical deforestation, for example, account for more than half of the range in estimates of the global carbon flux. Three other factors account for much of the rest of the uncertainty: (1) the initial stocks of carbon in ecosystems affected by land-use change (i.e., spatial heterogeneity), (2) per hectare changes in carbon stocks in response to different types of land-use change, and (3) legacy effects; that is, the time it takes for carbon stocks to equilibrate following a change in land use. For the tropics, recent satellite-based estimates of deforestation are lower than previous estimates and yield calculated carbon emissions from land-use change that are similar to independently-derived estimates of the total net flux for the region. The similarity suggests that changes in land use account for the net flux of carbon from the tropics. For the northern mid-latitudes, the carbon sink attributed to land-use change is less than the sink obtained by other methods, suggesting either an incomplete accounting of land-use change or the importance of other factors in explaining the current carbon sink in that region.

AB  - A strong inter-dependence exists between the decision to develop land and the expected re- turns to be gained from that development. Current practice in UrbanSim modeling treats developer behavior and the emergence of land prices as independent processes. is assumes that land prices are exogenous to the interaction between buyers and sellers—an assumption that is difficult to sustain in ur- ban economics and real estate research.is paper presents an attempt tomodel the two processes as oc- curring simultaneously. Using theUrbanSimmodel for metropolitanTelAviv,we compare the results of forecasts for densities (residential and non-residential) and land values for the period 2001–2020. Our results show that simultaneous estimation tends to produce more accentuated outcomes and volatile trends. e validity of these results and the implications of this approach in the wider context of land use modeling are discussed.

AB  - In this summary chapter, we highlight three over-arching patterns among the ecosystem responses presented by the chapters in this volume. The first pattern is one of altered abundances and fluxes of water, nutrients, energy and species in ecosystems-always taking place initially after land use change, and often evolving and persisting over some extended period of time. A second repeating pattern is that there are clear bioclimatic and edaphic controls over the vulnerability of ecosystems to degradation during land use. A third emergent pattern is that indirect, unintended responses are ubiquitous across all types of land use and represent additional trade-offs in ecosystem services that go well beyond the direct impacts of land use change. Combined, these three patterns provide a conceptual basis upon which to develop a framework for systematic assessment of ecosystem responses to land use and land use change.

AB  - Asia’s densely populated agricultural landscapes are undergoing unprecedented eco- logical changes caused by population growth and adoption of industrial technolo- gies such as fossil fuel and chemical fertilizer. Covering nearly 6 × 106 km2, these landscapes now release more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land and biomass fuel. Measuring ecological processes and their changes in these highly heterogeneous “village landscapes” is made difficult by their very small scale of management, with households typically managing many small plots using a wide variety of inputs and methods. This chapter describes the global extent of village landscapes, characterizes their spatial heterogeneity, establishes appropriate scales for ecological change measurement, and demonstrates methods developed to measure long-term ecological changes across village landscapes in China. Reli- able measurements of ecological change in village landscapes can be made by inte- grating high-resolution (≤1 m) landscape change measurements with household-level resource management data. These methods link local land use practices with regional and local ecological change, potentially aiding land use decision-making, but require far greater research effort than conventional land use measurements based on 30–1000 m resolution imagery and county or provincial data. Therefore, a multi-scale sampling and analysis system was developed to integrate local and regional data for estimating regional change across village landscapes in China. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach in measuring and mediating the impacts of ecological changes in densely populated landscapes are discussed in light of preliminary results indicating that population increase and modernization are increasing carbon seques- tration across these landscapes.

AB  - Two interrelated aspects of land use and transport planning are treated: first, a clear description of the dynamics of land use and transport interaction under a variety of real world controls; and second, the implications of this interaction for policy, planning and policy-sensitive modeling endeavors. Contemporary land use planning, due to its serious shortcomings which result in unstructured growth, is under much public criticism. Empirical observations drawn from Canadian experience elaborate on this issue. The inadequacies of the available development controls, the failure of the market mechanism, a rapidly growing concern for efficiency in resource management, environmental, social, and economic terms clearly indicate that innovative and imaginative policy and planning efforts are needed. Suggestions focusing on land use and transport interaction are made for effective policy, planning and modeling.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aimof the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ‘‘land cover classification system’’. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover change affect the biogeochemistry of stream ecosys- tems in numerous ways, both direct and indirect. Changes result from hydrologic mod- ifications, including direct alterations of flow regimes and hydrologic flowpaths and indirect changes in hydrologic patterns via increased impervious cover in con- tributing areas of watersheds. Direct changes to channel morphology (i.e., reduced complexity) and to floodplains of streams and rivers also influence biogeochemistry, for example, by eliminating surface watergroundwater exchange. The nature of and strength of connections between the stream and its watershed may be altered by large-scale changes such as those brought about by urban and suburban development. Finally, in urban and agricultural areas, elevated nutrient loading is exacerbated by land-cover changes that increase the potential for erosion or overland flow, and decrease the opportunities for nutrient retention. Using comparative analysis based on published work, mined public data, and new research, we evaluate urbanization effects on stream ecosystems in the Sonoran Desert region of central Arizona. Five key characteristics of non-urban desert streamsnitrogen limitation, a flashy hydro- logic regime that initiates succession, extensive groundwatersurface water interaction, episodic terrestrialaquatic interactions, and high capacity for nutrient retention are both dramatically altered and scarcely affected by urbanization. The similarities exhibited by aridland streams and their urban counterparts arise from large-scale con- straints (e.g., episodic terrestrialaquatic interaction is imposed by the climatic regime in both stream types), whereas the differences, like interrupted flowpath continuity in the urban landscape, likely result from the myriad direct modifica- tions of streams and catchment land cover in cities.

AB  - For understanding the causes and effects of changes in land use it is\ncritical to study the interaction between the temporal dynamics and the\nspatial pattern of land use. Interactions arise from feedbacks in the\nhuman-environment system, heterogeneity in the biophysical and human\nenvironment and the influence of land-use history. Land-use simulation\nmodels can serve as a tool to understand these dynamics in more detail\nand assess the impact on ecosystem functioning. This chapter presents a\nspatially explicit modelling approach to explore the spatial and\ntemporal changes in landuse patterns as a function of the specific\ncharacteristics of cropping systems and feedbacks between land use and\nthe environment. A case study for Bac Kan province in northern Vietnam\nis used to test and illustrate the capacity of the model. The results\nindicate that the model can be used to assess changes in land-use\npressure and pattern under different development pathways or scenario\nconditions. The potential of further developing this approach is\ndiscussed.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly.\n\nLonger term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production – offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping – along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production.

AB  - The on-going globalisation and the increasing demand for flexibility in modern businesses have made transport, together with business logistics, a major functional domain. Transport growth is essentially for economic growth but is not without negative impacts. External effects such as pollution, congestion, accidents and damage to infrastructure generate considerable social costs that impose a heavy burden on society. This title addresses the need to develop new freight transport models and scientific tools to provide sound solutions that consider the wide range of internal and external impacts. The international contributions push forward frontiers in freight transport modelling and analysis.

AB  - The semi-arid grasslands in Inner Mongolia (IM) are under increasing stress owing to climate change and rapid socio-economic development in the recent past. We investigated changes in land cover/land use and landscape structure between 1992 and 2004 through the analysis of AVHRR and MODIS derived land cover data. The scale of analysis included the regional level (i. e. the whole of IM) as well as the level of the dominant biomes (i. e. the grassland and desert). We quantified proportional change, rate of change and the changes in class-level landscape metrics using the landscape structure analysis program FRAGSTATS. The dominant land cover types, grassland and barren, 0.47 and 0.27 million km(2), respectively, have increased proportionally. Cropland and urban land use also increased to 0.15 million km(2) and 2197 km(2), respectively. However, the results further indicated increases in both the homogeneity and fragmentation of the landscape. Increasing homogeneity was mainly related to the reduction in minority cover types such as savanna, forests and permanent wetlands and increasing cohesion, aggregation index and clumpy indices. Conversely, increased fragmentation of the landscape was based on the increase in patch density and the interspersion/juxtaposition index (IJI). It is important to note the socio-economic growth in this fragile ecosystem, manifested by an increasing proportion of agricultural and urban land use not just at the regional level but also at the biome level in the context of regional climate change and increasing water stress.

AB  - This report on Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF) is the response to the invitation by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to develop good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). GPG-LULUCF provides supplementary methods and good practice guidance for estimating, measuring, monitoring and reporting on carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, and Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. The GPG-LULUCF assists countries in producing inventories for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector that are neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and in which uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. It supports the development of inventories that are transparent, documented, consistent over time, complete, comparable, assessed for uncertainties, subject to quality control and quality assurance, and efficient in the use of resources. The GPG-LULUCF is consistent with the existing good practice guidance for the other sector and addresses: • \t Choice of estimation method within the context of the IPCC Guidelines; • \t Quality assurance and quality control procedures to provide cross-checks during the inventory compilation; • \t Data and information to be documented, archived and reported to facilitate review and assessment of inventory estimates; • \t Quantification of uncertainties at the source or sink category level and for the inventory as a whole, so that resources available can be directed toward reducing uncertainties over time, and the improvement can be tracked.

AB  - Online (all Chapters)  http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-3-540-77380-1  Once rare, wildfires are becoming increasingly common in the Amazon. For the last several decades, Brazil has worked to settle the Amazon. People have cleared many areas and fragmented much of the remaining forest.  Most regional land uses are fire-derived, fire-managed, or make the remaining forests more vulnerable to fire.   Closed-canopy forests generally remain relatively cool and moist even during the dry season when weeks may pass without rain. However, extreme drought events eventually dry the surface fuels enough to make the forest susceptible to fire. Continual ignition events along forest edges make forest fires inevitable during these periods. Once damaged by either fire or selective logging, the forest canopy becomes fractured, allowing moisture to be rapidly pumped from the forest by small-scale convection cells. These damaged forests dry rapidly and become fire-susceptible nearly every year during the dry season.   Poorly adapted to fire, the forests suffer severe damage and high mortality even during low-intensity fires. Each fire results in an increase in fuel loads from dying and decaying trees. Subsequent fires burn more intensely, spread faster, and can kill even the largest, thickest barked trees.   Therefore, human land use and the ecological traits of the forest combine to make them susceptible to a positive feedback process whereby fires become more frequent and more severe until the forest collapses and is replaced by grass or scrub vegetation.   Ongoing climate change is warming the Amazon and may potentially reduce rainfall or increase drought frequency or intensity. These forests have persisted through many periods of previous climate change.   However, the current conditions of ubiquitous ignitions, extensive clearing, fragmentation, and damage to the forests may combine to make large regions vulnerable to fire conversion of these lush biodiverse ecosystems to early successional and impoverished conditions. Without changes in land and fire management, fire will become endemic to many regions, threatening both the native species and the livelihoods of people who live in the Amazon.

AB  - Accessibility is an essential concept widely used to evaluate the impact of transport and land-use strategies in urban planning and policy making. Accessibility is typically evaluated by using separately a transport model or a land-use model. This paper embeds two accessibility indicators (i.e., potential and adaptive accessibility) in a land use and transport interaction (LUTI) model in order to assess transport policies implementation. The first aim is to define the adaptive accessibility, considering the competition factor at territorial level (e.g. workplaces and workers). The second aim is to identify the optimal implementation scenario of policy measures using potential and adaptive accessibility indicators. The analysis of the results in terms of social welfare and accessibility changes closes the paper. Two transport policy measures are applied in Madrid region: a cordon toll and increase bus frequency. They have been simulated through the MARS model (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator, i.e. LUTI model). An optimisation procedure is performed by MARS for maximizing the value of the objective function in order to find the optimal policy implementation (first best). Both policy measures are evaluated in terms of accessibility. Results show that the introduction of the accessibility indicators (potential and adaptive) influence the optimal value of the toll price and bus frequency level, generating different results in terms of social welfare. Mapping the difference between potential and adaptive accessibility indicator shows that the main changes occur in areas where there is a strong competition among different land-use opportunities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper summarizes land-cover and land-use change at eight sites in Thailand, Yunnan (China), Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos over the last 50 years. Project methodology included incorporating information collected from a combination of semiformal, key informant, and formal household interviews with the development of spatial data-bases based on aerial photographs, satellite images, topographic maps, and GPS data. Results suggest that land use (e.g. swidden cultivation) and land cover (e.g. secondary vegetation) have remained stable and the minor amount of land-use change that has occurred has been a change from swidden to monocultural cash crops. Results suggest that two forces will increasingly determine land-use systems in this region. First, national land tenure policies-the nationalization of forest lands and efforts to increase control over upland resources by central governments-will provide a push factor making it increasingly difficult for farmers to maintain their traditional swidden land-use practices. Second, market pressures-the commercialization of subsistence resources and the substitution of commercial crops for subsistence crops-will provide a pull factor encouraging farmers to engage in new and different forms of commercial agriculture. These results appear to be robust as they come from eight studies conducted over the last decade. But important questions remain in terms of what research protocols are needed, if any, when linking social science data with remotely sensed data for understanding human-environment interactions

And based on the land use change/cover (LUCC) data of Chongqing proper in the year of 1993, 2000, and 200 4, ecosystem service value of the city was calculated. Results show that since 1997 when Chongqing became a municipality directly under the Central Government, large areas of farmland and forest land were alienated for urban construction, causing fall in its urban ecosystem service value by 31.3%, from 564.75 million yuan in 1993 to 387.71 million yuan in 2004. The effect of the changes in the ecosystem service value coefficient on the total urban ecosystem service value of Chongqing is not flexible enough. The impact of the change in water surface and woodland area on the total urban ecosystem service value of Chongqing is significant.

AB  - In the complex agro-ecological conditions of Vietnam's northern borderlands, attempts by ethnic minority farmers to create sustainable livelihoods, along with the impacts of state development policies, have direct consequences for land use and land cover (LULC) change. In this paper we analyse the degree to which LULC has changed and diversified from 1999 to 2009 in Lào Cai Province and the underlying relationships with ethnic minority livelihood diversification strategies. We examine the correlation between LULC diversity and various socioeconomic and biophysical proxies using a spatial autoregressive model. Our findings indicate two major changes in LULC: an increase in closed canopy forest and substantial urban growth. LULC diversity increased between 1999 and 2009, suggesting a transition between land uses and/or a diversification of livelihood strategies. Socioeconomic proxies are significant predictors of LULC diversity in both years, while biophysical proxies are only effective predictors in 2009. In-depth interviews regarding state-led policies and ethnic minority livelihoods reveal some of the underlying mechanisms of such LULC transitions and associations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland.

They are places linked to many destinations in the city by rapid transport. The places in Australian cities which exhibit these qualities of public place are now among the most highly prized - and highly priced.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

Such observations are sparse and unevenly distributed. Use of satellites for such evaluation is therefore attractive. In this study GOES-8 based estimates of land surface temperature (LST) were used to evaluate this parameter. The ability to detect the impact of land cover/land use (LCLU) on the variability in DTR was investigated. A strong dependence on land cover types was found. Moreover, it was observed that when land cover is converted from forests to cropland (deforestation), the DTR increases, while a decrease in DTR is found for agricultural development, like transition from grassland to cropland, and urbanization, such as transition from forests, cropland, grassland to urban. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This paper compares the land use transport interactions in Melbourne, Australia and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The relationship between the urban form and commuters’ travel patterns are analysed and compared. Although these two cities are similar in area and population size, they have significantly different transport systems. Melbourne has a functioning public transport system consisting of train, tram and bus networks, while Riyadh is heavily car-dependent with very limited public transport services. Increases in car ownership and mixed land use on arterial roads in Riyadh create chronic congestion problems on the city's roads. Melbourne also faces these problems, despite good public transport and proper planning controls. This study attempts to identify the land use and socioeconomic determinants of travel patterns. Statistical analyses using Journey to Work (JTW) census data and origin and destination (OD) travel patterns at the suburb level are used to examine relationships between urban form and travel patterns. Comparisons of these relationships help to delineate the role of land use–transport interaction on the travel patterns.^p

AB  - Abstract The area of land used for agriculture in Victoria has probably declined by 15–22% from a peak in the 1940s. There appears to have been two distinct periods of time where the area of land used for agriculture has fallen: the late 1940s, and the 1970s–1980s. The significance of these declines in terms for land use policy is at least twofold. First, they could signal that a transition in land use is occurring that could facilitate revegetation, and potentially also biodiversity conservation. Second, the change could signal that there is a growing area of land held by landowners who are not the traditional targets of natural resource management policy initiatives. This is particularly relevant if the land is in an area where there are critical land management or biodiversity conservation issues. The South West Goulburn subcatchment of the Goulburn–Broken catchment is suggested as a possible example of this type of situation.

AB  - This paper summarizes the literature on spatial filtering (SF) for analysis of spatial data. Given the scarcity of its application in transportation and its fledgling nature, preliminary case studies were conducted using continuous and discrete response data sets, for land values and land use, in comparison with results from spatial autoregressive (SAR) models with distance decay parameters estimated using Bayesian techniques. For both the continuous land value and binary land use cases, the SF approach demonstrates great potential as a worthy competitor to more conventional SAR-based models. In addition to offering high fit statistics, somewhat shorter computing times, and more straightforward computations, the SF approach makes explicit the patterns of spatial dependency in the land value and land use data. By controlling for these spatial relationships, the SF approach yields more reliable marginal effects of policy variables of interest. Model results confirm the important role of transportation access (as quantified using distances to a region's central business district, and various roadway types). ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Studies of land-use change in China have long been hampered by the lack of accurate and reliable data. This research analyzes systematic data on land use gathered in the 1996 survey, the first nation-wide land survey ever conducted in the history of the People's Republic. The actual size of the Chinese territory on the mainland in 1996 was 9.5 million square kilometers, not 9.6 million as generally believed. It took the world's third largest position next to Russia and Canada. Over two-thirds or 67 percent of China's land coverage were devoted to agricultural activities. The bulk of the construction land was widely scattered in the countryside as a result of rural industrialization and urbanization. The 1996 land survey revealed a total cultivated land of 130 million hectares, nearly 40 percent more than what was reported by local cadres to the State Statistical Bureau. Much of the "discovered" farmland was located in the hilly and mountainous regions where the quality of land is low. Cultivated land per capita continued to drop because of the growing population. Only 14 percent of China's land was cultivable and cultivated land per capita was a mere 0.106 ha which was significantly smaller than the world's average of 0.236 ha. A comparison of data for 1949 and 1996 revealed a pattern of land-use change characterized by the expansion of cultivated and construction land at the expense of pasture and unused land subsequent to the environmentally disastrous campaigns of land reclamation. The processes of agricultural restructuring, rural industrialization, and rapid urbanization since the 1990s have given rise to a new trend of massive farmland loss for the benefits of market farming and non-agricultural developments. Newly reclaimed low-graded farmland in environmentally fragile frontier regions has never been able to compensate for the loss of fertile land in the southeastern part of the country where multiple cropping index and population density are high. There is pressing need for China to use its limited land resources most efficiently and effectively for the sake of not only its own growing population but also the globalizing world. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the relations between land-use and socio-economic metabolism and particularly, socio-economic biomass flows, by constructing four scenarios for Austria in 2020. The scenarios were established using a biomass-flow model for Austria which was developed for this analysis. The model distinguishes between 15 different kinds of land use and relates demand for biomass in Austria to biomass production in Austria, considering imports and exports as well as biomass conversions in industrial processing and in livestock. We discuss four scenarios: (1) a trend scenario, based upon an extrapolation of current trends; (2) a scenario assuming the far-reaching liberalization of agricultural markets; (3) a scenario in which biomass utilization for energy and industry is maximized; and (4) a scenario based upon the approach of "cascade utilization" of biomass. We find that increasing the use of biomass as an energy source might have considerable unwanted ecological effects including, among others, a reduction in the functioning of forests as a terrestrial carbon sink. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In most metropolitan areas in Southeast Asia which are rapidly growing, many kinds of urban problems related to land use, transport and the environment are emerging. To improve urban management in the region, a top priority is therefore to strengthen the capacity for planning and policy implementation through better coordination among related agencies. This would be aided by an effective analysis tool for planning with which related agencies could substantially discuss policies and their implementing measures. This paper presents such an analysis system which is a new approach for the integrated planning of land use, transport and the environment in a developing metropolis. It stresses operational and conceptual simplicity as well as flexibility for applicability to developing countries. A prototype system, with Bangkok as the case study area, has been developed within the MS-Windows environment, and it employs an extended version of the Random Utility/Rent-Bidding Analysis (RURBAN) model for activity allocation and transport calculation. The system can also forecast environmental results of changes in land use and transport conditions.

To this end we adapted the existing urban MARS model. The purpose of the model is to capture the most important interactions and feedback mechanisms between the land-use- and the transport system. Particular attention was paid to the structural changes of the model and the estimation of the transport model parameters as well as the land-use model parameters, which are modelled with a gravity model approach. For this purpose we used the build-in optimizer of the modelling software Vensim by minimizing the sum of squared deviations between observed and predicted data. We present the model fit, estimated parameters and results of a first model run (30 years)

AB  - Understanding the interaction between urban land-use change and transport is critical for urban planning as well as for transport planning, particularly in the case of rapidly growing and motorising cities, such as Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. Dynamic land use and transport interaction models provide a good platform to study this mutual interaction. In this paper, we introduce one instance of these models, a cellular automata (CA)-based land-use/transport interaction model (LUTI), which was applied to the quickly growing metropolitan area of Jeddah. The model was calibrated using a stage-wise calibration and evaluated using an independent validation. The CA-based LUTI model outperforms a similar stand-alone CA-based model, which indicates that land use and transport interact and that models for understanding urban dynamics benefit from including the feedback between both systems. Such understanding facilitates the estimation of future dynamics of land-use change and transport in cities, and can support the development of alternative spatial plans and policies. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Several researches have highlighted the fact that travel patterns and therefore fuel consumption and pollutants emissions are strongly related to the land use and the degree of compactness of towns. However, theres no consensus on the fact that policies for sustainable transportation have to focus on the distribution of activities in the urban spaces.

AB  - The water cycle is a vital component of the North Eurasian environment and plays a central role in the region's climate, biology, biogeochemistry and in human interactions with the natural environment. The Northern Eurasian arctic drainage covers more than 2/3 of the pan-arctic land mass. Substantial changes in land cover and land use have occurred over the region in recent decades, as a result of changes in climate, permafrost, and water management, among other factors. These changes are likely to affect large-scale linkages between the regional and global climate system, but the nature of these interactions is not well understood. In this chapter, we analyze changes in the dominant hydrological components and explore the interaction of the terrestrial and atmospheric water cycles, with particular attention to key regional cryospheric processes and linkages between the water and carbon cycles. The monitoring of the water cycle from observational networks and remote sensing along with strategies for improving hydrological change detection are discussed in the context of changes in land cover and land use.

AB  - Grazing systems occupy more of the terrestrial biosphere than any other form of land use, with and and semi-arid regions supporting disproportionately larger grazing area than other biomes. Two common responses of dryland ecosystems to grazing practices are desertification and woody encroachment, with the former occurring in more and zones and the latter becoming prevalent in mesic areas. Desertification and woody encroachment are linked to ecosystem impoverishment and land-use abandonment. Desertification leads to fragmented ecosystem structure and decreased carbon storage. Woody encroachment results in increased structural heterogeneity of the landscape, elevated carbon stores aboveground, and variable belowground carbon responses. Nitrogen accumulates under woody plants in both desertification and woody encroachment scenarios, but large-scale changes in nitrogen stocks and trace gas fluxes differ substantially between these types of land degradation. New remote sensing approaches based on imaging spectroscopy allow regional-scale estimates of carbon and nitrogen dynamics that will increase our understanding of desertification and woody encroachment in global grazing systems.

AB  - n this paper we present the preliminary results of an ongoing study that aims to develop a land cover classification for mainland Portugal based on a multi-stage classification approach using the spectral and temporal pattern analysis of MERIS Level 2 full resolution data. First, our methodol- ogy uses unsupervised classifications and time-series analysis in an intra-annual set of MERIS images, for the production of a 5 class stage one map. In a second stage, supervised classifica- tions were applied for those classes that still could be more specified, producing a final map with 19 land cover classes. In order to apply and test the classification procedures we have used a set of samples collected for the 19 classes. The sampling process was performed by visual interpreta- tion of high spatial resolution Earth Observation data, namely SPOT5-XS images acquired during the year of 2003. The final map has a global accuracy of 79%.

AB  - The book presents recent estimates of the rates in changes of major land classes such as forest, cropland and pasture. Among the causative mechanisms behind land change, synergetic factor combinations are found to be more common than single key factor explanations. Aggregated globally, multiple impacts of local land changes are shown to significantly affect central aspects of Earth System functioning. Innovative developments and applications in the fields of modeling and scenario construction are presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the most pressing implications for the design of appropriate intervention policies, and on new directions and frontiers of research. The edited book synthesizes research achievements by dozens of scientists related to the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP). It summarizes relevant findings on global land-use change which arose from value-adding activities of the LUCC project, starting in 1995 and extending until its termination in October 2005. The main intention is to describe how human modification of land cover became a major driving force of Earth System changes over the past 300 years, a period of most rapid transformations, with fundamental implications for current landscape configurations. In writing this book, current knowledge and understanding is reported on the rates, causes/pathways, impacts, future scenarios/models, policy implications and new research directions in the field of land-use/cover change.

AB  - The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) is a multi-disciplinary, multinational scientific project led by Brazil. LBA researchers seek to understand Amazonia in its global context especially with regard to regional and global climate. Current development activities in Amazonia including deforestation, logging, cattle ranching, and agriculture significantly perturb regional and global carbon budgets and the atmospheric radiation budget through both greenhouse gas inputs and the increase in atmospheric particulates generated by fires. The Brazilian Amazon currently releases about 0.2 Pg-C to the atmosphere each year as a result of net deforestation. Logging and forest fire activity are poorly quantified but certainly increase this amount by more than 10%. Fires associated with land management activities generate smoke that leads to heating of the lower atmosphere, decreases in overall cloudiness, increases in cloud lifetimes, and the suppression of rainfall. There are considerable uncertainties associated with our understanding of smoke effects. Present development trends point to agricultural intensification in the Brazilian Amazon. This intensification and the associated generation of wealth present an opportunity to enhance governance on the frontier and to minimize the damaging effects of fires.

AB  - Concerns over climate change have brought new impetus to the goal of reducing vehicle travel through land-use policy. To determine the degree to which land-use policies are effective in reducing vehicle travel, studies are needed that measure and compare vehicle travel both before and after a land-use policy change. The opening of the first big-box retail store in Davis, California, represented a major change in the retail landscape and an unusual opportunity to study its effect on shopping travel. Surveys of residents' shopping behavior conducted before and after the opening of the store revealed a significant shift in where people shopped and a measurable reduction in overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for shopping. Although the observed change in VMT is specific to the Davis context, the findings support the general proposition that bringing retail destinations closer to residences could help reduce vehicle travel, particularly where the comparable alternatives for the newly introduced store are far away. The study also offers important insights into the challenges of conducting before-and-after studies of the impact of local land-use changes.

AB  - Broad concepts of larger scale regional types of classifications that include management/production patterns- mostly from a policy viewpoint. Landscapes are continually changing as a result of human intervention in natural processes. Both intensive and extensive land uses are expressed in the structure of the land, the size of the parcels and the area of natural and semi-natural vegetation that is present. The task facing ecologists, conservationists, planners, decision-makers and others involved with these changes is to find the best methods for maintaining landscape diversity. Representing an important step forward for regional and inter-regional development of integrated landscape ecological research in the field of land use changes, this volume includes discussion of many problems related to this area. The research papers and case studies featured in Consequences of Land Use Changes were originally presented at a symposium which formed part of the Seventh International Congress on Ecology. Further contributions from this symposium are contained in Landscape Perspectives of Land Use Changes (ISBN: 1-85312-848-1) also published by WIT Press. Noting that the current system of nature conservation areas do not coincide very well with the designated network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest for Europe, landscape ecologists, conservationists, and planners seek optimal ways to maintain landscape diversity. In a section on main concepts, methods, and monitoring, they consider such topics as analyzing the concept of landscape change, reference areas and dimensions in landscape ecology and the application of evaluation functions, and the sensitivity of landscapes to atmospheric pollution. Others look at the consequences of land use changes themselves from such perspectives as the transformation of landscape ecological structure following the land privatization in Hungary since 1989, relationships between farming systems and ecological patterns along a gradient of bocage landscapes, multiple- scale landscape ecological analysis in a rural Mediterranean region, and a conceptual model relating ecological constraints to livestock production in tropical American seasonal savannas.

AB  - The mobility challenges of the developing world are considerably different than those in wealthier, advanced countries, and so are the challenges of coordinating transportation and land use. Rapid population growth, poverty and income disparities, overcrowded urban cores, poorly designed road networks, spatial mismatches between housing and jobs, deteriorating environmental conditions, and economic losses from extreme traffic by congestion are among the more vexing challenges faced by developing cities that could be assuaged through improved coordination of transportation and urban development. This is underscored by examples reviewed in this paper from South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, India, Africa, and South America. It is concluded that whatever is done to improve transportation and land-use integration must be pro-poor. The cardinal features of integrated and sustainable transport and urbanism everywhere---accessible urban activities and safe, attractive walking and cycling environs---are particularly vital to the welfare and prosperity of urbanites in the world's poorest countries.

AB  - Classifies the major cities of the world in 4 types, following J. Michael Thomson, according to their associated land use, transportation and income-level characteristics. No one of these urban archetypes is totally spontaneous. All result from a close and subtle relationship between the provision of transportation facilities and the pattern of land uses and activities, both of which are subject in varying degrees to conscious planning and control. Within limits planners can affect the subsequent pattern of development, making a city resemble rather more one archetype, rather less another one. This particularly applies to the traffic-restrained city, which arises almost entirely from deliberate action. Much of the interest and the difficulty in planning the growth of the world's largest metropolitan areas, therefore, concerns the precise nature and degree of the scope for planned change.-from Author

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

One key problem is the absence of land use data which allows the analysis of land use trends over longer periods of time and with appropriate spatial resolution. This paper asks to what degree CORINE land cover 2000 (CLC 2000) could fill these data gaps. For this purpose, CLC 2000 is compared to other land use data sources.

AB  - The Extractive Reserve System is championed as a win–win model of sustainable development in which rubber tappers serve to protect the forest while improving economic growth and resident well-being. Recently, reserves are being questioned in terms of their environmental sustainability, as many rubber tappers increasingly turn to market agriculture in times of economic duress and instability. This study explores land-use/land-cover change in six rubber estates within the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, using both remote sensing analysis and household surveys, and addresses the differences in deforestation by livelihood trajectories.Aremote sensing analysis between 1986 and 2003 shows that some communities are close to surpassing the allowable limits of deforestation. Rubber tapping plays a less important role in livelihood strategies, as welfare is linked to non-extractive activities. Households pursue diverse livelihood activities including extractivism, small-scale market cultivation, animal rearing, and cattle production. The results suggest that land-use/land-cover change is highly dynamic in the reserve.

AB  - This article investigates land transactions in relation to intended land use change from a micro-scale perspective. A better understanding of land transactions is important for understanding and influencing how land is used. The aim is to explore how the different aspects and their interrelations influence landowner behaviour during land transactions initiated by the government. The study draws on 42 explorative interviews with land purchasers, land policy experts, planning professionals and local farmers. The study shows that uncertainty, and feelings of justice are pivotal aspects during land transactions. Moreover, land transactions are co-evolving with the planning process. Landowners exhibit strategic behaviour based on their personal situation and their expectations on uncertain aspects. The strategies are strongly interrelated with the evolution of land use change. Land use changes are both input on which actors base their strategies, as well as the outcome of those strategies. The aspects found in this study were strongly interrelated and changed over time. Some aspects were context dependent, while others are expected to influence land transactions in general. In this light, the strength of a successful planner is twofold: on the one hand a planner needs to be a good communicator; on the other hand a planner should be able to deal with uncertainty and expectations during plan processes.

This study integrates remote sensing data with social surveys to identify the role of demographic, technology and market-related variables in cropland expansion during economic reforms in Ghana. Macroeconomic changes increased the commercial orientation of farming as the sources of food supply changed from import to domestic production. However interest rates liberalization increased the use of labor at the expense of fertilizer and other complementary inputs. Demographic variables were more important in explaining cropland change after structural adjustment. Public agricultural support services are required for sustainable market-induced agricultural change in Ghana.

AB  - Land use change models are tools for understanding and explaining the causes and consequences of land use dynamics. Recently, new models, combining knowledge and tools from biophysical and socio-economic sciences, have become available. This has resulted in spatially explicit models focussed on patterns of change as well as agent-based models focused on the underlying decision processes. These developments improve the use of land use change models in environmental impact studies. This special issue documents these developments: (i) analysing the system properties in a biophysical and socio-economic context at multiple scales; (ii) integrating spatially explicit land use change models in integrated assessment models; (iii) visualising and quantifying the potential effects of land use change in trade-off curves, to support land users and policy makers in their decisions; and (iv) modelling of the actual decision making process with agent-based modelling. A new promising future development is the incorporation of dynamic feedbacks between changing land use and changing environmental conditions and vice versa. Unfortunately such dynamic feedbacks between the socio-economic and biophysical model components are still not or only partially operational in current models and are therefore the most important challenge for land use and environmental modellers.

Compu- tational performance and development effort were found to be modest, with land use model run times averaging one minute per year on a current desktop computer, and two to three minutes on a current laptop. By contrast, long run times of the travel model suggest that there may be a need to reconsider the level of complexity in the travel model for an integrated land use and transportation model system application to be broadly usable. e land use model is currently in renement, being used to identify input data and model specication adjustments needed in order to bring it into operational use, which is planned over the next several months.

These changes will likely increase markedly as transportation corridors are built to transport the gas to market. Understanding the nature, extent, causes and consequences (i.e., the cumulative effects) of the past and ongoing rapid changes on the Yamal is important for effective, long-term decision-making and planning. The cumulative effects to vegetation are the focus of this chapter because the plants are a critical component of the Yamal landscape that support the indigenous Nenets people and their reindeer and also protect the underlying ice-rich permafrost from melting. We are using a combination of ground-based studies (a transect of five locations across the Yamal), remote-sensing studies, and analyses of Nenets land-use activities to develop vegetation-change models that can be used to help anticipate future states of the tundra and how those changes might affect traditional reindeer herding practices and the thermal state of the permafrost. This chapter provides an overview of the approach, some early results, and recommendations for expanding the concept of cumulative-effects analysis to include examining the simultaneous and interactive effects of multiple drivers of change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Although there are only a limited number of rigorous research papers focussed specifically on land use perceptions, there is an extensive literature on: environmental attitudes in general and urban growth in particular, as well as on the land use perceptions of farmers and on public perceptions about the use of land for the production of food and raw materials. A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact. So the paper concludes with a discussion about future perceptions and possible behavioural change. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - In current practice, transportation planning often ignores the effects of major transportation improvements on land use and the distribution of land use activities, which might affect the accessibility impacts and economic efficiency of the transportation investment strategies. In this paper, we describe the model specification and application of the land use transport interaction model TIGRIS XL for the Netherlands. The TIGRIS XL land-use and transport interaction model can internationally be positioned among the recursive or quasi-dynamic land-use and transport interaction models. The National Model System, the main transport model used in Dutch national transport policy making and evaluation, is fully integrated in the modeling framework. Accessibility modeling and evaluation are disaggregated and fully consistent, which is not common in accessibility modeling research. Logsum accessibility measures estimated by the transport model are used as explanatory variables for the residential and firm location modules and as indicators in policy evaluations, expressing accessibility benefits expressed in monetary terms. Modeling results indicate that accessibility changes from transport investments in the Netherlands have a significant but modest positive influence on the location choice of residents and firms. This is probably mainly due to the spatial structure and already dense and well developed transport networks, and the large influence of national, regional and local governments on the Dutch land use markets. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The book presents recent estimates of the rates in changes of major land classes such as forest, cropland and pasture. Among the causative mechanisms behind land change, synergetic factor combinations are found to be more common than single key factor explanations. Aggregated globally, multiple impacts of local land changes are shown to significantly affect central aspects of Earth System functioning. Innovative developments and applications in the fields of modeling and scenario construction are presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the most pressing implications for the design of appropriate intervention policies, and on new directions and frontiers of research. The edited book synthesizes research achievements by dozens of scientists related to the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP). It summarizes relevant findings on global land-use change which arose from value-adding activities of the LUCC project, starting in 1995 and extending until its termination in October 2005. The main intention is to describe how human modification of land cover became a major driving force of Earth System changes over the past 300 years, a period of most rapid transformations, with fundamental implications for current landscape configurations. In writing this book, current knowledge and understanding is reported on the rates, causes/pathways, impacts, future scenarios/models, policy implications and new research directions in the field of land-use/cover change.

AB  - Of the challenges facing the Earth over the next century, land use and land cover changes are likely to be the most significant. This anthropogenic process affects many parts of the earth’s system (e.g., climate, hydrology), global biodiversity, and the fundamental sustainability of lands. Various estimates indicate that 50 percent of the ice-free land surface has been affected or modified in some way by human activity (Vitousek et al., 1997), while 10 to 55 percent of the net primary productivity has been captured by human land use activities (Rojstaczer et al., 2001). Over the next century, global population is projected to increase by 50-100% and it is likely that there will also be an increase in the global standard of living. Thus pressures to further convert or manage “natural” ecosystems for human needs as well as capturing more of the global net primary productivity are also likely to increase.

AB  - During the last fifty years, urbanization was one of the key processes which altered the European landscape significantly. Currently, the process of population, industry and commerce concentration in the core city changes to a process of de-concentration in the course of suburbanization. This phenomenon known as urban sprawl has recently expanded across most European agglomerations. Urban sprawl takes place on condition of liberal market constraints, thus it is difficult to monitor and cannot be reconciled easily with the urban planning concept of “decentralized concentration”. Hence the dispersion phenomenon of urban patterns is becoming an important topic in applied remote sensing research, as shown in the surveys of Kasanko et al. (2006) and Schwarz (2010). Both studies compare European cities regarding their spatial structure and temporal dynamic on the basis of CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data and in addition with socioeconomic statistics and landscape metrics. In the comparative analysis presented here urban growth modeling is carried out for cities differing in compactness and/or the extent of urban sprawl. The results are compared with the previous work carried out by Kasanko et al. (2006) and Schwarz (2010). Based on CLC data, the urban growth model SLEUTH (Clarke et al., 1998), which is based on the technology of cellular automata, is parameterized for two selective European cities. Cellular automata are able to simulate the complexity and the dynamics of urban systems adequately with quite simple methods. The SLEUTH-model has been applied in multiple studies in particular for North American agglomerations. By applying a modified version of SLEUTH it is possible to reduce the necessary data for calibration from four to two historical land use data sets, which makes the model suitable for the use of CLC data. In detail the following research questions are addressed: 1) how far will the dispersion of selected European cities progress until 2030, 2) how far will a similar trend arrive for presently compact cities, implying “business-as-usual” constraints, and 3) is the application of the SLEUTH urban growth model for European cities as suitable as for North American cities?

AB  - Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of ExceHence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the indirect land use change (ILUC) effects of ethanol production expansion in Brazil through the use of an inter-regional, bottom-up, dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated with the 2005 Brazilian I-O table. A new methodology to deal with ILUC effects is developed, using a transition matrix of land uses calibrated with Agricultural Censuses data. Agriculture and land use are modeled separately in each of 15 Brazilian regions with different agricultural mix. This regional detail captures a good deal of the differences in soil, climate and history that cause particular land to be used for particular purposes.Brazilian land area data distinguish three broad types of agricultural land use, Crop, Pasture, and Plantation Forestry. Between one year and the next the model allows land to move between those categories, or for unused land to convert to one of these three, driven initially by the transition matrix, changing land supply for agriculture between years. The transition matrix shows Markov probabilities that a particular hectare of land used in one year for some use would be in another use next period. These probabilities are modified endogenously in the model according to the average unit rentals of each land type in each region.We ask whether biofuel expansion is consistent with new laws, limiting forest clearing in Brazil. A simulation with ethanol expansion scenario is performed for year 2020, in which land supply is allowed to increase only in states located on the agricultural frontier. Results suggest that each new hectare of sugar cane requires only 0.14. ha of new land, with another 0.47. ha converted from pasture use. Hence policies limiting deforestation are unlikely to prevent greater ethanol production. Finally, regional differences in sugarcane productivity are found to be important elements in ILUC effects of sugar cane expansion. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study proposes a spatial model to examine dynamic interactions among growth, economic geography, the housing market, and public goods in a small, open economic growth model. We emphasize the impact of transport, land and fiscal policy on the spatial economy. The economy consists of the industrial sector, housing sector and local public goods. The model synthesizes the main ideas in the neoclassical growth theory, the Alonso urban model and the Muth housing model within the neoclassical open, small-growth framework. We solve the dynamics of the economic system and simulate the model to demonstrate dynamic interactions among economic growth, the housing market, residential distribution and public goods over time and space. Our simulation demonstrates, for instance, that as the tax rate on land income is increased, the total capital stocks and the stocks employed by the housing and public sectors are increased, the land devoted to local public goods falls and land rents and housing rents rise over space, and the consumption level of industrial goods and the total expenditures on public goods are increased. Our integrating model provides some new insights that cannot be obtained from the component models.

AB  - This is an analysis of the relationships between changes in land use, land cover and socio-economic metabolism in Austria between 1950 and 1995, covering the period during which Austria's agriculture was industrialized. From 1950 to about 1980, Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s, largely through agricultural intensification. Since then, the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction, to preserve the existing farm structure, as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence, since the 1980s yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area. Austria joined the European Union in 1995, after which agricultural policy was, to a large extent, determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy. From 1950 to 1995 we observe a continuous trend of declining cropland and grassland areas, increases in the areas of built-up and infrastructure land, and a slow increase in forested areas. The segregation of cropland cultivation and livestock husbandry leads to a concentration of cropland in fertile lowlands and of grasslands in the lower alpine regions from which crops are retreating. As a result of livestock being fed increasing amounts of cropland produce and imported protein feedstuffs, there was a disintegration of local nutrient cycles and a rising input of mineral fertilizer. We interpret these changes as a consequence of the massive input of fossil energy into Austria's agricultural system, which allowed a surge in the intensification of transport. We analyze these trends using GIS maps based upon statistic data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human use of the land and oceans is at the center of some of the most\ncomplicated and pressing problems faced by policy makers around the\nworld today (e.g., DeFries et al. 2004b; Platt 2004; Millennium Ecosystem\nAssessment 2005). For the terrestrial biosphere, our need to balance\ncurrent human needs and longer-term environmental sustainability\noften involves consideration of the way we use ecosystem goods and\nservices produced by the land. Land-use is at the center of these\ntrade-offs because changes in land use often enhance the share of\nenergy, water and nutrients devoted to human needs but decrease the\nshare available for other species and ecosystem functions. Problems\nas far ranging as improving human health or ensuring adequate food\nproduction cannot be solved unless policy makers understand how their\npolicies alter land use and how altered land use affects ecosystem\nfunctions. For example, public health policy that adequately accounts\nfor the future spread of mosquitoes that carry Plasmodium or malaria\nin the tropics often requires an understanding of the interplay between\nland use and climate (Lines 1995) (see Chap. 4). In China, agricultural\npolicy makers are using a recent assessment of cropland area to create\npolicies that ensure there will be enough land to meet China’s rapidly\ngrowing demand for food, feedgrains, and raw materials that is driven\nby rapid economic growth (Welch and Pannell 1982; Yang and Li 2000;\nHo and Lin 2004; Lin and Ho 2005), although it is not clear that\nother ecosystem services will be maintained in this process.

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role.

AB  - This paper discusses the economic assessment of policies using land use/transport models. It argues that conventional forms of assessment focussing only on transport changes can underestimate the economic benefits of a policy. The paper argues that the benefits need to be measured by the changes of prices at the end of a trip and not just by the changes in travel costs. Models that do not estimate the changes of prices at the end of a trip cannot properly assess the impact of a policy. The model used in this paper is based on the MEPLAN software and estimates the location of households and employment and the interaction between them. It also estimates the cost of living for households and the production costs for employment. With these costs, it is possible to calculate the wider economic benefits beyond transport. The paper illustrates the assessment of policies for the Cambridge sub-region involving investment in public transport, orbital highway and congestion charging policies. The results forecast by the model are assessed in terms of the conventional cost-benefit using traveller's surplus as benefits and compared with a wider assessment measure of compensation variation. It demonstrates that the last measure encompasses the wider benefits associated with transport policies which are not taken into account in conventional cost-benefit analysis. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of the outcomes of this study, the elasticities of mode choice with respect to commuter-transit fees, travel time reductions, and hourly parking costs are estimated. From the results, it is observed that a reduction of 10 percent in the transit fee or relative travel time would increase mode split by 10 percent and 3 percent respectively. eeffect of age on bothmode choice and neighborhood choice is also estimated. eindividual and household structure factors associated with mode choice and/or residential neighborhood choice are also identified.

This loss of croplands was not globally uniform: more than half the worlds population, living in developing nations, lost nearly two-thirds of their per capita cropland base. The distribution of croplands has become increasingly skewedin 1990, 80% of the population lived off less than 0.35 ha/person. While agricultural yields have generally increased, they have barely kept pace with population growth in developing nations. Overall, the global food production system is becoming increasingly vulnerable to regional disruptions because of our increasing reliance on expensive technological options to increase agricultural production, or on global food trade.

AB  - During the last decades Mediterranean systems are being affected by important land use changes which are transforming the entire landscape. Traditional irrigated lands have constituted one of the most characteristic agro-landscapes in the Mediterranean and have played a relevant socio-economic, ecological and environmental role. However, these valuable agro-landscapes are progressively decaying due to recent socio-economic changes which, at the same time, are promoting new irrigated lands outside the river valleys. These new irrigated lands have a major effect on land, water resources, landscape and the biodiversity value of extensive tracts of the Mediterranean area. At the same time, Mediterranean drylands are quickly disappearing due to land abandonment. In addition, Mediterranean areas are suffering a quick urbanisation process affecting both natural and agricultural areas. These trends may be considered as a reduction of the most characteristically rural Mediterranean landscape to favour ecologically extreme landscapes: on one side the natural areas and on the other side the new irrigated lands and urban areas. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the factors driving the land use changes in the Mediterranean, to analyse their ecological effects and to explore the potential implications of several policies regarding land use and natural resources. To this aim, we have analysed the land use changes and their socio-economic and environmental context in three study cases in Southeastern Spain, an arid Mediterranean area where the four above-mentioned land use changes are taking place. These study cases are the traditional irrigated land of Murcia, the agricultural system of Mazarron-Aguilas and the land use changes in the Mar Menor watershed. The ancient Murcia irrigated lands constitutes a paradigmatic example of the loss of this valuable agro-landscape and its highly fertile soils due to the urbanisation process and spread of infrastructures. The Mazarron-Aguilas new irrigated lands may be considered as representative of the most intensive agricultural systems in the Mediterranean area, which are quickly spreading at the expense of drylands and natural areas. The Mar Menor watershed have suffered important agricultural and urban-tourist land use changes affecting the hydrological and nutrient dynamics and the biological communities of the coastal lagoon and associated wetlands. An integrated approach has been applied combining GIS, Remote Sensing, spatial and environmental modelling and dynamic system models to analyse the sustainability of these three case studies, the spatial and temporal patterns of land use, the main socio-economic and environmental driving factors and their ecological implications.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

Epidemiologic studies, however, have produced inconclusive results in humans. A comprehensive review was conducted to assess the current knowledge on tea consumption and risk of cancers in humans. In general, consumption of black tea was not associated with lower risk of cancer. High intake of green tea was consistently associated with reduced risk of upper gastrointestinal tract cancers after sufficient control for confounders. Limited data support a protective effect of green tea on lung and hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Although observational studies do not support a beneficial role of tea intake on prostate cancer risk, phase II clinical trials have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of green tea extract against the progression of prostate pre-malignant lesions. Green tea may exert beneficial effects against mammary carcinogenesis in premenopausal women and recurrence of breast cancer. There is no sufficient evidence that supports a protective role of tea intake on the development of cancers of the colorectum, pancreas, urinary tract, glioma, lymphoma, and leukemia. Future prospective observational studies with biomarkers of exposure and phase III clinical trials are required to provide definitive evidence for the hypothesized beneficial effect of tea consumption on cancer formation in humans.

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - This themed issue of Land Use Policy builds mainly on papers presented at an international conference on 'Land Use Issues and Policy in China under Rapid Rural and Urban Transformation', convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, in October 2012. The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings from a range of disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems due to the nature of the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of this, this themed edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditional empirical land use change models generally assume one average land use decision-maker. Multi-Agent System (MAS) models, on the other hand, acknowledge existence of different types of agents, but their poor empirical embedding remains a serious handicap. This paper demonstrates how agent information can also be incorporated into empirical, biophysical land use models. Agent (farmer) information was captured in four farmer types by means of cluster analysis. The types were distinguished by age, education, property size, distance from residence, and the number of animals owned. This information was made spatially explicit as each field in the study area is related to a farmer, based on cadastral information. Statistical interaction terms between farmer type and landscape factors such as remoteness, soil quality, slope and aspect, were tested for significance in describing the observed occurrence of three land use changes: afforestation of arable land, abandonment of arable land, and restoration of the traditional Montado system. Results showed that each farmer type uses different criteria for selecting land for a certain land use change. For example, absentee farmers abandon the most remote areas while other farmer types do not use remoteness as a criterion for abandonment; active farmers select the most accessible fields for afforestation while other farmer types do not; absentee farmers select their best soils for restoration of the traditional Montado system, while active farmers tend to select poor soils. It is demonstrated that each farmer type shows a different relationship between landscape factors and land use changes. Hence, farmer-specific relationships between landscape and land use contribute significantly to the explanation of land use change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the factors responsible for residential and industrial/commercial land development in Lagos between 1984 and 2000. Land use changes were mapped using satellite images, while binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing urban development as a function of spatially explicit independent variables. Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land area.s. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

The objective of ILUMASS was to implement a fully microscopic model of urban land use, transport, and environment (LTE). Considerable progress was made in developing and testing individual microscopic models and the interfaces between them. However, for several reasons, the planned application of the full model system for the simulation of policy scenarios was not achieved. Possible reasons for this failure are analyzed and recommendations are made to improve future interdisciplinary projects of this kind.

AB  - Policymakers are increasingly asking questions about the wider impacts\nof transport policy, expanding consideration beyond the transport system\nto include land use and the larger economic system. Integrated transport\nland use economic models support this trend, recasting travel and\ntransport as by-products of economic activities and representing the\nconnections between transport policy and economic impacts in a spatial\ncontext. As such, they help in addressing complex policy questions that\nmodels with a more limited transportation-only scope of representation -\nfrom the oldest traditional 4-step models to the latest tour-based\nmicrosimulations - cannot address, at least not well. This paper\nhighlights some of the support provided by integrated models, based on\napplications of the Oregon TRANUS and Sacramento MEPLAN and PECAS\nintegrated models.

AB  - We are exploring ways to capture the temporal and spatial dimensions of the use of public transit. Specifically, we are investigating how different land uses affect the spatial and temporal demand for public transit services. Spatially, the availability of new data collection technology in public transit allows us to examine transit demand at the individual stop level. Our hypothesis, however, is that transit users' activity may not be originated from or destined to an individual stop per se; rather, the activity is associated with a specific location in the vicinity of the stop, and this location may be "covered" by several adjacent transit stops. More importantly, understanding the transit demand at this aggregate level (an aggregate "catchment" area) can enhance the ability to define a specific land-use type and the temporal characteristics related to passengers' activities. Temporally, we seek to understand the relationship between the demand for public transit service at specific times of the day and the associated land uses that may strongly influence the timing of that demand. To explore these dimensions, this study: 1) proposes a method of stop aggregation; 2) generates transit service areas based on these aggregated stops; 3) develops a set of metrics to better represent land-use types within these service areas; and 4) examines the spatial and temporal characteristics of transit demand for these service areas. These methods are applied to a case study using land-use and transit demand data from the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area.

AB  - Provision of recreational open space is a major factor in determining resident quality of life in cities. However, urban growth and land use change models typically omit park location and allocation issues when simulating changing urban environments. This paper introduces a method for exploring the spatial allocation of urban parks (public, recreational open spaces) given differing municipal and county investment decisions. Park planning literature has established level of service metrics as rough indicators of provision of public park amenities that are useful guides for future park investment decisions within a given jurisdiction. In this study, we create a dynamic-demand location model that simulates political feedback from population growth and LOS metrics to allocate new parklands (similar to 0.5 ha <= neighborhood parks <= similar to 4 ha) in multi-jurisdictional urbanizing regions. We frame parks as a new development type that augments residential development currently driving a version of the Regional Urban Growth (RUG) urban simulation model, an open source, raster-based simulation platform. Our approach allows planners and researchers to explore urban patterns and distributive outcomes associated with different local open space requirements and investment choices. We illustrate this approach under scenarios for the rapidly growing, three-county Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region of North Carolina, USA. We test varying delays in park planning, purchase, and construction, varying maximum park sizes, and the effects of increased investment levels in two jurisdictions within our study area. This model suggests that the most important aspect of successful park planning is the length of the lag time between residential and park development. Perhaps the most successful park planning strategy is to plan parks along with residential areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rural land-use in the European Union (EU) is strongly influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) because it directly affects the relative profitability of different land-use options. Since 2000, the CAP has been heavily reformed. In particular, in Sweden, the 2003 CAP reform was followed by substantial shifts in agricultural land allocation. However, this land-use change has barely been studied empirically beyond the net changes of land-use categories. In order to better understand the transformation of the land-use system, all transitions between land-use categories and changes within existing categories need to be considered. This article presents an analysis of agricultural land-use change between 2002 and 2010 in a landscape in southern Sweden. The inter-category land transitions were identified and quantified by using a spatially explicit field-level resolution dataset. The intra-category change of utilization intensity was assessed for grasslands by using standard yields and forage consumption estimates. Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands. The grassland utilization analysis showed a growing gap between grassland area and forage consumption. These results indicate concentration of agricultural production to better quality land and a growing number of land-idling farms in the region. The CAP single farm payment scheme is discussed in the light of these findings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the key activities of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project has been to stimulate the syntheses of knowledge of land-use/cover change processes, and in particular to advance understanding of the causes of land change (see Chap. 1). Such efforts have generally followed one of two approaches: broad scale cross-sectional analyses (cross-national statistical comparisons, mainly); and detailed case studies at the local scale. The LUCC project applied a middle path that combines the richness of indepth case studies with the power of generalization gained from larger samples, thus drawing upon the strengths of both approaches. In particular, systematic comparative analyses of published case studies on landuse dynamics have helped to improve our knowledge about causes of land-use change. Principally, two methods exist for comparative analyses of case studies. These methods are sufficiently broad geographically to support generalization, but at a scale fine enough to capture complexity and variability across space and time.

AB  - Transit-oriented development (TOD) is one of the most popular means of public intervention in the field of spatial planning, which aims at reducing land consumption caused by urban sprawl. In this paper, a logit model is computed to assess whether the Municipal Master Plans approved during the 1990s in the Lisbon region (Portugal), currently in force, contemplated public transit stations as a relevant requirement for the location of the planned urban expansion areas and, more specifically, for the conversion of non-urban areas to artificialized areas. It is shown that TOD was not taken as a preferential approach, suggesting that there may be at the outset an inherent resistance to public injunctions on limiting land-use conversion, regardless of other obstacles frequently mentioned.

AB  - In recent decades, the mixing of complementary land uses has become an increasingly important goal in transportation and land use planning. Land uses mix has been shown to be an influential factor in travel behavior (mode choice and distance traveled), improved health outcomes, and neighborhood-level quality of life. However, quantifying the extent to which a given area is mixed-use has proven difficult. Much of the existing research on the mixing of land uses has focused on the presence and proportion of different uses as opposed to the extent to which they actually interact with one another. This study proposes a new measure of land use mix, a land use interaction method—which accounts for the extent to which complementary land uses adjoin one another—using only basic land use data. After mapping and analyzing the results, several statistical models are built to show the relationship between this new measure and reported travel behavior.  The models presented show the usefulness of the approach by significantly improving the model fit in comparison to a commonly-used land use mix index, while controlling for socio-demographic and built form factors in three large Canadian cities (Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal). Our results suggest that simple, area-based, measures of land use mix do not adequately capture the subtleties of land use mix. The degree to which an area shows fine-grained patterns of land use is shown to be more highly correlated with behavior outcomes than indices based solely on the proportions of land use categories.

AB  - Land-use change has been associated with changes in the dynamics of infectious disease in West Africa. Here we describe the complex interactions of land-use change with three diseases (both vector- and non-vector-bome) of considerable public health significance in this region, namely, malaria and irrigation; epidemic meningitis and land degradation; onchocerciasis and deforestation. We highlight the confounding effect of climate variability, which acts as a driver of both land-use change and human health. We conclude, as have others, that the scale of observation always matters, and complex and dynamic feedbacks among social-ecological systems are not easily teased apart. We suggest that in order to establish the causal chain of interactions between land-use change and human health outcomes two approaches are necessary. The first is to have a thorough understanding of the aetiology of disease and the specific mechanisms by which land-use and climate variability affect the transmission of pathogens. This is achieved by focused, detailed studies encompassing a wide range of potential drivers, which are inevitably small scale and often cover short time periods. The second consists of large-scale studies of statistical associations between transmission indices or health outcomes and environmental variables stratified by known ecological or socio-economic confounders, and sufficient in size to overcome local biases in results. Such research activities need to be designed to inform each other if we are to develop predictive models for monitoring these diseases and to develop integrated programs for human health and sustainable land use.

The nature of this relationship is examined in terms of empirical evidence, and a set of criteria against which the models can be evaluated is defined. Four major types of model are examined: regression, mathematical programming, aggregate spatial interaction and individual choice. Each type is considered in terms of operational examples and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach are identified. However, it is recognized that few of the models are capable of representing the major social and technological changes that are currently influencing urban development, and that this is where emphasis should be put if this type of model is to be useful for policy?making in the future.

AB  - Green Belt policies have helped to create chaotic landscapes at the rural-urban interfaces of the United Kingdom's largest cities. Their prime functions, to control urban sprawl and preserve an encircling green girdle to separate the urban from the open countryside, have created 'edgelands' that have been remarkably dynamic despite relatively strong controls on certain types of development. A detailed case study of one part of London's Metropolitan Green Belt, drawing upon analysis of planning registers, reveals long-term trends in land-use change linked to the development controls operated within the context of the Green Belt and the adjacent built-up area. This paper also outlines the history of the Green Belt policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and discusses recently proposed policy changes that have provoked ongoing debate about this form of control on urban sprawl and its consequences for the land use of Green Belts and the edgelands. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper develops two new models and evaluates the impact of using different weight matrices on parameter estimates and inference in three distinct spatial specifications for discrete response. These specifications rely on a conventional, sparse, inverse-distance weight matrix for a spatial auto-regressive probit (SARP), a spatial autoregressive approach where the weight matrix includes an endogenous distance-decay parameter (SARPα), and a matrix exponential spatial specification for probit (MESSP). These are applied in a binary choice setting using both simulated data and parcel-level land-use data. Parameters of all models are estimated using Bayesian methods.\n\nIn simulated tests, adding a distance-decay parameter term to the spatial weight matrix improved the quality of estimation and inference, as reflected by a lower deviance information criteriaon (DIC) value, but the added sampling loop required to estimate the distance-decay parameter substantially increased computing times. In contrast, the MESSP model’s obvious advantage is its fast computing time, thanks to elimination of a log-determinant calculation for the weight matrix. In the model tests using actual land-use data, the MESSP approach emerged as the clear winner, in terms of fit and computing times. Results from all three models offer consistent interpretation of parameter estimates, with locations farther away from the regional central business district (CBD) and closer to roadways being more prone to (mostly residential) development (as expected). Again, the MESSP model offered the greatest computing-time savings benefits, but all three specifications yielded similar marginal effects estimates, showing how a focus on the spatial interactions and net (direct plus indirect) effects across observational units is more important than a focus on slope-parameter estimates when properly analyzing spatial data.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the main drivers of many environmental change processes. It influences the basic resources of land use, including the soil. Its impact on soil often occurs so creepingly that land managers hardly contemplate initiating ameliorative or counterbalance measures. Poor land management has degraded vast amounts of land, reduced our ability to produce enough food, and is a major threat to rural livelihoods in many developing countries. To date, there has been no single unifying volume that addresses the multifaceted impacts of land use on soils. This book has responded to this challenge by bringing together renowned academics and policy experts to analyze the patterns, driving factors and proximate causes, and the socioeconomic impacts of soil degradation. Policy measures to prevent irreversible degradation and rehabilitate degraded soils are also identified.

AB  - Although the automobile is the least energy-efficient, the least space-efficient, and one of the most expensive of the transport modes to operate, it has dominated our cities for the last 50 years and impaired their quality in fundamental ways. Increasing dependence on the automobile has led to such problems as severe traffic congestion, widespread air and noise pollution, increased fuel consumption, steeper infrastructure costs, and higher accident rates. Through an insidious process, this automobile domination has also encouraged the widespread development of sprawling suburbs that are the most uneconomical, environmentally degrading, and socially deplorable patterns of residential land-use development. It is demonstrated that these adverse consequences, created as a direct or indirect result of the automobile, have impaired the systemicity of the land-use/transport system, representing a modern-day example of the “tragedy of the commons.” To demonstrate whether the systemicity of land-use/transport systems can be appraised, a methodology is outlined for helping planning organizations to become cognizant of these problems and to spur major technological, policy, and behavioral changes.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP &quot;land cover classification system&quot;. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional. The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research projects.

AB  - Several land-based policy options are discussed within the current quest for feasible climate change mitigation options, among them the creation and conservation of forest carbon sinks through mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation also called REDD+ and the substitution of fossil fuels through biofuels, as legislated in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. While those two policy processes face several methodological challenges, there is one issue that both processes encounter: the displacement of land use and the related emissions, which is referred to as carbon leakage in the context of emissions accounting, and indirect land-use change also called ILUC within the bioenergy realm. The debates surrounding carbon leakage and indirect land-use change issues run in parallel but are rather isolated from each other, without much interaction. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences as well as common challenges within these parallel debates by the use of peer-reviewed articles and reports, with a focus on approaches to address and methods to quantify emissions at national and international scale. The aim is to assess the potential to use synergies and learn from the two debates to optimize climate benefits. The results show that the similarities are many, while the differences between carbon leakage and ILUC are found in the actual commodity at stake and to some degree in the policy forum in which the debate is taken. The geographical scale, actors and parties involved also play a role. Both processes operate under the same theoretical assumption and face the same problem of lacking methods to quantify the emissions caused by international displacement. The approach to international displacement is one of the main differences; while US and EU biofuel policymakers acknowledge uncertainties in ILUC accounting but strive to reduce them, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change excludes accounting for international carbon leakage. Potential explanations behind these differences lie in the liability issue and the underlying accounting principles of producer responsibility for carbon leakage and consumer responsibility for ILUC. This is also reflected on the level of lobby activities, where ILUC has reached greater public and policy interest than carbon leakage. Finally, a possible way forward for international leakage accounting in future climate treaties could be the adoption of accounting methods taking a consumer perspective, to be used alongside the existing set-up, which could improve climate integrity of land-based policies. ?? 2013 .

Much of the exist-ing research geared toward improving these instruments has a technical focus on adjusting the intrinsic workings of the instruments themselves. However, the way in which they are embedded in planning practice has remained largely ignored and poorly understood. Based on data from a web-based survey administered to land use and transport practitioners in the spring of 2007, this paper describes how LUT instruments are embedded in planning practice and how they are perceived by the planning actors in land use and transport planning. ăe đndings suggest that a technical focus is insufficient to improve the implementation of these instruments. ăe key bottlenecks, identiđed by the survey, actually are cen-tered on “soĕer issues,” such as lack of transparency and poor connections to the planning process. ăe closing analysis and discussion offer some potential remedies for these shortcomings.

AB  - Although performance measures encourage agreement in other disciplines, measures for state transportation and land use may engender disagreement among stakeholders. A literature review and a survey of 25 states and three metropolitan planning organizations identified 41 such measures.  No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.  Further, when measures are computed under four benevolent scenarios that each generate the support of some stakeholders (reduced transit costs, reduced congestion, increased local autonomy, and increased compact development) some performance  measures indicate improvement and others do not.

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, encompassed by a water- shed extending 168,000 km2 over portions of six states and Washington, D.C. Restoration of the Bay has been the focus of a two-decade regional partnership of local, state and fed- eral agencies, including a network of scientists, politicians and activists interacting through various committees, working groups, and advisory panels. The effectiveness of the restora- tion effort has been mixed, with both notable successes and failures. The overall health of the Bay has not declined since the restoration was initiated in 1983, but many of the advances have been offset by the pressure of increasing population and exurban sprawl across the watershed. The needs of the Chesapeake Bay Program are many, but the greatest is accurate information on land cover and land use change, primarily to assess the implications for water quality, examine various restoration scenarios, and calibrate spatial models of the urbanization process. We report here on a number of new land cover and land use data prod- ucts, and associated applications to assist vulnerability assessment, integrated ecosystem analysis, and ultimately Bay restoration. We provide brief overviews of applications to model new residential development, assess losses and vulnerability of resource lands, and identify the factors that disrupt the health of streams in small watersheds. These data products and approaches are being applied by a number of agencies involved with the restoration effort, including the Chesapeake Bay Program’s activities focused on living resources, water qual- ity, and sound land use.

AB  - Recent changes in land use for tourism and recreation have been driven by socio-demographic shifts, increases in disposable time and incomes, technological changes, transport developments, and emerging systems of policy and governance. Combined with changes in consumption preferences, these have led to general but differentiated increases in tourism and recreation. Outbound tourism has grown more rapidly than inbound, which has led to some displacement of land use demands. In the case of recreation, there are shifts between at home and outdoor recreation, and changes in the content and location of each. The resulting land use trends can be understood in regional, intra-regional (urban versus rural versus coastal) and temporal terms. Future trends are considered in terms of how this broad set of drivers and the relationships between them are being and are likely to be transformed. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

Biodiversity, a term that has entered into common usage only in the last twenty years, refers to the diversity of life at all levels of organization, from genetic to species to ecosystem (Levin 2000). Although we refer throughout this chapter most commonly to species diversity, land use change alters biodiversity at all of these levels. For example, reduced habitat from land use change decreases population sizes and reduces genetic diversity within a species.

AB  - Based on surveys on rural land-use change at village scale in Yucheng City, Shandong province, this paper presents how land-use change takes place in response to inhibitive institutional forces in light of an outmoded land ownership system and unreasonable land use rights administration, and discusses it in the broader social context of industrialization, rural depopulation, a dual-track land market, and land use legislation. Spatial comparison of land use maps interpreted from aerial photographs in different period unveils a decrease in arable land for farming, and an increase in rural settlements, facilities land and unused land. Despite rural depopulation, rural settlements area nearly tripled during 1967-2008. Nearly all newly gained non-agricultural land originated from farmland at the village fringe while formerly facilities land and unused land had been converted to residential use and it was abandoned later. Thus, the destructive farmland conversion from productive use to non-agricultural uses took place at multiple stages. Questionnaire survey of 1650 households in 48 villages in Yucheng City indicated that 41% of the households had multiple dwellings, even though some of them are not occupied or even ruined. This finding may damp the rosy picture of the reportedly slowdown in China's farmland reduction in recent years as these destructive changes are too small to detect from satellite imagery, and it will also provide a practical scientific basis for constituting more strict farmland protection objectives and strategies for China in the near future. In order to hold back the destructive conversion trend from farmland to non-agricultural uses, the authors argue that policy and institution innovation concerning land use and urban-rural development in China needs feature highly in the government's agenda. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - People alter the landscape primarily to appropriate ecosystem goods such as foods fiber, and timber for human consumption. Unintended consequences for ecosystems vary according to the type of land-use change, e.g., forest clearing for agriculture, grassland conversion for grazing, or urban expansion, as well as the underlying ecological characteristics, e.g., humid vs. dry, phosphorus vs. nitrogen-limited, or tropical vs. temperate. The ecosystem responses potentially alter future abilities to provide ecosystem goods and influence future land-use decisions. This volume addresses five major ecosystem responses to land-use change: hydrological, climiatic, biogeochemical, human health, and biological diversity. The chapters summarize current knowledge from the perspectives of different disciplines and present analyses from many parts of the world in different ecological and socioeconomic settings. This introductory chapter develops a framework for understanding and communicating the multiple ecosystem responses as an essential input to societal decisions about land use.

AB  - Atmospheric aerosols have been hypothesized as playing an important role in significant climate and environmental changes that have been occurring in the Arctic. This Chapter concentrates on the role of Arctic aerosols in the energy balance and the hydrological cycle by considering several major aerosol types (sulfates, black carbon and dust) that originate in Northern Eurasia. Aerosols can affect the energy balance directly by scattering, absorbing, and emitting atmospheric radiation as well as by changing the surface albedo. Furthermore, aerosols perturb the radiative energy balance indirectly by affecting the properties, lifetime, and coverage of clouds. Aerosol-induced changes in clouds are also important in the hydrological cycle. An additional complexity arises from the potential connection of aerosols to feedbacks that involve the physical climate, ecological, and human components of the Arctic system. The abundances, chemical composition and spatiotemporal distributions of natural and anthropogenic aerosols, which are controlled by sources and ageing processes occurring during atmospheric transport, are the major factors governing the aerosol climate forcing. Over the past decades, the warming climate, socio-economic changes and changes in land cover and land use occurring in Northern Eurasia have been affecting sources and properties of atmospheric aerosols. These changes were likely to affect not only aerosol burden in the Russian Arctic but through the whole Arctic. Understanding how changes in land cover and land use have been affecting the abundances and distributions of natural and anthropogenic aerosols and how the aerosol-induced varying forcing has been affecting the Arctic climate system is of great importance to understand the overall response of the Arctic region to global warming associated with steadily increasing greenhouse gases.

AB  - Urbanisation is arguably the most significant form of land use change as it has various impacts on the pattern, functionality and dynamics of landscapes. Such effects become particularly obvious if observed and analysed along an urban-to-rural gradient. This article presents a case study on long-term land use and impervious cover change along the urban-to-rural gradient in the German city of Leipzig – a special case because the urban region underwent dramatic societal changes during the past 100 years experiencing both world wars, socialism and transition to market economy. To depict this development we use small scale land use data based on topographic maps from 1870 to 2006. The results show that urbanisation is a strongly non-linear process. In summary, we found the urban-to-rural gradient had a strong tendency to decrease with regard to the percentage of impervious cover with a simultaneous increase of the total impervious cover. This trend is strengthened further by the fact that Leipzig has been growing little in terms of economy and population but rather experienced some form of de-densification in recent decades. The urban-to-rural gradient offers a promising approach to firstly integrate historical data into current land use change impact assessment and, secondly, to uncover effects of iterative and simultaneous phases of urban growth and decline.

AB  - Land-use and transport systems are an important determinant of carbon dioxide emissions from urban regions. It is often asserted that urban compaction is the spatial policy best able to constrain travel and emissions, but evidence supporting this assertion is limited, particularly with respect to the combined emission from transport and land use. Here, using land-use - transport interaction models, a residential dwelling type model, and transport and emission models, we forecast and assess carbon dioxide emissions from transport, dwellings, and commercial space to 2031 for a range of spatial strategies realistically investigated for three English regions of decreasing size (the Wider South East region, Tyne and Wear, and Cambridge). Our results reveal that compaction can reduce emission relative to other spatial scenarios but that the differences are small, about 5% between extremes, an order of magnitude less than emission growth observed over the trend period. Form has more influence for settlements where the pattern and proximity of employment, housing, and services can make cycling, walking, and public transport provision more feasible. We conclude that pricing and technology measures offer better prospects for combating the growth in carbon emissions of urban regions, but that the type of urban form delivered is likely to be a significant determinant in the type of clean energy technology that can be implemented.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB  - Eastern Mau is an important water catchment area for lake Nakuru drainage basin. It has great potential for agricultural development as manifested by the high yields of wheat, barley and dairy products from the few remaining large scale farms. This area was once covered by rich vegetation of highland evergreen forests which extended from the Mau hills and turned into woodland dominated by acacia trees in the Rongai-Njoro plains. Remote sensing techniques and ground survey methods were used to evaluate the land cover /land use change that occurred in the area over a period of about 40 years since 1964. A significant change of land use from forest to agriculture was evident from the interpreted results of the photos taken in 1964 and 1969, the SPOT image of 1987, the Landsat image of 1989 and the ground survey of 2003. Deforestation, land fragmentation, cultivation of wetlands and rapid increase in human settlements have had negative impacts on water resources resulting in reduced stream flows and ground water. Land use has changed from planted forests and large scale farms of wheat, barley, and dairy to homesteads, kitchen gardens and small farms of maize, beans, potatoes and vegetables with some people keeping one or two dairy animals. Currently, studies show increasing land degradation in the area. Sheet and rill erosion is observed when it rains and gullies are beginning to develop along some of the farm tracks. To contain the situation, satellite remote sensing was used to monitor and provide data that can be used to evaluate and manage land use and land use change for sustainable development in Mau East.

As an advanced developing city-state, Singapore has been having the same experience. This paper explores the role of the industrial land market in the changing process of Singapore's manufacturing. In the background of land scarcity and rapid growth, it is found that changing price movements in the industrial property, formulated within the framework of industrial land use policy, have affected the manufacturing groupings unevenly and have thus led to structural changes in the use of industrial land and premises. Thus, the general trend of rising land costs has contributed, to some extent, to the restructuring of Singapore's manufacturing. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to simulate the location of land-use change, specifically forest disturbance, in Costa Rica over several decades. This paper presents a GIS-based model, GEOMOD2, which quantifies factors associated with land-use, and simulates the spatial pattern of land-use forward and backward in time. GEOMOD2 reads rasterized maps of land-use and other biogeophysical attributes to determine empirically the attributes of land that humans tend to use. Then GEOMOD2 uses the patterns of those biogeophysical attributes to simulate the spatial pattern of land-use change. GEOMOD2 can select locations for land-use change according to any of three decision rules based on (1) nearest neighbors, (2) stratification by political sub-region, and/or (3) the pattern of biogeophysical attributes. GEOMOD2 simulates the progressive loss of closed-canopy forest in Costa Rica for 1940, 1961 and 1983, which are the years for which maps of land-use are available. Also, GEOMOD2 extrapolates the pattern of land-use to the year 2010. When GEOMOD2 extrapolates land-use change over several decades, it is able to classify correctly between 74 and 88% of the grid cells, for two categories: forest versus non-forest. Over various simulation runs, Kappa ranges from 0.31 to 0.53. The model’s ability to predict the location of disturbance is best when the model is driven by the location of biogeophysical characteristics, most importantly lifezones.

Various estimates indicate that 50 percent of the ice-free\nland surface has been affected or modified in some way by human activity\n(Vitousek et al., 1997), while 10 to 55 percent of the net primary\nproductivity has been captured by human land use activities (Rojstaczer\net al., 2001). Over the next century, global population is projected\nto increase by 50-100% and it is likely that there will also be an\nincrease in the global standard of living. Thus pressures to further\nconvert or manage natural ecosystems for human needs as well as capturing\nmore of the global net primary productivity are also likely to increase.\nUnderstanding of the patterns of land use and land cover change has\nincreased significantly over the last decade (e.g., Turner 2002a).\nThis has been facilitated in part by increased awareness of the issues\nand by the large number of focused studies directed to understanding\nthe nature of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC). These studies\nhave made significant advances in furthering our understanding of\nthe socio-economic drivers of LCLUC, the impacts on natural and human\nsystems, as well as feedbacks between natural and human systems.\nGiven the large number of case studies that have been performed,\nwe now have the opportunity to look broadly at the results of these\nstudies to assess if there are fundamental patterns of land-use and\nland-cover change that consistently appear regardless of global location,\nsocial organization, economic state, etc. Furthermore, we can now\nassess whether there are persistent impacts of LCLUC that can be\nidentified and related to the overall patterns.

AB  - The objective of the EU research project PROPOLIS (Planning and Research of Policies for Land Use and Transport for Increasing Urban Sustainability) was to assess urban strategies and to demonstrate their long-term effects in European cities. To reach this goal, a comprehensive framework of methodologies including integrated land-use, transport and environmental models as well as indicator, evaluation and presentation systems was developed. Sustainable development is viewed as comprising the environmental, socio-cultural and economic dimension. Thirty-five indicators were defined to measure the three dimensions of sustainability, such as air pollution, consumption of natural resources, quality of open space, population exposure to air pollution and noise, equity and opportunities and economic benefits from transport and land use. Indicator values are derived from state-of-the-art urban land-use and transport models. A number of additional modules, including a justice evaluation module, an economic evaluation module and a GIS-based raster module, were developed and integrated to provide further indicator values. Both multicriteria and cost-benefit analysis methods are used to consistently evaluate the impacts of the policies. The environmental and social dimensions of sustainability are measured using multicriteria analysis for the evaluation of the indicators, whereas cost-benefit analysis is used for the economic dimension. The modelling and evaluation system was implemented in seven European urban regions: Bilbao (Spain), Brussels (Belgium), Dortmund (Germany), Helsinki (Finland), Inverness (Scotland), Naples (Italy) and Vicenza (Italy). A large number of policies were tested with the modelling and evaluation system in the seven urban regions. Policies investigated are land use policies, transport infrastructure policies, transport regulation and pricing policies and combinations of these. Besides a common set of policies examined in all seven urban regions, also city-specific local policies were assessed in each urban region. The first part of the paper introduces the methodology and the model system developed. A particular focus is on the development of indicators describing urban sustainability derived from different indicator modules in the modelling system. The second part presents selected aggregated results of the policy testing and evaluation for Dortmund as one of the seven urban regions. The paper concludes with recommendations on how successful strategies to enhance the long-term sustainability of urban regions should look like.

AB  - Various alternative frameworks are available for modelling urban land-use transport interaction. This paper provides a detailed review of six of these frameworks that have been or are currently being used to develop operational models. The intention is to indicate what is the general nature of the current state of practice and what is now available for practical modelling work in the area. The intention is also to compare the current state of practice with what might be the ideal in various respects. The six frameworks reviewed (ITLUP, MEPLAN, TRANUS, MUSSA, NYMTC-LUM and UrbanSim) are considered in terms of their representations of physical systems, decision-makers and processes, along with various more general modelling and implementation issues. None matches the ideal as envisaged here in all respects. However, a wide range of policy considerations can be handled explicitly with what is available, and more recent developments show an encouraging trend towards expansion in the scope of what can be considered. Further strengthening of the behavioural basis and relaxation of some of the more restrictive assumptions would appear to be both appropriate and likely in the future.

AB  - This is an analysis of the relationships between changes in land use, land cover and socio-economic metabolism in Austria between 1950 and 1995, covering the period during which Austria's agriculture was industrialized. From 1950 to about 1980, Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s, largely through agricultural intensification. Since then, the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction, to preserve the existing farm structure, as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence, since the 1980s yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area. Austria joined the European Union in 1995, after which agricultural policy was, to a large extent, determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy. From 1950 to 1995 we observe a continuous trend of declining cropland and grassland areas, increases in the areas of built-up and infrastructure land, and a slow increase in forested areas. The segregation of cropland cultivation and livestock husbandry leads to a concentration of cropland in fertile lowlands and of grasslands in the lower alpine regions from which crops are retreating. As a result of livestock being fed increasing amounts of cropland produce and imported protein feedstuffs, there was a disintegration of local nutrient cycles and a rising input of mineral fertilizer. We interpret these changes as a consequence of the massive input of fossil energy into Austria's agricultural system, which allowed a surge in the intensification of transport. We analyze these trends using GIS maps based upon statistic data.
