AB  - This paper describes the development of a model architecture based on systems dynamics and econometrics. The purpose of the system of models is to simulate the medium- and long-term effects of urban transport policies with reference to sustainable travel. Three models are presented successively with some results from simulation. The first model relates to the regulation of public transport finance and allows for the constraint of the scarcity of public funds. The second is a modal split model based on price-time modelling. The third is a combined assignment and time of departure choice model based on a queuing representation of congestion. Finally, the coupling between the last two models is described.

AB  - The detected traffic data for single point or link cannot satisfy the needs for network-level traffic status information with the rapid development of the traffic control and guidance systems. This paper proposed a modeling and clustering method for network-level urban traffic status based on the dynamic traffic flow assignment ratios. The traffic assignment ratio matrix model integrates traffic status, topology and relation between links, with the dynamic traffic assignment ratios estimated by Linear Programming. The network-level traffic status is clustered by Self-Organizing Map and the typical patterns are discovered. The experiment proves the efficiency and applicability of this method for network-level traffic status modeling and analyzing.

AB  -  Large-scale urban modeling technologies use a variety of sensors and data acquisition techniques. The authors categorize current approaches and describe their advantages and disadvantages. Their survey examines current research with respect to several performance criteria including data acquisition sources, user interaction level, geometric fidelity, model completeness, and intended applications. Although modeling systems vary with respect to these criteria, data acquisition strongly influences model characteristics and usefulness. We therefore cluster the methods into those based on photogrammetry, active sensors, and hybrid sensor systems.

AB  - This study proposes a method to create an urban planning support model, applying the Environment and energy Geographical Information System Database (E-GIS DB) through the urban life cycle to reduce energy use for environmentally friendly urban planning. The results deduced from this study are organized as follows.The proposed E-GIS construction model is composed of (a) an urban GIS integration model, (b) an E-GIS DB model, and (c) a visualization model. The urban GIS integration model has the ability to integrate urban GIS constructs as well as to connect and visualize urban planning and the environment and energy DB in 3D space. The E-GIS DB model includes a function to visualize the 2D and 3D information, which is used in the environment and energy planning of a city.To validate the proposed E-GIS construction model, a Korean city undergoing the urban planning process is selected as a case study. An E-GIS DB section with an 8. km. ×. 12. km area for the research subject area was constructed in 2D and 3D GIS, and the urban space, climate elements, and energy distribution characteristics are compared. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Previous work has presented our ongoing efforts to define a “reference semantics” for the UML, that is, a mathematically defined system model that is envisaged to cover all of the UML eventually, and that also carefully avoids the introduction of any unwarranted restric- tions or biases. Due to the use of underspecification, the system model is not executable. This paper shows how the system model can serve as the basis for a highly customizable execution and simulation environment for the UML. The design and implementation of a prototype of such an en- vironment is described and its use for the experimentation with different semantic variation points is illustrated.

After an overview of current CC adaptation approaches, it describes the two asset adaptation framework components; first, an asset vulnerability analytical framework that appraises the vulnerability groups most affected by CC-related disasters, and second, an asset adaptation operational framework that identifies CC strategies at individual, household and community level in four phases of long-term resilience; pre-disaster damage limitation; immediate post-disaster response; and rebuilding. It concludes by describing its associated methodology. The paper aims to assist CC researchers and those supporting the poor protect and rebuild assets during CC-related disaster processes.

AB  - While Jay W. Forrester's book Urban Dynamics has received considerable attention since its publication in mid-1969, very little has been done to apply the computer model which that book describes to an actual city. This thesis summarizes the beginnings of what may become the first large-scale effort to refine and apply the Urban Dynamics model to help meet the problems of a real urban setting. A three-month preliminary study in the city of Lowell, Massachusetts has developed strong official support for an expanded effort to develop an Urban Dynamics-type modeling process which can become an ongoing element of the city's long run policy and decision-making system. The city of Lowell—its history and its current socio-economic structure —contains strong parallels to Forrester's general theory of urban behavior. Lowell has experienced a life-cycle which clearly reflects a period of exponential-type growth followed by a peak near 1920, and a subsequent decay to a less healthy condition. Many of the factors which have apparently influenced Lowell's current troubles are also suggested in Urban Dynamics. Parameter modifications, made on the basis of current Census and other data, have generated model behavior which resembles the city in nearly all important general respects. Resulting in a good approximation of the city's past and, more important, a high degree of accuracy in describing the city's present employment, housing, and population characteristics, these modifications have increased our confidence in the model's potential utility. The model's general framework provides an understanding of Lowell's urban system which points to some potential errors in present city policy, and some directions for change. To improve the quality of analysis, to allow precision in problem definition and resolution, will require substantially more work. This thesis is intended as a sunLnary of the origins and a focus for the future of a promising new method of diagnosing and treating our most severe urban ills. Thesis Supervisor: Jay W.

AB  - The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model is a coupled general circulation model, designed primarily for millennial-scale climate simulations and palaeoclimate research. Mk3L includes components which describe the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface, and combines computational efficiency with a stable and realistic control climatology. This paper describes the model physics and software, analyses the control climatology, and evaluates the ability of the model to simulate the modern climate. Mk3L incorporates a spectral atmospheric general circulation model, a z-coordinate ocean general circulation model, a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model and a land surface scheme with static vegetation. The source code is highly portable, and has no dependence upon proprietary software. The model distribution is freely available to the research community. A 1000-yr climate simulation can be completed in around one-and-a-half months on a typical desktop computer, with greater throughput being possible on high-performance computing facilities. Mk3L produces realistic simulations of the larger-scale features of the modern climate, although with some biases on the regional scale. The model also produces reasonable representations of the leading modes of internal climate variability in both the tropics and extratropics. The control state of the model exhibits a high degree of stability, with only a weak cooling trend on millennial timescales. Ongoing development work aims to improve the model climatology and transform Mk3L into a comprehensive earth system model.

AB  - We present a new version of the coupled Earth system model GEOCLIM. The new release, GEOCLIM reloaded (v 1.0), links the existing atmosphere and weathering modules to a novel, temporally and spatially resolved model of the global ocean circulation, which provides a physical framework for a mechanistic description of the marine biogeochemical dynamics of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and oxygen. The ocean model is also coupled to a fully formulated, vertically resolved diagenetic model. GEOCLIM reloaded is thus a unique tool to investigate the short- and long-term feedbacks between climatic conditions, continental inputs, ocean biogeochemical dynamics and diagenesis. A complete and detailed description of the resulting Earth system model and its new features is first provided. The performance of GEOCLIM reloaded is then evaluated by comparing steady-state simulation under present-day conditions with a comprehensive set of oceanic data and existing global estimates of bio-element cycling in the pelagic and benthic compartments.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Classic paradigm of scientific modeling is mainly based on a set of previously, accepted or assumed theories about the target phenomena and a validation procedure by limited observations. Therefore, normally data has a supporting role in the modeling process. On the other hand, recent advances in computing technology have brought us a data deluge that may change the classic paradigm of scientific modeling. Information flows and data streams have reached a level of maturity that they can play the main role in modeling of the real systems, without relying on lots of assumptions and rules in the first step. This turn may cause an inversion in the concept of modeling as a rational process. The proposed theoretical idea in this work is that traditional theory-driven models have a theoretical limit in modeling complex systems, known as curse of dimensionality and further, to highlight the fact that massive urban data streams can open up a new data-driven modeling approach, which goes beyond simple data driven analytics or eye catching info-graphics toward operational models of complex phenomena. In this work we describe a conceptual framework for modeling city wide traffic dynamics that proposes a way to encapsulate the complexity based on abstraction power of Markov chains in a coexistence with continuous data streams. Therefore, finally as an experimental set up, we applied the proposed model to a real data set, consisting of GPS traces of taxi cabs in Beijing and the results have been explained.

Green space network begins to be recognized as a medium of conserving ecosystem and natural environment in urban area. Several methods have been introduced in regards to formulation of modeling urban green space network. This research paper reviews several methods that are used for modeling green space network in urban planning. Recently, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) are being used to produce a model of urban green space network which positively afford nature conservation in city. A study upon various methods of modeling urban green space network which include remote sensing, GIS application through land suitability analysis (LSA) and least-cost path analysis, graph theory and gravity model are initially reviewed to give some understanding to be used for future planning.

AB  - The Praxitele project is responsible for the design of a new kind
of transportation in an urban environment, which consists of a fleet of
electric public cars. The realization of such a project requires
experimentations with the behaviour of autonomous vehicles in the urban
environment. It was necessary to design a virtual urban environment in
which simulations could be done. Reproducing the real traffic of a city
as completely as possible, implies the simulation of autonomous entities
like living beings. Such entities are able to perceive their
environment, to communicate with other creatures and to execute some
actions either on themselves or on their environment. Interactions
between an object and its environment are, most of the time, very
simple: sensors and actuators are reduced to minimal capabilities which
permit them only to avoid obstacles in a 2D or 3D world. This is due to
the fact that databases for virtual environments are often confined to
the geometric level, when they must also contain physical, topological
and semantic information. Accordingly, we propose a model which is
designed to connect different levels of representation, by assembling
geometric, topological and semantic data in the field of traffic
simulation, and its implementation in VUEMS, a Modelling System of Urban
Road Network. From real world data (when available), we construct a
model of the virtual urban environment, integrating all the information
needed to describe the realistic behaviour of car drivers and
pedestrians

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - A condensed history of urban modeling is presented to alert the reader to the vast literature that exists on the subject and to place Forrester's Urban Dynamics model in perspective. The influence of the export and service concept is found to be pervasive. With the changing context for urban analysis, the major issues appear to have shifted from that of how to accommodate growth through land allocation process. Among the higher priority issues are concerns with equity and environmental quality, the increasing complexity in client-sponsor relations, the need for better policies for operations as well as investments, and the design of meaningful information systems. To complement the other papers in this special issue, suggestions are made to modify or augment urban dynamics by the use of subjective probabilities; the use of empirical feedback to reduce uncertainties and imperfection of knowledge in urban system behavior; the inclusion of explicit values in the construction of a diversity of urban models used together in a gaming process; and the consideration of projecting structural changes in the urban model as a function of changes in values, institutions, and technology.

AB  - Urban street patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and detail-independent mechanism may be in action.We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggest that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follows a simple universal mechanism.

AB  - ssung The TRNSYS (TRaNsient SYstems Simulations) Hybrid Lighting Model was revised so that two colorimetric indices pertinent to indoor illumination, the correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI), could be predicted by the model. For calculation of the CCT and CRI relevant to the hybrid lighting system, the spectral power density (SPD) of beam normal radiation was needed. Though TRNSYS provides algorithms to calculate the magnitude of beam normal radiation on any surface, no methods were provided in TRNSYS to determine the SPD of solar radiation. This thesis describes the inclusion of a spectral model in TRNSYS: Gueymard's SMARTS2 (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) algorithm. This algorithm was used to calculate the SPD of beam normal radiation as a function of solar position, atmospheric turbidity, moisture content, and other atmospheric parameters. The TRNSYS hybrid lighting model, augmented by SMARTS2, was used to analyze building illumination and energy loads for a 2500 m2 office building equipped with a hybrid lighting system (HLS). The HLS uses two-axis tracking collectors to collect beam normal radiation that is later divided into visible and infrared components. The visible radiation is piped to luminaires inside the building using optical fibers, while the infrared radiation is focused on thermal photovoltaic arrays and used to generate electricity. The TRNSYS model calculated annual building energy loads (lighting, cooling, and heating) and energy savings in office buildings located in six U.S. cities: Honolulu, HI; Tucson, AZ; Reno, NV; Atlanta, GA; Seattle, WA; and Madison, WI; that were equipped with hybrid lighting systems. Using local utility rates and assuming 52 lm/W lamps efficacies (the commercial average in the U.S.), the annual energy savings per m2 collector area in these cities were: $240-Tucson, $140-Reno, $320-Honolulu, $40- Atlanta, $50-Madison, and $60-Seattle. For the colorimetry analysis, four representative lamp SPDs - warm white fluorescent, full spectrum fluorescent, tungsten incandescent, and halogen incandescent - were defined as standard indoor light source spectrums. Two cities were chosen to perform the analyses in: Tucson, which represented a clear climate with consistent beam normal radiation values, and Seattle, a cloudier climate. The CCT and CRI were calculated each hour during office working hours. When cloudy, the CCT and CRI of the illumination inside took on the values of the lamp providing it, but when beam normal radiation was available these values were influenced by the 5000-5500 K CCT and 80 CRI of the beam normal radiation transmitted though the HLS. Histograms showing the number of hours at varying CCT and CRI ranges for different locations and with different lamps are presented in Chapter 7.

AB  - There is a lack of information on the environmental effects of urban change and the dynamics of greenspace. Such informa- tion is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. We therefore investigated the changes in land use and land cover of 11 residential areas in Merseyside, UK, using aerial pho- tographs taken in 1975 and 2000.We then modeled howthese changeswould alter three important environmental parameters: surface temperature, runoff of rainfall, and greenspace diversity. These changes were then related to the socio-economic status of the areas, as measured by an index of multiple deprivation. The comparisons revealed a loss of greenspace in all 11 case study sites Overall, the more affluent, low density areas lost more greenspace, especially of tree cover. A major cause was infill development whereby gardens were built over. However, greenspace was also lost in already densely built-up, deprived areas due to the reuse of derelict land. As a consequence, the models used in this study predicted negative environmental impacts for all areas. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts such as urban densification and give more weight to the preservation and management of urban greenspaces.

AB  - Development has ended isolation in many parts of Kalimantan, Indonesia, and provides previously isolated communities with the opportunity for greater involvement in a market economy. This paper describes the use of a simulation model to study the possible impacts of greater involvement in cash cropping in swidden agricultural systems. The model uses both individual-based and rule-based modelling approaches. The model formulation is based on a previous report of the social structure, culture and agricultural production system of the Kantu' in West Kalimantan [Dove, M.R., 1985. Swidden Agriculture in Indonesia: The Subsistence Strategies of the Kalimantan Kantu'. Mouton Publishers, Berlin]. The model simulates: (1) births, deaths, marriage, household formation and dissolution; (2) land use decisions on the type, number and location of swidden cultivation; and (3) tracks the consequences of those decisions at a landscape level as well as the economic welfare of the households. The model deals with swidden cultivation of rice and the planting and tapping of rubber. The paper presents a simulation 'experiment' that compares different land use strategies under a scenario of fluctuating rubber price. An important finding is that maintaining swidden cultivation as 'an option' in the farming system, rather than permanently replacing swidden cultivation with cash cropping, appears to be a safer strategy to moderate the impact of commodity price fluctuations

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

AB  - The discovery in 1988 of Acetobacter diazotrophicus, a nitrogen fixing bacterium inhabiting the interior of roots, stems, and leaves of sugarcane, opened a new avenue of research in nitrogen fixation and plant-microbe interactions. The endophytic colonization of sugarcane by A. diazotrophicus represents a model system for analysis of beneficial association between a monocot and a diazotrophic bacterial species. While a few other identified nitrogen-fixing bacteria are apparently endophytic, A. diazotrophicus is so far the most likely to contribute fixed N for growth of its plant host. The evidence for this and also other aspects of the A. diazotrophicus-sugarcane association are presented in this review. Bacterial genes involved in nitrogen fixation and their regulation in A. diazotrophicus are also discussed.

AB  - Spatially explicit urban expansion models that can trace urban development in the past and predict the expansion scenarios in the future are indispensable for examining urban planning policies. This paper demonstrates a new urban expansion scenario (UES) model by coupling one "bottom-up" cellular automata (CA)-based model and one "top-down" system dynamics (SD)-based model. By implementing the UES model in Beijing, the urban evolution from 1991 to 2004 was simulated and the UESs from 2004 to 2020 were predicted. The results suggest that a dilemma of urban expansion versus limited water resource and environment deterioration exists. Dealing with such a dilemma remains a challenge for the local government. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Model Driven Architecture (MDA1 )is anap- proach to application modeling and generation that has received a lot of attention in recent months. Champi- oned by the Object Management Group (OMG), many organizations are now looking at the ideas of MDA as a way to organize andmanage their application solutions, tool vendors are explicitly referring to their capabilities in terms of “MDA compliance”, and the MDA lexicon of platform-specific and platform-independent models is now widely referenced in the industry. In spite of this interest and market support, there is little clear guidance on what MDA means, where we are in its evolution, what is possible with today’s technology, and howto take advantage of it in practice.This paper ad- dresses thatneedbyproviding ananalysis ofhowmodeling is used in industry today, the relevance ofMDAto today’s systems, a classification ofMDA tooling support, and ex- amples of its use.The paper concludeswith a set of recom- mendations for howMDAcan be successful in practice

AB  - The main objective of this study is the coupling of the regional climate\nmodel REMO with a new land surface scheme including dynamic vegetation\nphenology, and the evaluation of the new model version called REMO\nwith interactive MOsaic-based VEgetation: REMO-iMOVE. \n\nFirst, we focus on the documentation of the technical aspects of the\nnew model constituents and the coupling mechanism. The representation\nof vegetation in iMOVE is based on plant functional types (PFTs).\nTheir geographical distribution is prescribed to the model which\ncan be derived from different land surface data sets. Here, the PFT\ndistribution is derived from the GLOBCOVER 2000 data set which is\navailable on 1 km × 1 km horizontal resolution. Plant physiological\nprocesses like photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration are\nincorporated into the model. The vegetation modules are fully coupled\nto atmosphere and soil. In this way, plant physiological activity\nis directly driven by atmospheric and soil conditions at the model\ntime step (two minutes to some seconds). In turn, the vegetation\nprocesses and properties influence the exchange of substances, energy\nand momentum between land and atmosphere. With the new coupled regional\nmodel system, dynamic feedbacks between vegetation, soil and atmosphere\nare represented at regional to local scale. \n\nIn the evaluation part, we compare simulation results of REMO-iMOVE\nand of the reference version REMO2009 to multiple observation data\nsets of temperature, precipitation, latent heat flux, leaf area index\nand net primary production, in order to investigate the sensitivity\nof the regional model to the new land surface scheme and to evaluate\nthe performance of both model versions. Simulations for the regional\nmodel domain Europe on a horizontal resolution of 0.44° had been\ncarried out for the time period 1995–2005, forced with ECMWF ERA-Interim\nreanalyses data as lateral boundary conditions. \n\nREMO-iMOVE is able to simulate the European climate with the same\nquality as the parent model REMO2009. Differences in near-surface\nclimate parameters can be restricted to some regions and are mainly\nrelated to the new representation of vegetation phenology. The seasonal\nand interannual variations in growth and senescence of vegetation\nare captured by the model. The net primary productivity lies in the\nrange of observed values for most European regions. This study reveals\nthe need for implementing vertical soil water dynamics in order to\ndifferentiate the access of plants to water due to different rooting\ndepths. This gets especially important if the model will be used\nin dynamic vegetation studies.

AB  - Because logistics system was an uncertain, nonlinear, dynamic and complicated system, it was difficult to describe it by traditional methods. The wavelet neural network (WNN) has the advantages of both wavelet analysis and neural network, in this paper, a modeling and forecasting method of urban logistics demand based on WNN is presented. Moreover, we adopt a algorithm of reduce the number of the wavelet basic function by analysis the sparseness property of sample data which can optimize the wavelet network in a large extent, and the learning algorithm based on the gradient descent was used to train network. We discussed and analyzed the effect factor of urban logistics demand. With the ability of strong nonlinear function approach and fast convergence rate of WNN, the modeling and forecasting method can truly forecast the logistics demand by learning the index information of affect logistics demand. The actual forecasting results show that this method is feasible and effective.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe the process through which climate change scenarios were downscaled in an urban land use model and the results of this experimentation. The land use models (Urban Growth Model [UGM] and the Land Cover Deltatron Model [LCDM]) utilized in the project are part of the SLEUTH program which uses a probabilistic cellular automata protocol. The land use change scenario experiments were developed for the 31-county New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) of the US Mid-Atlantic Region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 scenarios) were used to define the narrative scenario conditions of future land use change. The specific research objectives of the land use modeling work involving the SLEUTH program were threefold: (1) Define the projected conversion probabilities and the amount of rural-to-urban land use change for the NYMR as derived by the UGM and LCDM for the years 2020 and 2050, as defined by the pattern of growth for the years 1960-1990; (2) Down-scale the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as a narrative that could be translated into alternative growth projections; and, (3) Create two alternative future growth scenarios: A2 scenario which will be associated with more rapid land conversion than found in initial projections, and a B2 scenario which will be associated with a slower level of land conversion. The results of the modeling experiments successfully illustrate the spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for the years 2020 and 2050. The application of these results into the broader scale climate and health impact study is discussed, as is the general role of land use/land cover change models in climate change studies and associated environmental management strategies.

AB  - Cellular automata (CA) are an effective means of urban-growth simulation. Moreover, the development of a planning support system associated with the theory of artificial intelligence has recently become a new global challenge. In this paper we investigate a geosimulation model using CA based on the geographic information system (GIS) for visualising land-use patterns in urban partitions. Most recent simulation models using CA have been developed in regular grid nets or networks, where adjacent grids or networks in urban space are easily addressed. Our project explores how to utilise an irregular polygon dataset in a GIS database in order to deal with spatial microsimulation. A new concept used in this project takes into account the effects of urban planning, such as land-use zoning and street networks, at the level of parcels and blocks in urban space. Adjacent irregular parcels on both sides of a street are intended targets in the simulation. In this paper, a method of simulating land-use patterns in urban space after the implementation of land-readjustment projects is discussed.

AB  - The method of elevation classes, in which the ice surface model is run at multiple elevations within each grid cell, has proven to be a useful way for a low-resolution atmosphere inside a general circulation model (GCM) to produce high-resolution downscaled surface mass balance fields for use in one-way studies coupling atmospheres and ice flow models. Past uses of elevation classes have failed to conserve mass and energy because the transformation used to regrid to the atmosphere was inconsistent with the transformation used to downscale to the ice model. This would cause problems for two-way coupling. A strategy that resolves this conservation issue has been designed and is presented here. The approach identifies three grids between which data must be regridded and five transformations between those grids required by a typical coupled atmosphere–ice flow model. This paper develops a theoretical framework for the problem and shows how each of these transformations may be achieved in a consistent, conservative manner. These transformations are implemented in Glint2, a library used to couple atmosphere models with ice models. Source code and documentation are available for download. Confounding real-world issues are discussed, including the use of projections for ice modeling, how to handle dynamically changing ice geometry, and modifications required for finite element ice models.

AB  - Nowadays China has been soaked in the craze of planning and construct urban logistics park, and almost all developed countries all regard the urban logistics park's construction as a major motivation to the national economic. It is vital that the scientific planning of urban logistics park will ensure China's rapid development. However, too many inappropriate or unscientific planning and construction under the guidance of Government have brought giant economic loss to China. How to plan and design the urban logistics park scientifically, It is a hot topic of research being widely discussed not only by Governments but also enterprisers and scholars home and abroad. This paper begins with exploratory research for modeling and planning on the urban logistics park location selection based on the BP Artificial Neural Network (BP ANN). This paper divides into 3 sections: the first to mainly introduce the history of urban logistics park development and the significance of modelling and planning urban logistics park, the second to analyze basic principle of the BP ANN, the third to simulate and plan the location selection of urban logistics park based on the BP ANN model. The urban logistics park's location selection planning is a complicated and dynamical system engineering with a lot of black box problems, which can't be resloved by System Dynamics, Expert System and traditional mathematical methods (e.g. Operations Research, Statistics), and BP ANN model has seldom been applied to plan urban logistics park in China. So, the research in this paper is an innovation. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - Doha City, the capital of the State of Qatar and its largest city, is located on the Eastern coast of Qatar. The city has been undergoing rapid growth due to increasing oil revenues leading to a sustained economic growth of the country. This has further enhanced a rapid population growth of the city from both internal migration and influx of foreign workers. The population of Doha City reached 45.6% of the total population of Qatar in 2004. During the Nineties, the State of Qatar initiated a number of infrastructural projects that included a large scale dredging and reclamation activities along the coastal areas of Doha. This research aims to use Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques to investigate the rapid urbanization rates and its effect on land use patterns along the costal areas of Doha, as well as to detect the changes that took place in land use types within the city administrative boundaries. Data sources for the study included satellite images (Landsat (1) MSS dated 3/9/1972; Landsat (5) TM dated 28/2/1986; and Landsat (7) ETM+ dated 22/1/2002), field visits and surveys of the coastal areas, and information from technical reports and assessments available from Governmental Departments of Doha City. Using the landsat data, a set of the matic maps were developed to present the net increase in Doha City total area due to dredging and reclamation activities along the city coastline between 1972-2002, as well as a set of maps showing various land use categories of land use types. These included: Vegetation area, Vacant area, Sabkhat, Sandy area, Shallow coastal water, and Urban built area. The output of the application of GIS techniques using 1972, 1986, and 2002 land use maps indicated that the net increase in the coastal areas of the city due to reclamation and dredging activities was 10 Km2 during the period 1972-2002, and the changes that took place during the period 1986-2002 in the land use categories were: Vegetation (green) area decreased by about 1.6 Km2, Vacant area by 37.36 Km2, an indication of the rapid transfer of land in Doha. On the other hand, Sabkhat area decreased by about 5.32 Km2, while the Urban (built) area within the established city administrative boundaries has increased by about 34.5 Km2. The main recommendations of the study are the use of Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques in monitoring land use changes within the city administrative boundaries, as well as the reclamation and dredging activities along the coastal areas, and to use the results for future urban planning; to plan and protect the sensitive costal ecosystems during the reclamation and dredging activities; and conducting enviromental impact assessment studies for new projects and implementation of integrated coastal zone management.

AB  - Understanding the urban growth system is a prerequisite for modelling and forecasting future trends of urban land use/cover change and its ecological impacts. As urban growth involves various actors with different patterns of behaviour, we argue that scientific understanding must be based on elaborated complexity theory and a multidisciplinary framework. The theoretical analysis can provide a guideline for selecting modelling methods currently available in complexity modelling and in remote sensing and GIS environments. This paper first proposes a conceptual model for defining urban growth and its complexity, in which spatial, temporal and decision-making complexity are distinguished as separate domains. Second, this paper links the conceptual model with the major current methods of modern urban modelling, such as cellular automata, fractals, neural networks, multi-agent, spatial statistics etc. This confrontation enables the possibilities of various modelling methods to understand urban growth complexity to be indicated. Third, this paper evaluates the operational implementation of representative methods based on criteria such as interpretability, data need and GIS embeddedness.

AB  - Last few decades witness a dramatic increase in city population worldwide\nassociated with excessive urbanization rates. This raises the necessity\nto understand the dynamics of urban growth process for sustainable\ndistribution of available resources. Cellular automata, an artificial\nintelligence technique composed of pixels, states, neighborhood and\ntransition rules, is being widely implemented to model the urban\ngrowth process due to its ability to fit such complex spatial nature\nusing simple and effective rules. The main objective of our work\nis to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify\ntransition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that\nis designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and\npopulation density. Transition rules in our model identify the required\nneighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration\nis performed spatially to find best rule values per township. Genetic\nalgorithms calibration model, through proper design of their parameters,\nincluding objective function, initial population, selection, crossover\nand mutation, is prepared to fit the cellular automata model. Genetic\nalgorithms start processing the initial solution space, through sequential\nimplementation of the parameters, to identify the best rule values\nusing a predefined criterion over the maximum number of iterations.\nMinimum objective function, representing the total modeling errors,\nis used to identify the optimal rule values. Each rule set is evaluated\nin term of urban level and pattern match with reality. Calibration\nwith genetic algorithms proves to be effective in producing the optimal\nrule values in a time effective manner at an early generation. Proposed\ncalibration algorithm is implemented to model the historical urban\ngrowth of Indianapolis-IN, USA. Urban growth results show a close\nmatch for both urban count and pattern with reality.

AB  - NorESM is a generic name of the Norwegian earth system model. The first version is named NorESM1, and has been applied with medium spatial resolution to provide results for CMIP5 (http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/index.html) without (NorESM1-M) and with (NorESM1-ME) interactive carbon-cycling. Together with the accompanying paper by Bentsen et al. (2012), this paper documents that the core version NorESM1-M is a valuable global climate model for research and for providing complementary results to the evaluation of possible anthropogenic climate change. NorESM1-M is based on the model CCSM4 operated at NCAR, but the ocean model is replaced by a modified version of MICOM and the atmospheric model is extended with online calculations of aerosols, their direct effect and their indirect effect on warm clouds. Model validation is presented in the companion paper (Bentsen et al., 2012). NorESM1-M is estimated to have equilibrium climate sensitivity of ca. 2.9 K and a transient climate response of ca. 1.4 K. This sensitivity is in the lower range amongst the models contributing to CMIP5. Cloud feedbacks dampen the response, and a strong AMOC reduces the heat fraction available for increasing near-surface temperatures, for evaporation and for melting ice. The future projections based on RCP scenarios yield a global surface air temperature increase of almost one standard deviation lower than a 15-model average. Summer sea-ice is projected to decrease considerably by 2100 and disappear completely for RCP8.5. The AMOC is projected to decrease by 12%, 15–17%, and 32% for the RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, respectively. Precipitation is projected to increase in the tropics, decrease in the subtropics and in southern parts of the northern extra-tropics during summer, and otherwise increase in most of the extra-tropics. Changes in the atmospheric water cycle indicate that precipitation events over continents will become more intense and dry spells more frequent. Extra-tropical storminess in the Northern Hemisphere is projected to shift northwards. There are indications of more frequent occurrence of spring and summer blocking in the Euro-Atlantic sector, while the amplitude of ENSO events weakens although they tend to appear more frequently. These indications are uncertain because of biases in the model's representation of present-day conditions. Positive phase PNA and negative phase NAO both appear less frequently under the RCP8.5 scenario, but also this result is considered uncertain. Single-forcing experiments indicate that aerosols and greenhouse gases produce similar geographical patterns of response for near-surface temperature and precipitation. These patterns tend to have opposite signs, although with important exceptions for precipitation at low latitudes. The asymmetric aerosol effects between the two hemispheres lead to a southward displacement of ITCZ. Both forcing agents, thus, tend to reduce Northern Hemispheric subtropical precipitation.

With the growing requirements of quantity and quality in urban content, there is an imperative need for alternative solutions that allow for fast, semiautomatic urban modeling. This course explains new modeling techniques for urban environments as an important complement to traditional modeling software. It explains how to use procedural, image-based, and simulation-based techniques to efficiently create highly detailed three-dimensional urban models for computer games, movies, architecture, and urban planning. The course surveys five major topics: &bull Urban layouts and road modeling &bull Computational building design &bull Image-based modeling of facades and buildings &bull Urban simulation and visualization work &bull Procedural urban modeling in industry. 2011 ACM.

AB  - The paper investigates income disparities and convergence among the EU-25 countries and their NUTS-3 regions during the period 1995-2002. In the empirical analysis of the convergence processes we consider the effects of interactions among neighbouring regions implementing spatial econometrics techniques. We conclude that both the EU-15 and the new member states (NMS) experienced absolute regional income convergence during the EU pre-enlargement period. When national effects were included into convergence equations, there was no evidence for conditional convergence neither between EU-15 nor NMS regions. The results of the analysis indicate that EU regional policy should focus on overall cohesion by improving conditions for regional income convergence particularly within the member states.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most evident global changes. Research in the field of urban growth modelling has generated models that explore for drivers and components of the urban growth dynamics. Cellular automata (CA) modeling is one of the recent advances, and a number of CA-based models of urban growth have produced satisfactory simulations of spatial urban expansion over time. Most application and test of CA-based models of urban growth which provide likely and reliable simulations has been developed in urban regions of developed nations; urban regions in the United States, in particular. This is because most of the models were developed in universities and research centers of developed nations, and these regions have the required data, which is extensive. Most of the population growth in the world, however, occurs in the developing world. While some European countries show signs of stabilization of their population, in less developed countries, such as India, population still grows exponentially. And this growth is normally uncoordinated, which results in serious environmental and social problems in urban areas. Therefore, the use of existing dynamic-spatial models of urban growth in regions of developing nations could be a means to assist planners and decision makers of these regions to understand and simulate the process of urban growth and test the results of different development strategies. The pattern of growth of urban regions of developing nations, however, seems to be different of the pattern of developed countries. The former use to be more dense and centralized, normally expanding outwards from consolidated urban areas; while the second is normally more fragmented and sparse. The present paper aims to investigate to how extent existing CA-based urban growth models tested in developed nations can also be applied to a developing country urban area. The urban growth model was applied to Porto Alegre City, Brazil. An expected contiguous expansion from existing urban areas has been obtained as following the historical trends of growth of the region. Moreover, the model was sensitive and able to portray different pattern of growth in the study area by changing the value of its parameters.

AB  - This poster describes the development and use of a system dynamics wetland model for education and public outreach in Las Vegas, Nevada. The objective of the project is to build public understanding of the value of wetlands in this arid urban environment and enlist critical public support for wetland protection. The model is being used at the Las Vegas Wetlands Park Nature Center, a gateway for the public to a newly created 2,400-acre wetland park. It is designed to address several challenges: low levels of public awareness about the existence and function of this wetland ecosystem and park, lack of understanding about the critical connection between urban development, wetland protection and water quality, and a low level of community participation and involvement in outdoor activities. This interactive model was designed to engage learners through the use of technology and demonstrate the dynamic nature and feedback connections in the ecosystem. The poster presents the model and preliminary results of a study on public receptiveness to this educational approach.

AB  - Following their extensive use in other areas,1 computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have become more widely used in regional policy analysis (see Partridge and Rickman, 1998 for a survey of the regional CGE literature). Although regional CGE models have provided numerous unique policy insights, they have yet to replace other regional models—such as input-output and econometric models—as the standard tool for regional economic development analysis. To be sure, an input-output model is most often the only option for planners in very small regions (West, 1995). Aside from their complexity, the limited use of regional CGE models in practice likely stems from deficiencies in their current formulation, implementation, and description. Therefore, this chapter focuses on what needs to be done for CGE models to become more widely used in regional economic development policy analysis. A key aspect is discussion of features required for CGE models to become more useful in small-area economic policy analysis.

Its aim is to determine the most suitable corridor for new transport infrastructure by employing a spatial decision support system proposed in this project. The system is being tested through its application to a prototype corridor parallel to Interstate 35 between San Antonio and Austin. The basic research questions asked are spatial in nature, so accordingly the geographic information system is the primary method of data analysis. The overall modeling approach is devoted to answering the following questions: What are the considerations to support sustainable growth? What scale or type of infrastructure is necessary? And how to adequately model the transportation corridors to meet the demands and to sustain the living environment at the same time?

AB  - Urban land-use planning and management are in constant mutation throughout the world. With sustainability as the goal, the use of indicators for land auditing and monitoring is becoming more and more in demand. Classical approaches elaborate core sets of indicators by picking the most relevant elements in exhaustive lists. More recently, a few structured research approaches consider the set of indicators as a whole, following the concepts of systernics, and so highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the sets. Starting from the principle that the relevance of an indicator is due not only to its intrinsic qualities, but also to its placement and relationships with the other indicators in the collection, this paper proposes a systemic method, named Relational Indicatorset Model (RIM), for the elaboration of a set of indicators for management support. The RIM method starts with the a priori definitions of the goals and users' purpose (RIM-objectives), and then chooses indicators to reflect the objectives on representing the distribution of indicators in a relational graph (RIM graph). The graph modeling allows analyzing the match between the indicatorset and the defined objectives, as well as the interrelationships between the indicators. The analysis is made easier by breaking down the RIM graph following two projections: the first one (RIM-4D) highlights the distribution of the indicators in a multidimensional graph with respect to the objectives; the second one (RIM-IR) focuses on the interrelationships and offers the possibility of formalizing the causal interactions and the aggregational relationships between the indicators, following a qualitative approach. The RIM is applied to the design of sets of spatial and non-spatial indicators for the cities of Thies (Senegal) and of Geneva (Switzerland) to emphasize the potential of the method. It opens up interesting possibilities for application to all sets of indicators for sustainable land-use development. It also contributes to the creation of observatories for city management, instruments used to monitor and control the urban sustainable development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Owing to development of the cubic construction of modern cities and the protective functions of underground space against the disasters such as earthquake and air raids by modern weapons, the development of urban underground space and the construction of protective sheltering against disasters have become an important policy for many cities. Nevertheless, contradictions between investment and benefit as well as between protection and economy will often occur as a result of the very expensive cost of underground space development. As managers of system, they tend to need to understand these problems and adopt effective measures to find out solutions for them. The method of System Dynamics is no doubt a useful tool for the studies of such problems. This paper has established a system dynamic model about urban underground space development and civil defence construction, including development fund raising, fund distribution, urban underground space construction, subways (i.e., underground railway) construction, urban population and the other auxiliary business dealings performed by the development departments. The model has successfully solved the problem of offering methods for the efficiency of protecting against disasters, the social and economic benefits of urban underground space development and civil defence construction. It reveals the feedback and circulation mechanism and tendency of urban underground space development and civil defence construction.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

AB  - The mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP) bears many similarities to aspects\nof future global warming as projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on\nClimate Change (IPCC, 2007). Both marine and terrestrial data point to\nhigh-latitude temperature amplification, including large decreases in\nsea ice and land ice, as well as expansion of warmer climate biomes into\nhigher latitudes. Here we present our most recent simulations of the\nmid-Pliocene climate using the CMIP5 version of the NASA/GISS Earth\nSystem Model (ModelE2-R). We describe the substantial impact associated\nwith a recent correction made in the implementation of the\nGent-McWilliams ocean mixing scheme (GM), which has a large effect on\nthe simulation of ocean surface temperatures, particularly in the North\nAtlantic Ocean. The effect of this correction on the Pliocene climate\nresults would not have been easily determined from examining its impact\non the preindustrial runs alone, a useful demonstration of how the\nconsequences of code improvements as seen in modern climate control runs\ndo not necessarily portend the impacts in extreme climates.\nBoth the GM-corrected and GM-uncorrected simulations were contributed to\nthe Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) Experiment 2. Many\nfindings presented here corroborate results from other PlioMIP\nmulti-model ensemble papers, but we also emphasise features in the\nModelE2-R simulations that are unlike the ensemble means. The corrected\nversion yields results that more closely resemble the ocean core data as\nwell as the PRISM3D reconstructions of the mid-Pliocene, especially the\ndramatic warming in the North Atlantic and Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian\nSea, which in the new simulation appears to be far more realistic than\npreviously found with older versions of the GISS model. Our belief is\nthat continued development of key physical routines in the atmospheric\nmodel, along with higher resolution and recent corrections to mixing\nparameterisations in the ocean model, have led to an Earth System Model\nthat will produce more accurate projections of future climate.

AB  - This paper presents an urban land-use simulation model using cellular automata (CA). In the model urban growth is regarded as the result of a global process underpinned by local actions and land-use change as the joint action of three different effects: attribute, heterogeneity, and gravity. The attribute and heterogeneity effects are regarded as different aspects of a local driving force for change constituted by changing accessibility and other attributes resulting from the interaction of land use and transport at the neighborhood level. The gravity effect is a universal resistance to change as a result of inertia and agglomeration of compatible land uses in the vicinity. To ensure that local actions would lead to global behavior, a multipass, in addition to a single-pass, land-use-allocation algorithm is designed to mimic land-use changes. With metropolitan Melbourne in Australia as a case study, the performance of the model in replicating land-use changes is compared with that of an alternative model developed by using only a distance function. The results of the comparison show that the proposed CA model outperforms the alternative model with only a distance function, confirming the importance of incorporating local attributes in modeling land-use changes.

Decision support in this domain needs some spatial information enabling to forecast the urban development trends. Satellite imagery may provide reliable information assessing the different states of urban growth, but it is necessary to anticipate where future built areas might be located. This paper presents the interest of interaction models, more precisely the potential model, to define future development zones. This model is applied to the Strasbourg area (France) using remotely sensed data. Two images are used, one to initiate the model processing and the other to validate the results. GIS capabilities are applied to refine the results, adding traffic network in the study. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are manyadvantages of applying cellular automata (CA) models to urban systems: realism, spatiality, resolution, presentation, and links with geographic information systems. The CA lattice can be generalized to represent urban spatial structures, networks of accessibility, or the physical infrastructure of the city. Not surprisingly, CA and the patterns that they generate exhibit many idiosyncrasies of complex adaptive systems, such as phase shifts, power laws, self-organization, self-similarity, and fractal dimensions. Spatial relationships, such as topologies and networks, are crutial parts of a GIS database. Topology is employed to manage common boundaries between features, define and enforce data integrity rules, and support topological queries and navigation (for example, to determine feature adjacency and connectivity). Topology is also used to support sophisticated editing and to construct features from unconstructed geometry (for example, to construct polygons from lines). Networks describe a connected graph of GIS objects that can be traversed. This is important for modeling pathways and navigation for transportation, utilities, and many other network-based applications. Practically, CA and GIS have several generalities indeed. First link between CA models and GIS can be observed on an initial stage of the modeling: CA pattem and raster data are cell-based (pixels). Second one is spatial relationships that depends on local connections. Third and the most promising link is that integrating them we can get more information about urban system development. As an example, we take a small raster drawing from GIS, use it in our Urban CA Model (URBACAM) as a pattern, reach relevant proportions; make some simulations and analysis.

In addition, the MMS Library of components can now be modified and
extended with a new tool named MMS CompGen<sup>TM</sup>. The MMS Model
Builder allows the user to quickly build a graphical schematic
representation for a plant by selecting from a library of predefined
power plant components to dynamically simulate their operation. In
addition, each component has a calculation subroutine stored in a
dynamic-link library (DLL), which facilitates the determination of a
steady-state condition and performance of routine calculations for the
component. These calculations, termed auto-parameterization, help avoid
repetitive and often tedious hand calculations for model initialization.
Component connection is provided within the Model Builder based on
connectivity rules defined for each component. The simulation code
generator makes use of the graphically defined connections to
automatically and analytically define fluid-flow paths, mechanical
couples, or signal/logic flow paths within the simulation model. In
striving to meet the needs for large models and increase user
productivity, the MMS Model Builder has been completely revamped to make

AB  - Lake areas in Chinese urban fringes are under increasing pressure of urbanization. Consequently, the conflict between rapid urban sprawl and the maintenance of water bodies in such areas urgently needs to be addressed. An integrated GIS-based analysis system (IGAS) for supporting land-use management of lake areas in urban fringes was developed in this paper. The IGAS consists of modules of land-use suitability assessment and change/demand analysis, and land evaluation and allocation. Multicriteria analysis and system dynamics techniques are used to assess land-use suitability and forecast potential land-use variation, respectively. Cost approximation and hypothetical development methods are used to evaluate land resource and market values, respectively. A case study implementing the system was performed on the Hanyang Lake area in the urban fringe of Wuhan City, central China, which is under significant urbanization pressure. Five categories of suitability were investigated by analyzing 11 criteria and related GIS data. Two scenarios for potential land-use changes from 2006 to 2020 were predicted, based on a systematic analysis and system dynamics modeling, and a hierarchical land-use structure was designed for the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. The IGAS may help local authorities better understand and address the complex land-use system, and develop improved land-use management strategies that better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents an analysis on accessibility of healthcare facilities in Enugu urban area in a GIS environment. This was achieved through acquisition of a base map of Enugu State showing geographic extent of Enugu Urban, determining the geometric positions of health institutions in Enugu urban using handheld GPS, Creation of a spatial database of existing healthcare facilities and demonstrating through various analyses the potentials of GIS in measurement of accessibility to healthcare facilities in Enugu urban Area. The analysis includes network analysis, used to determine the closeness of a facility and shortest route to these healthcare facilities. ARCGIS 9.3 was the main software used. This was supported by Geocal for coordinate conversion and Microsoft office packages. The result of the study showed the spatial distribution of health institutions, closest facilities in case of emergency and route to those health institutions within Enugu urban Area. It was noticed that most of the healthcare facilities were located within Enugu North local government area (LGA). Other settlements and LGAs had fewer healthcare facilities. Areas deprived of healthcare facility were also identified. Routes and closest facilities to those deprived areas were identified in the settlements/area. The analysis showed the efficacy of GIS in determining accessibility of healthcare institutions in Enugu urban area. The study is thus, recommended as a spatial decision support system for decisions regarding spatial accessibility of healthcare facilities in an urban area.

AB  - Modelling urban land use change can foster understanding of underlying processes and is increasingly realized using agent-based models (ABM) as they allow for explicitly coding land management decisions. However, urban land use change is the result of interactions of a variety of individuals as well as organisations. Thus, simulation models on urban land use need to include a diversity of agent types which in turn leads to complex interactions and coding processes. This paper presents the new ABMland tool which can help in this process: It is software for developing agent-based models for urban land use change within a spatially explicit and joint environment. ABMland allows for implementing agent-based models and parallel model development while simplifying the coding process. Six major agent types are already included as coupled models: residents, planners, infrastructure providers, businesses, developers and lobbyists. Their interactions are pre-defined and ensure valid communication during the simulation. The software is implemented in Java building upon Repast Simphony and other libraries.

AB  - The mechanism of urban growth and its interaction with social-economic and environmental systems are still poorly understood. Consequently, policy makers and planners often face tremendous difficulties in decision making with lack of vision into the future of urban growth. The Land-use Evolution and impact Assessment Model (LEAM) has been developed to as a comprehensive urban planning support system in a regional scale. LEAM incorporates ecological, geographic, and environmental theories into a single hierarchical framework, yet it is designed as an open architecture. LEAM is unique in that all sub systems are explicitly and separately modeled. Sub models are developed by experts, who have substantive knowledge relating to a particular system, using icon-based graphical modeling tool, STELLAÆ. These contextual sub-models are then linked to form the main framework of the dynamic model that run simultaneously on each grid cell of raster GIS map(s) in Spatial Modeling Environment (SME). The overall model then is created in an open and distributed manner. A land-use decision support system for St. Louis metropolitan region using LEAM approach has been developed.

AB  - A sustainability technology evaluation platform has been prototyped for simulating integrated technology systems within a specific urban regional context. “Sustainability technologies” refer to available and potentially available technologies that may help to decrease human pressures on the environment or natural resources while providing a desired standard of living. The platform is based on an Internet-based infrastructure for integrating distributed models, called DOME (distributed object-based modeling environment) that has been developed to provide a simulation environment in which large systems, such as an urban region, can be modeled. The infrastructure can support flexible and transparent integration of independently developed computational tools from a wide range of fields such as geographic information systems, input–output analysis, life cycle analysis, and technology process modeling. The tools are linked in a decentralized ad-hoc manner so that an integrated simulation can be developed as understanding of the system grows. Tools are available to observe and understand the emerging structure of the system simulation, and to evaluate and optimize the system based upon its behavior.The urban sustainability technology evaluation platform is built from three basic types of computational elements linked through DOME. These are elements that provide information defining the urban region, elements that simulate behavior of technologies to be evaluated, and elements that integrate and analyze the region-specific effects of the technologies. As an example of the first type, a GIS (geographic information system)-based land use object has been developed to provide information needed to drive simulation models for a wide variety of urban technologies. Examples of the second type include technology simulation models of photovoltaic solar cell modules (PV modules). An object that provides a generalized life-cycle assessment by calculating both the direct and indirect effects of a given technology on total production levels and total pollution emissions in a region using Leontief Input–Output analysis represents the third type of computational element. All of the objects support Internet-enabled GUI''s (graphic user interfaces) through the DOME infrastructure, allowing users to transparently connect to, interact with, and utilize object functionality or data.A system model is constructed from these elements to study the economic cost and effect on emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> associated with installing PV modules on the rooftops of buildings in Tokyo, Japan. The development of this technology evaluation simulation illustrates the use of the three types of objects and how, by using the DOME infrastructure, they may be linked to form system models to evaluate sustainability technologies.

AB  - As many local and state governments in the United States grapple with increasing growth pressures, the need to understand the economic and institutional factors underlying these pressures has taken on added urgency. From an economic perspective, individual land use decisions play a central role in the manifestation of growth pressures, as changes in land use pattern are the cumulative result of numerous individual decisions regarding the use of lands. In this study, the issue of growth management is addressed by developing a spatially disaggregated, microeconomic model of land conversion decisions suitable for describing residential land use change at the rural-urban fringe. The model employs parcel-level data on land use in Calvert County, Maryland, a rapidly growing rural-urban fringe county. A probabilistic model of residential land use change is estimated using a duration model, and the parameter estimates are employed to simulate possible future growth scenarios under alternative growth management scenarios. Results suggest that “smart growth” objectives are best met when policies aimed at concentrating growth in target areas are implemented in tandem with policies designed to preserve rural or open space lands.

AB  - Geographic information processing and visualization on new types of platform such as mobile environment or web environment has been regarded as one of industrial and academic issues. For this, the various approaches for mobile GIS and Web GIS are being carried out on the application level. Motivation of this study is on system architecture and a prototype implementation for 3D mobile and Web 3D application. Platforms and devices for mobile 3D GIS technology manipulating geographic data and information provide some limitation to design and implement: limited CPU and memory, absence or limited performance of graphic accelerators, small size of display panel, and so on. Moreover, in the urban application, 3D spatial information is crucial for complex feature modeling. Core functions of mobile 3D GIS by feature-based approach was designed as some modules: data model and design of spatial features, editing and manipulating of 3D landscape objects, generating of geometrically complex type features, supporting of both database and file system, handling of attributes for 3D objects, texture mapping of complex types of 3D objects and digital elevation model with image library containing high resolution satellite imagery. With these functions, an integrated urban 3D modeling and rendering system was implemented using standard mobile 3D graphic API (application programming interface), OPENGL|ES (Open GL for embedded system), with MS EVC 4.0 MFC. As well as this mobile 3D design and implementation, multiple types of geographic features or objects encoded by GML (geography markup language) for the XML-databases building are taken into account of practical applicability for 3D urban approaches. For this process, it was carried out to implement GML editor software with the main functions: supporting and customizing map style sheet, attribute editing, adding/deleting/manipulating geo-base features in fundamental urban data model as the framework model level and user-defined model f-

AB  - Computer graphics and its broader application as visualization are at last beginning to have an impact on the ways analysts and model builders articulate and communicate their intellectual understanding of urban systems. Geographic information systems (GIS) lie in the vanguard of these developments and there is presently much effort in linking these systems to traditional spatial models so that the power of GIS databases and display capabilities can be harnessed. To demonstrate the import of these ideas, a prototypical visual environment has been developed for such modeling and in this paper it is shown how it can be implemented. The elements of such visualization are first defined in terms of the model-based processes which characterize applications, emphasizing data exploration, model calibration, prediction, and prescription. These processes are then concentrated through model inputs, outputs, and causal structures, illustrating the operation of various model sectors through different modes of spatial statistical and graphic analysis. These ideas are implemented through windowing systems which mix text, numerics, and graphics, and are illustrated using an elementary model of residential location of Melbourne, Australia. The operation of the model in a UNIX environment which is accessed through proprietary windows-based software is demonstrated, thus providing a platform to discuss the problems of linking conventional model-based techniques to graphics software in general, GIS in particular. The paper is concluded with a sketch for future work.

AB  - This paper proposes an uneven pilot-assisted channel estimation (CE) technique for OFDM sysetms in mobile environments. We find that the prerequisites of most previous studies are using an equal spaced pilots pattern and sample-spaced channels. This is not the case in practical systems. According to conventional pilot-assisted estimators, we develop an improved channel estimation method based on the criteria of Lesat Square (LS) for IEEE802.16e OFDM systems. In this practical system, pilots are not evenly inserted in the frequency band and the non-sample-spaced multipath delay leads to channel impulse response (CIR) leakage in the time domain. The proposed uneven pilot-assisted CE method is conducted in the frequency domain and it uses a linear model to approximate the time-varying characteristic of CIR in the frequency domain during each OFDM symbol. Analysis and simulations demonstrate its low computational complexity, good performance and practicability in actual OFDM systems.

AB  - Urbanization has profoundly transformed many landscapes throughout the world, and the ecological consequences of this transformation are yet to be fully understood. To understand the ecology of urban systems, it is necessary to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of urbanization, which often requires dynamic modeling and spatial analysis. In this paper, we describe an urban growth model, the Phoenix Urban Growth Model (PHX- UGM), illustrate a series of model calibration and evaluation methods, and present scenario-based simulation analyses of the future development patterns of the Phoenix metropolitan region. PHX-UGM is a spatially explicit urban landscape model and is a modified version of the Human-Induced Land Transformations (HILT) model originally developed for the San Francisco Bay Area. Using land use and other data collected for the Phoenix area, existing growth rules were selectively modified and new rules were added to help examine key ecological and social factors. We used multiple methods and a multi-scale approach for model calibration and evaluation. The results of the different evaluation methods showed that the model performed reasonably well at a certain range of spatial resolutions (120–480 m). When fine-scale data are available and when landscape structural details are desirable, the 120-m grain size should be used. However, at finer levels the noise and uncertainty in input data and the exponentially increased computational requirements would considerably reduce the usefulness and accuracy of the model. At the other extreme, model projections with too coarse a spatial resolution would be of little use at the local and regional scales. A series of scenario analyses suggest that the Metropolitan Phoenix area will soon be densely populated demographically and highly fragmented ecologically unless dramatic actions are to be taken soon to significantly slow down the population growth. Also, there will be an urban morphological threshold over which drastic changes in certain aspects of landscape pattern occur. Specifically, the scenarios indicate that, as large patches of open lands (including protected lands, parks and available desert lands) begin to break up, patch diversity declines due partly to the loss of agricultural lands, and the overall landscape shape complexity also decreases because of the predominance of urban lands. It seems that reaching such a threshold can be delayed, but not avoided, if the population in the Phoenix metropolitan region continues to grow. PHX-UGM can be used as a tool for exploring the outcome of different urban planning strategies, and the methods illustrated in this paper can be used for evaluating other urban models.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe the process through which climate change scenarios were downscaled in an urban land use model and the results of this experimentation. The land use models (Urban Growth Model [UGM] and the Land Cover Deltatron Model [LCDM]) utilized in the project are part of the SLEUTH program which uses a probabilistic cellular automata protocol. The land use change scenario experiments were developed for the 31-county New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) of the US Mid-Atlantic Region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 scenarios) were used to define the narrative scenario conditions of future land use change. The specific research objectives of the land use modeling work involving the SLEUTH program were threefold: (1) Define the projected conversion probabilities and the amount of rural-to-urban land use change for the NYMR as derived by the UGM and LCDM for the years 2020 and 2050, as defined by the pattern of growth for the years 1960-1990; (2) Down-scale the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as a narrative that could be translated into alternative growth projections; and, (3) Create two alternative future growth scenarios: A2 scenario which will be associated with more rapid land conversion than found in initial projections, and a B2 scenario which will be associated with a slower level of land conversion. The results of the modeling experiments successfully illustrate the spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for the years 2020 and 2050. The application of these results into the broader scale climate and health impact study is discussed, as is the general role of land use/land cover change models in climate change studies and associated environmental management strategies.

In order to resolve the problems on the current 3D modeling method of urban underground pipeline network, we present a novel algorithm based on a 3D component library in this paper. The algorithm, introduces the concept of 3D component library, makes the 3D models of standard pipe fittings as element components and splits the complex 3D model of the underground pipeline network into several element components. The element components are classified by type and stored in the 3D component library. When construct the underground pipe network 3D models, firstly, gets the element components by the type ID of 2D entities, then through the approach that the combination of different element components, we can obtain the accurate 3D models. Comparing with the traditional 3D modeling method of urban underground pipeline network, this new algorithm is more lifelike and accurate. The system based on the method can improve the efficiency of its development and the reusability of its resource. This new algorithm also provides a common solution for a complex 3D model, which can construct the 3D model of complex urban facilities, such as overpass.

AB  - Using ecological network analysis, we analyzed the network structure and ecological relationships in an urban water metabolic system. We developed an ecological network model for the system, and used Beijing as an example of analysis based on the model. We used network throughflow analysis to determine the flows among components, and measured both indirect and direct flows. Using a network utility matrix, we determined the relationships and degrees of mutual ism among six compartments -1) local environment, 2) rainwater collection, 3) industry. 4) agriculture. 5) domestic sector, and 6) wastewater recycling - which represent producer, consumer, and reducer trophic levels. The capacity of producers to provide water for Beijing decreased from 2003 to 2007, and consumer demand for water decreased due to decreasing industrial and agricultural demand: the recycling capacity of reducers also improved, decreasing the discharge pressure on the environment. The ecological relationships associated with the local environment or the wastewater recycling sector changed little from 2003 to 2007. From 2003 to 2005, the main changes in the ecological relationships among components of Beijing's water metabolic system mostly occurred between the local environment, the industrial and agricultural sectors, and the domestic sector, but by 2006 and 2007, the major change was between the local environment, the agricultural sector, and the industrial sector. The other ecological relationships did not change during the study period. Although Beijing's mutualism indices remained generally stable, the ecological relationships among compartments changed greatly. Our analysis revealed ways to further optimize this system and the relationships among compartments, thereby optimizing future urban water resources development. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The problem of traffic congestion is attracting lots of attention with the aim of investigating efficient solutions. To achieve models that comprehensively describe the system, useful data from the network is needed. A suggestion is to mount detectors in selected regions and study the system responses to various stimuli. This, however, might be costly and impractical in many cases. Traffic simulators are beneficial tools for providing a simulated environment of the network. The current study tries to develop a traffic simulator within NetLogo, an agent-based environment. Using this simulator, the effect of different light plans on average delay time (ADT) of vehicles is investigated. The results indicate that in a normal-sized network a better choice is the simultaneous change of lights. A long length is appropriate for low entering frequencies and an average length is more efficient for high entering frequencies. In geometrically bigger networks, lights are better to change every other one with an average length for low entering frequencies and a long length for high entering frequencies.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

During the past decades, urban residential development has speed up extremely with massive population mobility in cities. The purpose of this study is to propose an integrated approach for sustainability assessment of urban residential development, considering sustainability indicators, housing equilibrium and building visualization. Firstly based on merging DPSIR (Driving Forces, Pressure, State, Impact and Response) framework and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the indicators were systematized for the sustainability modeling. Due to the urban activities cause impacts not only on local level but also a broader scale, a simulation model, using System Dynamics (SD) methodology, was structured to quantitatively investigate the developmental tendency of the indicators. And then the estimated results were displayed in 2D density maps in ArcGIS and 3D visualization in CityEngine. A real case study was presented for the Stuttgart Region of the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in Southern Germany and its Plieningen district to experience the usefulness and feasibility of the developed approach. The integration of GIS, SD model and 3D visualization, called GISSD system here, can better explain the interaction and the variation of the sustainability indicators for residential development. Hence it is able to support the Decision Maker to view the sustainable level of urban residential areas more comprehensively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Declining water quality in the Chesapeake Bay estuary is in part the result of disruptions in the hydrological system caused by urban and suburban development throughout its 167000 km(2) watershed. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for a wide range of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km(2) area centered on the Washington - Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) ecologically sustainable growth. The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application.

AB  - A clear and accurate understanding of communication network performance is essential, especially where all layers of the protocol stack - from physical propagation to application transport protocols - must be accounted for. While some solutions exist for RF communications over `open-terrain' areas, the urban environment is particularly challenging. To meet this challenge, a server-based, real-time solution for assessing complex communication and network effects in urban environments has been developed. By combining advanced RF ray-tracing propagation modeling and a full network simulator, the Scalable Urban Network Simulation (SUNS) software is able to provide accurate communications effects services. SUNS supports tactical modeling and simulation by predicting electro-magnetic signal coverage and path loss through application of a full 3D physical knowledge of the urban environment and terrain features. The commercial OPNET network simulator is used as the core of the system, with SUNS operations supported through a custom OPNET model that functions as a modeling and simulation server. The server, in turn, communicates with other node models within the OPNET simulation. In the approach, urban propagation data are pre-computed using high-performance computing (HPC) resources utilizing ray traced models of the urban scene.

This system is designed from the understanding that land use and development drive the demand for infrastructure and infrastructure can have a significant influence on the ways in which land is developed and used. A water distribution network analysis model and a network capacity expansion model can address the dynamic interdependence between water planning and land use planning. While the water distribution network analysis model evaluates the performance of generated networks, the capacity expansion model chooses alternatives to meet expanding water needs.

AB  - The role of robust communications plays an ever pervasive and critical role in today's network-oriented asymmetric warfare. This is especially true in urban environments, where insurgencies tend to be most active and detrimental to the civilian population. Urban-level communications needs to be addressed through a new generation of modeling and simulation tools that not only model the physical layers of radio communications, but that also account for reactive network behaviors that drive higher-level force actions (e.g., the interplay of ground troops, ground vehicles, airborne UAVs, manned aircraft, etc.) Such tools should become essential to communications mission planning, while advancing the deployment of optimally designed communications systems for use in highly complex RF environments. To this end, we describe the Scalable Urban Network Simulation (SUNS), which coordinates physical layer EM propagation modeling with network-level and higher "forces level" modeling to achieve a highly interactive, "full communications stack" approach to network simulation.

AB  - Qualitative calculus of policy models is an appropriate method for policy impact analysis in the case of imprecise information concerning the structural model parameters. The conditions of the so-called sign-solvability analysis of a linear equation system--with information represented by a positive, negative, or zero impact--are strict, however. In this paper, the relevance of qualitative calculus for urban policy modelling is discussed. An extension of the sign-solvability approach (with purely qualitative information) will be dealt with in the case of a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. We introduce the use of matrix decomposition methods, of theoretically plausible parameter restrictions, and of a top-down/bottom-up approach for sign-solvability. The sign-solvability approach is applied to a dynamic policy simulation model of urban decline in The Netherlands, developed for the city of The Hague. Given the insufficiently reliable database for estimating the model in a conventional econometric way, qualitative calculus was used in order to infer conclusions regarding the direction of impacts of policy variables.

AB  - During the last decades the crisis of bureaucratic organizations became evident, we can see the movement towards more flexible network structures. Modern economy is dominated by the process of globalization that is followed by the increase of informational flows and economic relations. In these circumstances the need for organizations to pool resources for the strengthening of competitive position in the market becomes essential. Evidently the importance of network organizations as a means for attraction of investment and its effective use can only grow. In the face of these changes various subjects of business create a certain "community" around them that is shaped by selected criteria. This process could be explained by the need of the organization to protect its interest and to increase the effectiveness of the use of its resources. In such a way sustainable groups of business subjects are formed, they become interlinked by a variety of networks. The key elements that unite the participants of the network are historically formed commitments and mutual interest, the opportunity to participate in the activities of the company and use its resources, markets and technology, accessibility of administrative resource and so on. A network of organizations is a system of value creation, in which several organizations that have complementary strengths form an alliance that is beneficial to all of the participants; this alliance allows organizations to be successful in the environment of rapid change (Castells, 2003; Issakson, 2010; Staniulienė, 2006; Zakarevičius, 2002). One of the most important activities in a network is the creation of coordination system that would regulate the relations and activities between the member organizations (Κyщ, 2006; Danese, 2005; Kumar, 2001; Seifert, 2003; Rudberg, 2008). The problem of this article is the difficulty of coordination of the activities of members or the network of organizations. The object of the article is the coordination system in the network of organizations. The goal of the article is to provide the model for coordination in the network of organizations. The tasks of the research are: 1. To analyse the approaches to the network structures; 2. To determine the structure of the system of coordination in the network of organizations; 3. To provide a model of coordination system in the network of organizations. The article is written using the methods of analysis and synthesis of scientific literature. The literature regarding network organizations and organizational networks (Castells, 2003; Issakson ir kt., 2010; Staniulienė, 2006; Zakarevičius, 2002), the processes of coordination (Κyщ, 2006; Danese, 2005; Kumar, 2001; Seifert, 2003; Rudberg, 2008) was analysed, and synthesis method was used to create the model of coordination system in network of organizations. We came to conclusion that there are two dominant views on network structures, one holds that a network inside of organization, and that connects several organizations should be considered a network organization; another view separates network organization from the network of organizations. We think that the network of organizations is comprised by de jure independent organizations that are collaborating in the achievement of a common goal. The coordination system in these networks of organizations is different and more straightforward than in a network organization. The system of coordination in network of organizations is comprised by totality of actions (adjustment of processes, structures and goals), means (ERP, APS) and canals of communication that allows adjusting all of the relations between elements of the network. The use of advanced coordination systems in the network of organizations could lead to the improvement of quality of production or services, reduction of inventory in all of the levels of value chain, could reduce the cost of activity and ensure more effective use of limited resources. We provided a model that illustrates the coordination system in the network of organizations, this system is formed by the coordination centre and coordination nods that are linked by the communication links an is based on the model of Collaborative Planning, Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR), that is meant for the adjustment of inter-organizational activities. We also note that even advanced technological means such as ERP that are oriented to the coordination of processes inside of organization, could not always be successfully adapted for the coordination of networks of organizations.

AB  - The core version of the Norwegian Climate Center's Earth System Model, named NorESM1-M, is presented. The NorESM-family of models are based on the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, but differs from the latter by, in particular, an isopycnic coordinate ocean model and advanced chemistry-aerosol-cloud-radiation interaction schemes. NorESM1-M has a horizontal resolution of approximately 2° for the atmosphere and land components and 1° for the ocean and ice components. NorESM is also available in a lower resolution version (NorESM1-L) and a version that includes prognostic biogeochemical cycling (NorESM1-ME). The latter two model configurations are not part of this paper. Here, a first-order assessment of the model stability, the mean model state and the internal variability based on the model experiments made available to CMIP5 are presented. Further analysis of the model performance is provided in an accompanying paper (Iversen et al., 2012), presenting the corresponding climate response and scenario projections made with NorESM1-M.

AB  - The paper explores a framework combining remote sensing and spatial metrics aimed at improving the analysis and modeling of urban growth and land use change. While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales.

AB  - 'The Glasgow Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS) Management Project' satisfies the first of three phases of the 'Glasgow Surface Water Management Project'. This is Glasgow City Council's contribution to the Transformation of Rural and Urban Spatial Structure (TRUST) project, one of the European Union's (EU) inter-regional (INTERREG IIIB) North Sea funded research projects. This project shows also how SUDS can contribute to the overall catchment dynamics of cities such as Glasgow, ultimately relieving stress on the current predominantly combined sewer system, and increasing the urban habitat value at the same time. Fifty-seven sites within 46 areas of Glasgow were identified for assessment. A detailed soil chemistry analysis and a desk study relating to vegetation, historical and current (regeneration and development) planning issues were undertaken. Detailed design guidelines were then drafted for seven selected representative demonstration areas (including the Gadburn area) of high public and property developers interest, and education value. A SUDS option decision support model was developed to help the planners to suggest appropriate SUDS techniques for potential construction sites based on site characteristics (SUDS variables). A combination of swales with ponds or wetlands were the most likely SUDS options for the majority of the demonstration areas.

Simulations have been made using a statistical model of urban growth in a system of cities (the Gibrat’s model).Results however show systematic discrepancies with observations. Coming back to empirical features of urban dynamics on a very long term and for a very large set of towns and cities (Europe, 1600-2000) brings new hypothesis which will be introduced in further formulations of the model.

AB  - Urban transportation system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops and influenced by transportation, social, economical, and environmental factors. Conventional transportation modeling approaches are unsuitable to simulate and evaluate its performance. This paper presents a system dynamics approach based on the cause-and-effect analysis and feedback loop structures. The proposed SD model comprises 7 submodels: population, economic development, number of vehicles, environmental influence, travel demand, transport supply, and traffic congestion. The model runs in Vensim PLE software using the data from Dalian, China. The coefficient of the intervention policy of vehicle ownership is chosen as the control variable for simulation, and the impacts of different policy scenarios on urban development and transportation system are analyzed. It suggests that Dalian should restrict the total number of vehicles to improve the sustainability of transportation system.

AB  - The effective modeling of the urban landscape dynamics in a megalopolitan cluster area (MCA) is essential to understanding its spatial evolution process. However, existing urban landscape dynamic models based on cellular automata (CA) are limited in that they do not consider urban flows (e.g., flows of people, material, and information) between the different cities/towns in an MCA. This paper proposes a new megalopolitan landscape dynamic model (MLDM) that is better suited for simulating the urban landscapes in an MCA by combining a gravitational field model (GFM) with a CA model. The GFM was used to model the influence of inter-city urban flows and to refine the transition rules of the CA model. The MLDM was applied to simulate the urban landscape in the MCA of Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, and produced more accurate simulation results than the CA model that did not account for urban flows. The MLDM-based prediction of future landscapes suggested that urbanization will continue in the region through 2020, especially in a few 'hotspot' areas. Close attention should be paid to these areas for strategic regional planning and environmental protection in this heartland of China. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The demand for 3D city-scale models has been significantly increased due to the proliferation of urban planning, city navigation, and virtual reality applications. We present an approach to automatically reconstruct buildings densely spanning a large urban area. Our method takes as input calibrated aerial images and available GIS meta-data. Our computational pipeline computes a per-building 2.5D volumetric reconstruction by exploiting photo-consistency where it is highly sampled amongst the aerial images. Our building surface graph cut method overcomes errors of occlusion, geometry, and calibration in order to stitch together aerial images and yield a visually coherent texture-mapped result. Our comparisons show similar quality to the manually modeled buildings of Google Earth, and show improvements over naive texture mapping and over space-carving methods. We have tested our algorithms with a 12 sq km area of Boston, MA (USA), using 4667 images (i.e., 280 GB of raw image data) and producing 1785 buildings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Simultaneously, the main factors, such as travel time, pricing and convenience which influence travelers' choice behaviors are all considered and a combined assignment model is proposed to simulate travelers' mode and route choices. A bi-level programming model, in which the multi-objective optimization model is treated as the upper-level problem and the combined assignment model is processed as the lower-level problem, is then presented to solve multi-criterion system optimization problem for urban multimodal traffic network. The solution algorithms of the proposed models are also presented. Finally, the model and its algorithms are illustrated through a simple numerical example.

AB  - This paper presents an improved cellular automata (CA) model of urban growth based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach with inertia weight. An innovative feature of this cellular model is the incorporation of swarm intelligence to stochastically optimize the transition rules to reduce the simulation uncertainties and improve its locational accuracy in urban modeling. The similarity between the nature of self-organization of particle swarm optimizers and the bottom-up approach of cellular automata makes PSO particularly suitable to search for the global optimum parameters of CA transition rules. The CA parameters retrieved by the PSO technique are able to express precisely the contributions of various driving forces to urban growth; hence an effective cellular model can be realized for modeling urban dynamics. The PSO based CA model was applied in Fengxian District of Shanghai Municipality, eastern China, to simulate the spatio-temporal process of urban growth from 1992 to 2008 at 30. m spatial resolution. The simulation outcomes, evaluated with error matrix and simulation accuracies, demonstrate that the PSO-CA model outperforms other spatial statistical based CA models. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A conceptual model for structuring features in a geographic information system (GIS) is presented. The model includes spatial, thematic, and temporal dimensions and structures attributes and relationships for each dimension to build a feature-based GIs. The model is grounded in an entity-based view of geographic phenomena and requires representation of geographic entities as feature objects in GIS. The model is built on concepts from region theory in geography, category theory in cognitive psychology, and dafa modeling theories, including abstraction and generalization concepts in cartog- raphy and GI~. The feature construct provides direct access to spatial, thematic, and temporal attributes and relation- ships and thus supports multiple representations and multi- ple geometries, such as raster and vector. The rich structure has potential application for spatial analysis and sophisti- cated geographic process models. Resolution and application dependencies of feature-based systems are discussed with tools to aid in feature determination. Example features are included with parts of the model explicated for these exam- ples.

AB  - Photochemical modeling studies are undertaken for an area to find out the best means of controlling high ozone levels there. As a part of the photochemical modeling process, the entire area of study needs to be divided into small grids of equal sizes and total emissions of ozone precursors (NOx and VOC) from that area needs to be specified at the center of these grids. Previous studies by Brandmeyer et. al. (2000) and Kim et. al. (2000) have used GIS techniques for emissions allocation into different grids encompassing the study area. Currently a modeling study is being undertaken for the Corpus Christi urban airshed. This paper basically reports on the method, which was used for allocating emissions of ozone precursors from area and non-road sources into grid cells of the two counties of Nueces and San Patricio comprising the urban airshed of Corpus Christi using the geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Two GIS software namely, Arcview and Arcinfo were used in this study for allocation of these emissions and their subsequent visualization (ESRI, 1997a & 1997b).

AB  - Here we describe the first version of the Minnesota Earth System Model for Ocean biogeochemistry (MESMO 1.0), an intermediate complexity model based on the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system model (GENIE-1). As with GENIE-1, MESMO has a 3D dynamical ocean, energy-moisture balance atmosphere, dynamic and thermodynamic sea ice, and marine biogeochemistry. Main development goals of MESMO were to: (1) bring oceanic uptake of anthropogenic transient tracers within data constraints; (2) increase vertical resolution in the upper ocean to better represent near-surface biogeochemical processes; (3) calibrate the deep ocean ventilation with observed abundance of radiocarbon. We achieved all these goals through a combination of objective model optimization and subjective targeted tuning. An important new feature in MESMO that dramatically improved the uptake of CFC-11 and anthropogenic carbon is the depth dependent vertical diffusivity in the ocean, which is spatially uniform in GENIE-1. In MESMO, biological production occurs in the top two layers above the compensation depth of 100 m and is modified by additional parameters, for example, diagnosed mixed layer depth. In contrast, production in GENIE-1 occurs in a single layer with thickness of 175 m. These improvements make MESMO a well-calibrated model of intermediate complexity suitable for investigations of the global marine carbon cycle requiring long integration time.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this review was to assess the safety and efficacy of thoracic and lumbar paravertebral blocks (PVBs) for surgical anesthesia through a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature. PVBs for surgical anesthesia were compared with general anesthesia (GA) or other regional anesthetic techniques. METHODS: We searched literature databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library up to May 2008. Included studies were limited to eligible randomized controlled trials. Eight randomized controlled trials were included in this review, 6 of which used PVBs for anesthesia during breast surgery, and 2 trials used PVB for anesthesia during herniorrhaphy. RESULTS: The ability to obtain firm conclusions was limited by the diversity of outcomes and how they were measured, which varied across studies. The PVB failure rate was not >13%, and patients were more satisfied with PVB than with GA. There was some indication that PVB could achieve shorter hospital stays than GA. PVB for anesthesia substantially reduces nausea and vomiting in comparison with GA (relative risk: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.13-0.50; P < 0.05), although it does carry a risk of pleural puncture and epidural spread of local anesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, based on the current evidence, PVBs for surgical anesthesia at the level of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are associated with less pain during the immediate postoperative period, as well as less postoperative nausea and vomiting, and greater patient satisfaction compared with GA.

AB  - This paper explores the development of BPD as it might emerge in the child's early interpersonal reactions and how such reactions might evolve into the interpersonal pattern that typifies BPD. It begins to bridge the relevant bodies of clinical literature on the borderline's prototypic interpersonal problems with the concurrently expanding relevant literature on early child development. We will start by considering how a psychobiological disposition to BPD is likely to include a constitutional diathesis for relational reactivity, that is, for hypersensitivity to interpersonal stressors. Data relevant to this disposition's manifestations in adult clinical samples and to its heritability and neurobiology will be reviewed. We then consider how such a psychobiological disposition for interpersonal reactivity might contribute to the development of a disorganized-ambivalent form of attachment, noting especially the likely contributions of both the predisposed child and of parents who are themselves predisposed to maladaptive responses, leading to an escalation of problematic transactions. Evidence concerning both the genetics and the developmental pathways associated with disorganized attachments will be considered. Emerging links between such developmental pathways and adult BPD will be described, in particular the potential appearance by early- to middle-childhood of controlling-caregiving or controlling-punitive interpersonal strategies. Some implications from this gene-environment interactional theory for a better developmental understanding of BPD's etiology are discussed.

AB  - The growth of urban areas into forested and agricultural lands is a local and global planning issue of great concern. The proposed model is hence based on the raster data model. The raster-based GM is implemented using object-oriented Microsoft Visual C++ programming under the Microsoft Windows environment. To satisfy more analysis methods expended for this system, such as CA and neural network models, a virtual base class (CPredictModel) is defined for their united interfaces. The vector data are integrated into the raster-based GM method by the vector-to-raster conversions. To validate the raster-based data model, time series of raster data are generated from Landsat TM for the Jilin City, China, in 1987, 1996, and 2000. The changes between any two dates can be analyzed efficiently, and the growth trends of Jilin City in the future are evaluated successfully by the presented raster-based data model.

AB  - Concerns the simulation and validation of brushless DC drive models. The combination of an AC machine, rotor position feedback and drive amplifier is normally classed as a brushless drive. With the improvement in power electronic device technology, brushless DC drives are increasingly displacing conventional DC machines in high performance servo applications. A brushless machine is similar to a permanently excited synchronous machine in that the rotor carries permanent magnets which give rise to a very low inertia system whilst the stator typically has a three phase star-connected winding. The stator winding may be either distributed or concentrated leading to two generic machine types: those driven by trapezoidal and those by sinusoidal waveforms. The drive amplifier uses the position feedback information to synthesise the appropriate armature currents. Brushless drives were investigated because very high performance drives were required to meet the specification of a particular engineering problem. Demanding positional control of the drives was required (to within 0.0025 radians at 2500 r/min carrying high inertial loads). In order to achieve the best performance from the drives obtained, simulation was used to predict behaviour and performance, to aid design and attain greater understanding of the systems

AB  - In this paper I build on current research in urban and ecological simulation modeling to develop a conceptual framework for modeling the urban ecosystem. Although important progress has been made in various areas of urban modeling, operational urban models are still primitive in terms of their ability to represent ecological processes. On the other hand, environmental models designed to assess the ecological impact of an urban region are limited in their ability to represent human systems. I present here a strategy to integrate these two lines of research into an urban ecological model (UEM). This model addresses the human dimension of the Puget Sound regional integrated simulation model (PRISM)—a multidisciplinary initiative at the University of Washington aimed at developing a dynamic and integrated understanding of the environmental and human systems in the Puget Sound. UEM simulates the environmental pressures associated with human activities under alternative demographic, economic, policy, and environmental scenarios. The specific objectives of UEM are to: quantify the major sources of human-induced environmental stresses (such as land-cover changes and nutrient discharges); determine the spatial and temporal variability of human stressors in relation to changes in the biophysical structure; relate the biophysical impacts of these stressors to the variability and spatial heterogeneity in land uses, human activities, and management practices; and predict the changes in stressors in relation to changes in human factors.

AB  - One of the most powerful tools to improve the planning process of urbanization and to predict its consequent effects on surface waters and floods is hydrologic modeling. Several models have been developed and applied for modeling urban waters following different approaches. This paper shows the initial efforts of developing a modeling system composed by coupling a 1D flow routing model to a 2D-raster based model to simulate urban inundation, with an additional module to simulate the rainfall-runoff process in contributing areas. As a preliminary test of the modeling system under development, the urban catchment of Moinho da Areia (Porto Alegre, Brazil) was simulated by running the 1D and 2D hydraulic models, off-line coupled on a single direction. Results are evaluated in terms of inundation extent simulated for design hydrographs of several return periods. The general inundation patterns were considered coherent to what is known about the region, thus illustrating the potential of the system under development for modeling urban flooding.

AB  - Abstract The process of urban land use change is influenced by the interactions of various stakeholders who have conflicting values and priorities. These interactions, which are characterized by a strong competition for advantageous land locations, can be represented by an agent-based model in order to better understand, analyze and forecast possible future urban land use patterns. The objective of this study is to develop and implement Agent iCity, an agent-based model that simulates the process of urban land-use change by using irregular spatial units at a cadastral scale and by incorporating the interactions of the key stakeholders. The simulation outcomes are generated for two scenarios of the process of urban land use change as it occurs under the conditions of different urban growth policies. The model is implemented on municipal cadastral and land use data for part of the City of Chilliwack, Canada, a city that has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. The results indicate that that relative household incomes and property values drive the changes in urban land use patterns as households search for affordable homes in suitable neighbourhoods. The developed Agent iCity model can assist urban planners in better understanding and analysis of the changes in urban land use patterns.

AB  - We discuss and evaluate the representation of atmospheric chemistry in the global Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 4, the atmospheric component of the Community Earth System Model (CESM). We present a variety of configurations for the representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, wet removal, and online and offline meteorology. Results from simulations illustrating these configurations are compared with surface, aircraft and satellite observations. Major biases include a negative bias in the high-latitude CO distribution, a positive bias in upper-tropospheric/lower-stratospheric ozone, and a positive bias in summertime surface ozone (over the United States and Europe). The tropospheric net chemical ozone production varies significantly between configurations, partly related to variations in stratosphere-troposphere exchange. Aerosol optical depth tends to be underestimated over most regions, while comparison with aerosol surface measurements over the United States indicate reasonable results for sulfate , especially in the online simulation. Other aerosol species exhibit significant biases. Overall, the model-data comparison indicates that the offline simulation driven by GEOS5 meteorological analyses provides the best simulation, possibly due in part to the increased vertical resolution (52 levels instead of 26 for online dynamics). The CAM-chem code as described in this paper, along with all the necessary datasets needed to perform the simulations described here, are available for download at < a href='http://www.cesm.ucar.edu'> www.cesm.ucar.edu </a >.

AB  - Spatially explicit and dynamic urban growth models provide valuable simulations that encapsulate essential knowledge in planning and policy making such as how and where urban growth can occur and what the driving forces of such changes are. Agent Based Modeling (ABM) yields a useful framework understanding complex urban systems and provides an arena for exploring the possible outcome states of various policy actions. Yet most research efforts of this sort adopt physical and heuristic approaches which tend to neglect socio-economic dynamics which is critical in shaping urban form and its transformation. This research project has two main goals. First, it develops an agent based urban simulation model which has a more rigid theoretical explanation of agent behavior than most such models hitherto. To achieve this, the research integrates microeconomic theory into an agent based modeling framework. Utility maximizing residential location choices made by households are modeled as the main impetus for urban growth through agglomeration and sprawl. Then random utility theory is used to capture the stochastic nature of agent behavior. Second based on such urban dynamics, alternative planning policy options such as greenbelts and public transportation are modeled so that their impacts can be clarified. In this way, the model examines how planning policy alters the economic utility of households and redirects market-led urban development.

AB  - The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model, a reduced-resolution coupled general circulation model, has previously been described in this journal. The model is configured for millennium scale or multiple century scale simulations. This paper reports the impact of replacing the relatively simple land surface scheme that is the default parameterisation in Mk3L with a sophisticated land surface model that simulates the terrestrial energy, water and carbon balance in a physically and biologically consistent way. An evaluation of the new model's near-surface climatology highlights strengths and weaknesses, but overall the atmospheric variables, including the near-surface air temperature and precipitation, are simulated well. The impact of the more sophisticated land surface model on existing variables is relatively small, but generally positive. More significantly, the new land surface scheme allows an examination of surface carbon-related quantities including net primary productivity which adds significantly to the capacity of Mk3L. Overall, results demonstrate that this reduced-resolution climate model is a good foundation for exploring long time scale phenomena. The addition of the more sophisticated land surface model enables an exploration of important Earth System questions including land cover change and abrupt changes in terrestrial carbon storage.

AB  - SLEUTH is a modified cellular automata (CA) model which consists of an urban growth sub model and a land cover change transition sub model. The urban growth model is the main component of SLEUTH, which is tightly coupled with the land cover change transition model. This model was chosen to calibrate urban growth in two Asian cities, Chiang Mai (Thailand) and Taipei (Taiwan). These cities are undergoing rapid land use/land cover change as a result of robust economic and population growth. SLEUTH cellular automata model contains characteristics that offer advantages for modelling physical dynamics. Because of its cellular data structure, it can be integrated with raster-based remote sensing data. Calibration of the SLEUTH model requires gridded inputs of topographic slope, land use, zones excluded from growth, urban spatial extents, transportation networks and terrain hillshading. These data were developed from remote sensing and from topographic maps using GIS, and were prepared at three different resolutions. This research applied the SLEUTH cellular automata model to explore land use dynamics of the two Asian cities over several decades. Three phases of calibration were used, corresponding to progressively higher spatial resolutions whilst the ranges of SLEUTH parameters were narrowed. The result yielded five key parameters characterizing historical urban growth patterns and suggesting a basis for exploring future scenarios of land-use change. We discuss the lessons learned from applying SLEUTH model to Chiang Mai and Taipei compared to other SLEUTH applications. The study reveals that: (1) urban development in Chiang Mai is best captured by Xmean and edge growth regression scores, whereas Taipei is best simulated by fitting using the Lee Sallee shape correspondence index; (2) the SLEUTH model can be applied to study urban land use dynamics in both countries, when some adaptations for spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are made. With a suitably calibrated model, the next phase of research is to use it to explore alternative futures by adjusting some of the key parameters. It is also intended to use the urban extents from other years in the calibration to observe the model sensitivity to temporal data sets. At this stage the model moves from a descriptive tool to one that could help facilitate deliberation about alternative futures about the urban growth patterns for Chiang Mai and Taipei. The historical understanding provided  by the model would need to be communicated in graphics, but with care many of the cellular automata ideas are intuitive and visually exciting for researchers to explore (Lebel, et. al., 2005). In conclusion, applying the SLEUTH model to Taiwan and Thailand can increase the potential use of remote sensing and GIS data for the land cover change modeling. The result will be very useful to city planners, resource managers, policy makers and others in the related fields.

AB  - CITIES grow in a way that might be expected to resemble the growth of two-dimensional aggregates of particles, and this has led to recent attempts(1-3) to model urban growth using ideas from the statistical physics of clusters, In particular, the model of diffusion-limited aggregation(4,5) (DLA) has been invoked to rationalize the apparently fractal nature of urban morphologies(1). The DLA model predicts that there should exist only one large fractal cluster, which is almost perfectly screened from incoming 'development units' (representing, for example, people, capital or resources), so that almost all of the cluster growth takes place at the tips of the cluster's branches. Here we show that an alternative model, in which development units are correlated rather than being added to the cluster at random, is better able to reproduce the observed morphology of cities and the area distribution of sub-clusters ('towns') in an urban system, and can also describe urban growth dynamics, Our physical model, which corresponds to the correlated percolation model(6-8) in the presence of a density gradient(9), is motivated by the fact that in urban areas development attracts further development. The model offers the possibility of predicting the global properties (such as scaling behaviour) of urban morphologies.

AB  - A county-seat model explains the distribution of urban places among counties by dividing the places in a region into those places which are county seats and all other places. This type of model is studied under the simplifying assumption that the location of places among counties is random, but the distinction between county-seat places and other places leads to the restriction that no county contains more than one county-seat place. This model is tested for urban places in the state of Iowa in terms of distribution (frequency distribution of places within counties) and arrangement (relative concentration or dispersion of places among adjacent counties). An intensive empirical examination of the model is conducted, and generally good agreement is found between values given by the model and values obtained from the Iowa urban system.

AB  - Closely interacting organisms are supposed to follow a common history where one of the associates tracks the other in an evolutionary time-scale. In the rhizobia-legume symbiosis, phylogenies from ribosomal sequences do not show parallel divergence with plant taxonomy. The molecular machinery of the symbiosis has been shown to be shaped among others by gene duplication, lateral transfer and recombination. These genetic events render most genes and gene products unsuitable for studying the co-diverging pattern of the symbiosis. Some of the genes involved in the nodulation process could have been acquired by different genera of rhizobia by lateral transfer. Their evolution, however, could have been then under the plant functional constraint, with the Nod factors as a target for this selection pressure. The nodA phylogeny reveals a common ancestor for all the rhizobia producing Nod factors acylated by polyunsaturated fatty acids. In a similar way, the legume phylogeny also displays a common origin for the host plants of these rhizobia. Based on these data, two strategies can be defined for the recognition of Nod factors by the plant, and a model has been built to try to clarify the evolutionary relationships between them.

AB  - We describe an interactive system that models regions of an urban environment, such as a group of tall buildings. Traditional image-based modeling methods often cannot model such large areas due to error accumulation and limited camera field of view. Our approach widens the camera field of view by constructing a 360 degree panorama from ground-level images and uses a high resolution orthorectified aerial image to provide the building footprints. Users draw the building outlines in the aerial image and select a point as the approximate ground camera location. The method automatically extracts roof corners in the ground images and registers the panorama to the aerial image according to geometric constraints. The height of each building is calculated from an estimated camera pose. The resulting textured model of the buildings is constructed of planar surfaces.

AB  - Modeling urban growth and generating scenarios are essential for studying the impact and sustainability of an urban hydrologic system. Urban systems are regarded as complex self-organizing systems, where the dynamic transitions from one form of landuse to another occur over a period of time. Therefore, a modeling framework that captures and simulates this complex behavior is essential for generating urban growth scenarios. Cellular Automata (CA)-based models have the potential to model such discrete dynamic systems. In this study, a constraint-based binary CA model was used to predict the future urban growth scenario of the city of Roorkee (India). A hydrologic model was applied on the simulated urban catchment to study its hydrologic response. The Natural Resources Conservation Service Curve Number (NRCS-CN) method, which is suitable for ungauged urban watersheds, was adopted to determine the impact of urban growth on the quantity of storm water runoff over a period of time. The results indicate that urban growth has a linear relationship with peak discharge and time to peak for the catchment under investigation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In urban systems modeling, there are many elaborate dynamic models based on intricate decision processes whose simulation must be based on customized software if their space-time properties are to be explored effectively. In this paper we present a class of urban models whose dynamics are based on theories of development associated with cellular automata (CA), whose data is fine-grained, and whose simulation requires software which can handle an enormous array of spatial and temporal model outputs. We first introduce the generic problem of modeling within GIS, noting relevant CA models before outlining a generalized model based on Xie's (1996, A general model for cellular urban dynamics. Geographical Analysis, 28, 350-373) "dynamic urban evolutionary modeling" (DUEM) approach. We present ways in which land uses are structured through their life cycles, and ways in which existing urban activities spawn locations for new activities. We define various decision rules that embed distance and direction, density thresholds, and transition or mutation probabilities into the model's dynamics, and we then outline the software designed to generate effective urban simulations consistent with GIS data inputs, outputs and related functionality. Finally, we present a range of hypothetical urban simulations that illustrate the diversity of model types that can be handled within the framework as a prelude to more realistic applications which will be reported in later papers.

AB  - A dynamic model of the urban land and building market is proposed which explicitly incorporates endogenous spatial externalities. Using stochastic optimization the model estimates for each period first the supply of building space and then the spatial allocation of activities. Prices for buildings and land are endogenous. The development of the urban area depends on the demand for labor in basic industries. The dynamics of the system is controlled also by the lagged response to endogenous variables. Thus, both the level of externalities, which affect the allocation of activities, and rents, which influence the location of the building supply, are based on the results of the preceding period.

AB  - This paper formulates a new generation of Lowry-style models that combine a multizonal input-output model and an urban land use allocation model. Three different types of models are proposed: 1) an unconstrained model, 2) a primal of a linear programming approach that includes land supply constraints, and 3) a modified dual of the linear programming approach that allocates land based on additional conditions of economic efficiency. The modified dual formulation improves upon the limitations of Lowry models and their derivatives. First, the proposed model has sound theoretical underpinnings that incorporate the production theory of inputoutput models and the behavioral theory of optimization models. Second, the proposed model allocates land on the basis of economic efficiency by imposing a procedure that equalizes shadow prices. And third, the proposed model is an optimization model that fully accounts for the spatial and sectoral relationships of multiplier effects determining land use demand.

AB  - The detailed representation of the topography is an important aspect when dealing with any flood simulation model. A Digital Surface Model (DSM) with fine spatial resolution can capture topographic object boundaries with a high level of detail. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is a technology that can rapidly collect elevation data of a relatively large topographic area with fine spatial resolution (<0.5m similar to 1m). Information about physical objects on the DSM is critical for storm water management as the propagation of flood water is influenced by both the terrain and the objects on the terrain. The processing of LiDAR data is an important task for generating an accurate DSM suitable to running a flood simulation model. Filtering is the first step in processing LiDAR data. In the LiDAR community, the term "filtering" means the task of separating LiDAR data into ground (bare earth) and non-ground points (buildings and trees). However, the choice of appropriate filtering algorithm is crucial in order to detect micro objects such as boundary walls, fences, and thin embankments that have significant impact on the surface flow pattern. This study offers an innovative approach for developing a LiDAR filtering algorithm that is flexible in nature and able to detect not only buildings and trees but also the micro objects. The filtering algorithm is applied to two study areas, and the output suggests close correspondence to reality.

AB  - Urban growth analysis and simulation have been recently conducted by cellular automata (CA) models based on self-organizing theory which differs from system dynamics models. This paper describes the Beijing urban development model (BUDEM) which adopts the CA approach to support urban planning and policy evaluation. BUDEM, as a spatio-temporal dynamic model for simulating urban growth in the Bei- jing metropolitan area, is based on the urban growth theory and integrates logistic regression and MonoLoop to obtain the weights for the transition rule with multi-criteria evaluation configuration. Local sen- sitivity analysis for all the parameters of BUDEM is also carried out to assess the model’s performances. The model is used to identify urban growth mechanisms in the various historical phases since 1986, to re- trieve urban growth policies needed to implement the desired (planned) urban form in 2020, and to simulate urban growth scenarios until 2049 based on the urban form and parameter set in 2020. The model has been proved to be capable of analyzing historical urban growth mechanisms and predicting future urban growth for metropolitan areas in China.

Covers, generally, the various attributes of power system stability, recognizing two basic approaches. The first is categorized under large disturbance nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.

Using a geographic information systems--based data set of Christmas tree and horticultural farms, value effects of the urban growth boundary were found to vary by farm size, land use, and proximity to urban activities. The results suggested that proximity to negative externalities associated with urban activities had strong impacts on farming within the UGB. These impacts overweighed advantages associated with tax savings and increasing certainty within EFU districts.

AB  - The preservation of riparian zones and other environmentally sensitive areas has long been recognized as one of the most cost-effective methods of managing stormwater and providing a broad range of ecosystem services. In this research, a cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain model of land cover change was developed to integrate protection of environmentally sensitive areas into urban growth projections at a regional scale. The baseline scenario is a continuation of the current trends and involves only limited constraints on development. The green infrastructure (GI) conservation scenario incorporates an open space conservation network based on the functional boundaries of environmentally sensitive areas. It includes variable buffer widths for impaired streams (as identified on the USEPA 303d list for stream impairment), 100-year floodplain, wetlands, urban open space and steep slopes. Comparative analysis of each scenario with landscape metrics indicated that under the GI conservation scenario, the number of urban patches decreased while the extent of interspersion of urban land with green infrastructure patches increased leading to improved connectivity among open space features. The analysis provides a quantitative illustration of how our process contributes towards achieving urban planning objectives while incorporating green infrastructure. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate statistical framework that is used to model complex relationships between directly and indirectly observed (latent) variables. SEM is a general framework that involves simultaneously solving systems of linear equations and encompasses other techniques such as regression, factor analysis, path analysis, and latent growth curve modeling. Recently, SEM has gained popularity in the analysis of complex genetic traits because it can be used to better analyze the relationships between correlated variables (traits), to model genes as latent variables as a function of multiple observed genetic variants, and assess the association between multiple genetic variants and multiple correlated phenotypes of interest. Though the general SEM framework only allows for the analysis of independent observations, recent work has extended SEM for the analysis of general pedigrees. Here, we review the theory of SEM for both unrelated and family data, the available software for SEM, and provide an example of SEM analysis.

AB  - In this paper we ask two questions: Does a multiscalar urban land-change model that couples a region-scale system dynamics model with a local-scale spatial logit model better predict the amount of urban land change than either model alone? Does a multiscalar urban land-change model that couples regional and local-scale factors better predict the spatial patterns of urban land change than a standalone local-scale spatial logit model? To examine these questions, we develop a coupled system dynamics spatial logit (CSDSL) model for the Pearl River Delta, China, that incorporates region-scale population and economic factors with local-scale biophysical and accessibility factors. In terms of predicting the amounts of urban land change, the CSDSL model is 15% and 18% more accurate than the standalone spatial logit and system dynamics models, respectively. In terms of predicting the spatial pattern of urban land change, the CSDSL model slightly outperforms the spatial logit model as measured by four spatial pattern metrics: number of urban patches, urban edge density, average urban patch size, and spatial irregularity of the urban area. Both the CSDSL and spatial logit models underpredict the number of discrete urban patches (by 64% and 80%, respectively) and the urban edge density (by 42% and 62%, respectively). While both models overpredict the average urban patch size, the spatial logit model overpredicts by over 316%, while the CSDSL overpredicts by 192%. Finally, the models perform equally well in predicting the spatial irregularity of urban areas and the location of urban change. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the CSDSL model outperforms a standalone spatial logit or system dynamics model in predicting the amount and spatial complexity of urban land change. The results also show that predicting urban land-change patterns remains more difficult than predicting total amounts of change.

AB  - A 3D reconstruction of an urban area for Virtual Worlds (VWs) or Serious Games (SGs) requires a careful trade-off among the 3D models' realism, weight and development time. This has led us to the definition of an algorithm – the Architectonic Style Area (ASA) algorithm – for procedural generation of buildings in an urban area, based on the concept of “architectonic likelihood”, that intends to give players the sense of being in a particular city or even specific area of a city. This has a cognitive foundation in the fact that, after a visit, a tourist typically does not remember every single palace of a city, but remembers – beside the most important monuments and buildings – its general features and its architectonic styles. The algorithm extrudes 2D maps and composes façades by statistically assembling sample images of architectonic components from the target city. Components are classified in an ontology based on the classic principles of architecture. The algorithm relies on rules that encode the semantics of the ontology. The paper describes the algorithm and the related easy-to-use visual authoring tool. It also shows the results in two different projects: a SG for the promotion of the cultural heritage and a 3D movie. Results show that the approach allows keeping the realism of every single building at good detail and of the overall scene, while dropping a huge work of image collection and processing for the textures. Comparisons are investigated with regard to state of the art urban modeling methods, highlighting the differences and possible synergies.

AB  - This paper describes a type of project that images a city as it might exist given the integration of hemostatic procedures within pedestrian networks during emergencies requiring full-scale egress from an urban core. It articulates the steps taken to integrate a pre-existing C++ hemostasis model (C. Jacob, 2008) into Maya software in order to describe how the project operates on a computational level. By projecting these agent-based logics directly into/onto each pedestrian in the city (the smallest unit of the system), egress-oriented infrastructure can shift from being extensively predetermined in form (concrete barriers, metal railing, police barricades, etc.), to something more intensively defined, real-time, and locally on-demand. These procedures are situated within a larger schema based on the structural principles of Norbert Wiener's cybernetic feedback loops, that acknowledge and allow for hybrid (top-down + bottom-up) awareness and control within systems. The project attempts to ally itself with emerging forms of network design with similar structural typologies supported through the use of personal mobile devices (PMDs) in urban environments.

Adoption of Rational Function Models (RFM's) during recent years as a replacement for satellite's rigorous sensor model by many commercial imagery providers makes 3D information extraction fast and reliable for most of end-users. This paper presents an application of RFM in generating 3D terrain models, i.e. bear-ground models void of any vegetation and man-made objects, as well as 3D surface modeling (surface models with man-made objects). A fast one- dimensional terrain-dependent object-based search technique for identifying correspondences in multiple images followed by a refined 2D search to obtain an optimal correspondence match is introduced. Corresponding objects are then used in conjunction with the RFM to generate 3D model of the area. Example of correspondence matching and a 3D model generated for a selected area of Yokohama, Japan using QuickBird stereo images is presented.

The two main premises are: 1. There is much to be gained by approaching a theoretical modeling task from a broader perspective than is usual in this field. Rather than attempt to fine-tune a single-purpose algorithm, we sought to integrate many different procedures and processes into a comprehensive model of an entire organism. 2. From a purely psychobiological point of view, a model that integrates many different weak and idiosyncratic processes into a powerful and capable system is a more realistic expression of the way the real organic perceptual motor system works.

AB  - In recent years, urbanization has been one of the most striking change processes in the socioecological system of Central Europe. Cellular automata (CA) are a popular and robust approach for the spatially explicit simulation of land-use and land-cover changes. The CA SLEUTH simulates urban growth using four simple but effective growth rules. Although the performance of SLEUTH is very high, the modeling process still is strongly influenced by stochastic decisions resulting in a variable pattern. Besides, it gives no information about the human and ecological forces driving the local suitability of urban growth. Hence, the objective of this research is to combine the simulation skills of CA with the machine learning approach called support vector machines (SVM). SVM has the basic idea to project input vectors on a higher-dimensional feature space, in which an optimal hyperplane can be constructed for separating the data into two or more classes. By using a forward feature selection, important features can be identified and separated from unimportant ones. The anchor point of coupling both methods is the exclusion layer of SLEUTH. It will be replaced by a SVM-based probability map of urban growth. As a kind of litmus test, we compare the approach with the combination of CA and binomial logistic regression (BLR), a frequently used technique in urban growth studies. The integrated models are applied to an area in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia involving a highly urbanized region along the Rhine valley (Cologne, Düsseldorf) and a rural, hilly region (Bergisches Land) with a dispersed settlement pattern. Various geophysical and socio-economic driving forces are included, and comparatively evaluated. The validation shows that the quantity and the allocation performance of SLEUTH are augmented clearly when coupling SLEUTH with a BLR- or SVM-based probability map. The combination enables the dynamical simulation of different growth types on the one hand as well as the analyses of various geophysical and socio-economic driving forces on the other hand. The SVM approach needs less variables than the BLR model and SVM-based probabilities exhibit a higher certainty compared to those derived by BLR.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Linear programming models of spatial economy (Mills, 1972, 1974a, 1974b, 1975) have prompted the development of several diverse extensions. The purpose of this paper is to review and assess the impact of Mills' model on the development of its derivatives, and to evaluate the role of these models in the development of LUTE (Land Use Transport Environment) formulations These models are assessed and reviewed by dividing them into four categories: (1) static urban linear programming models: (2) static nonlinear programming models; (3) static regional scale models; and (4) dynamic models. including intertemporal and sequential programming models. An extended Mills model is proposed that combines intertemporal production and transportation with pollution control-a prototype LUTE application.

AB  - Smart cards are portable tamper-resistant cryptographic devices that play a key role in digital security. This paper reviews the latest use of smart cards in securing network, online services, operating systems, and card-holder identity. Smart card network authentication is routinely used on GSM and 3G networks, and this paper shows how the same infrastructure can be extended to perform WiFi access point authentication. Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication. Finally, the paper will show how smart cards and trusted platform module have complementary roles for recuring the operating systems, and the use of smart cards in identity frameworks such as liberty alliance or Microsoft cardspace.

AB  - A carbon flow model was constructed of the northern Benguela upwelling ecosystem. The model consists of 22 living and two non-living compartments, depicting the biomass of each compartment and the rates of exchange between them. The only primary producer in this system is phytoplankton, whilst bacteria, heterotrophic microflagellates and microzooplankton form part of the microbial loop. Primary consumers include mesozooplankton, macrozooplankton and jellyfish, while the fish community consists of anchovy, pilchard, lanternfish, gobies, horse mackerel, bake, snoek, benthic feeding fish and other carnivorous fish. The top consumers are seabirds and seals. The primary production-zooplankton-pelagic fish-demersal fish energy flow pathway appears to dominate in this system, with jellyfish, pilchard and horse mackerel being the most important planktivores. Jellyfish appears to be an important component in the system due to its high biomass and consumption of about 10% of the primary production. Hake is the most important secondary consumer. The carbon flow model was analyzed by means of network analysis, and the results show a total system throughput of about 88897 mg C m(-2) day(-1), a development capacity of 38 041 mg C m(-2) day(-1), an ascendancy value of 17 313 mg C m(-2) day(-1), that about 7% of the total system throughput is recycled on a daily basis, and that the internal relative ascendancy is about 44%. These results were compared to similar data from other systems such as the southern Benguela and the Peruvian upwelling systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an urban modeling system using CAD/GIS data for atmosphere environmental simulation, such as wind flow and contaminant spread in urban area. The CAD data is used for the shape modeling for the high-storied buildings and civil structures with complicated shape since the data for that is not included in the 3D-GIS data accurately. The unstructured mesh based on the tetrahedron element is employed in order to express the urban structures with complicated shape accurately. It is difficult to understand the quality of shape model and mesh by the conventional visualization technique. In this paper, the stereoscopic visualization using virtual reality (VR) technology is employed for the verification of the quality of shape model and mesh. The present system is applied to the atmosphere environmental simulation in urban area and is shown to be an useful planning and design tool to investigate the atmosphere environmental problem. ?? 2008 Tsinghua University Press.

AB  - The main characteristics of the new version 1.2 of the three-dimensional Earth system model of intermediate complexity LOVECLIM are briefly described. LOVECLIM 1.2 includes representations of the atmosphere, the ocean and sea ice, the land surface (including vegetation), the ice sheets, the icebergs and the carbon cycle. The atmospheric component is ECBilt2, a T21, 3-level quasi-geostrophic model. The ocean component is CLIO3, which consists of an ocean general circulation model coupled to a comprehensive thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice model. Its horizontal resolution is of 3° by 3°, and there are 20 levels in the ocean. ECBilt-CLIO is coupled to VECODE, a vegetation model that simulates the dynamics of two main terrestrial plant functional types, trees and grasses, as well as desert. VECODE also simulates the evolution of the carbon cycle over land while the ocean carbon cycle is represented by LOCH, a comprehensive model that takes into account both the solubility and biological pumps. The ice sheet component AGISM is made up of a three-dimensional thermomechanical model of the ice sheet flow, a visco-elastic bedrock model and a model of the mass balance at the ice-atmosphere and ice-ocean interfaces. For both the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, calculations are made on a 10 km by 10 km resolution grid with 31 sigma levels. LOVECLIM1.2 reproduces well the major characteristics of the observed climate both for present-day conditions and for key past periods such as the last millennium, the mid-Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum. However, despite some improvements compared to earlier versions, some biases are still present in the model. The most serious ones are mainly located at low latitudes with an overestimation of the temperature there, a too symmetric distribution of precipitation between the two hemispheres, and an overestimation of precipitation and vegetation cover in the subtropics. In addition, the atmospheric circulation is too weak. The model also tends to underestimate the surface temperature changes (mainly at low latitudes) and to overestimate the ocean heat uptake observed over the last decades

AB  - Abstract We present polymorphic scenarios, a gener- alization of a UML2-compliant variant of Damm and Harel’s live sequence charts (LSC) in the context of object- orientation. Polymorphic scenarios are visualized using (modal) sequence diagrams where lifelines may represent classes and interfaces rather than concrete objects. Their semantics takes advantage of inheritance and interface reali- zation to allow the speciﬁcation ofmost expressive, succinct, and reusable universal and existential inter-object scenar- ios for object-oriented system models. We motivate the use of polymorphic scenarios, formally deﬁne their trace-based semantics, and present their application for scenario-based testing and execution, as implemented in the S2A compiler developed at the Weizmann Institute of Science. We further discuss advanced semantic issues arising from the use of scenarios in a polymorphic setting, suggest possible exten- sions, present a UML proﬁle to support polymorphic scenar- ios, consider the application of the polymorphic semantics to other variants of scenario-based speciﬁcation languages, and position our work in the broader context of behavioral subtyping.

AB  - Cities have long been recognized as complex and dynamic entities. However, the mathematical description of cities has been traditionally based on aggregate observations and on their static properties. Although some new approaches derived from the science of complex systems, particularly Cellular Automata (CA), have been explored in recent years, many urban researchers think that current forms of these models are cursory, fragmentary, and unrealistic in terms of theoretical and practical solidity. This paper generalizes an urban model to deal with questions of dynamic urban evolutionary modeling (DUEM). The DUEM situates its conceptual and technical foundations on Couclelis's CA spaces, Dendrinos' urban selection, and contemporary techniques of GIS. The DUEM provides a generic modeling technique that is capable of capturing the processes of evolutionary reproduction at the the finest level and handling interactions between automaton self-reproduction and environmental and socioeconomic influences through the feedback among neighborhood, field, and region. Here we first review developments of dynamic systems theories and CA in particular. We then discuss emerging issues of CA applications in urban fields, and lay out conceptual foundations for this research. Next, we propose a generic urban CA model-DUEM for describing urban complexities and dynamics. We finally show how this generic model can be used to simulate growth dynamics for multi-sector land uses in a suburban area of Buffalo, New York.

AB  - Spatially land use models are indispensable for sustainable land use planning. This study demonstrates a combined Markov–Cellular Automata model to analyze temporal change and spatial distribution of land use stressed by natural and socioeconomic factors in Saga, Japan. Firstly, area change and spatial distribution of land use are calculated using GIS technology, and then the transition among different land use types is analyzed to obtain the transformation matrices during a period of 1976–2006. Meanwhile, an integration evaluation procedure with natural and socioeconomic data is used to generate the transition potential maps. Secondly, using the transition potential maps and transition matrices, a Markov–Cellular Automata model is established to simulate spatial distribution of land use in 2006. Finally, we use this Markov–Cellular Automata model to forecast the future land use changes during the period of 2015–2042. As a consequence, area change simulation predicts a continuing downward trend in agriculture land and forestland areas, as well as an upward trend in built-up areas; spatial distribution simulation indicates that built-up land will expand toward suburban regions, and land use of urban center is at the decline stage. Hence, if the current trends keep constant without holistic sustainable development measures, severe land use decline will ensue. The study is anticipated to help local authorities better understand and address a complex land use system, and develop the improved land use management strategies that can better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation

AB  - AbstractUrban land-use planning is becoming increasingly complex in China because it requires estimating the future urban extent and balancing its various aspects, e.g., provision of enough housing and employment opportunities and preservation of the environment. This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system. In addition to these nonspatial goals, objectives concerning the spatial distrib...

AB  - Land use and land cover is an important component in understanding the interaction of the human activities with the environment and thus it is necessary to be able to simulate such changes. The authors have developed a national scale, integrated, dynamic time-series simulation model called the "Anthropogenically Engineered Transformations of Land Use and Land Cover" (AGENT-LUC) Model, which simulates two major land uses that are influenced by humankind - agritcultural and urban land uses. The land use tranformations are a result of the interaction of the biophysical drivers and human drivers. It applies the concept of the presence of an "agent" as the decision-maker based on the information available to it at a particular point in time and space, in simulating the the land use/cover changes. In the process of development of this model, a new spatial model for population growth and changes has also been developed, which has shown that the land use conditions is a major contributing factor in the migratory tendencies. Model outputs are the changes in the cropping pattern of the agricultural land area, the expansion of the agricultural lands, rural-urban migrations and the spread of the urban areas. The model was applied to the Royal Kingdom of Thailand, at a decadal time step and temporal results will be presented in the paper. The changes are simulated annually and the the entire process is carried out on a grid (1km) basis.

AB  - A system dynamics model is composed of many variables. These variables simplify complex phenomena and provide a description of a system�s current state or problems. Basic variables that describe the real-world urban development can be established from the elements that make up a city�s different dimensions such as industry product, population growth and vacancy rate. The urban development framework takes a system-based approach by systemizing the citys internal elements. The systemic variables then provide not only a clear reflection of the interactions between all of the sub-systems but also how they relate to the overall system. It is therefore very important to select the appropriate variables. Most variables of system dynamics models are, however, set up by the designer, served as a subjective and unscientific approach. This study therefore applies the Fuzzy Delphi Method to the selection process of system variables to increase the confidence of the model. This was accomplished by first examining the system relationships as well as the intent and meaning of the sub-system variables to be created. After establishing the criteria for variable selection, an empirical case study was used to devise the evaluation variables for each sub-system.

AB  - A new, highly flexible model system for the seamless dynamical down-scaling of meteorological and chemical processes from the global to the meso-γ scale is presented. A global model and a cascade of an arbitrary number of limited-area model instances run concurrently in the same parallel environment, in which the coarser grained instances provide the boundary data for the finer grained instances. Thus, disk-space intensive and time consuming intermediate and pre-processing steps are entirely avoided and the time interpolation errors of common off-line nesting approaches are minimised. More specifically, the regional model COSMO of the German Weather Service (DWD) is nested on-line into the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM5 within the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) framework. ECHAM5 and COSMO have previously been equipped with the MESSy infrastructure, implying that the same process formulations (MESSy submodels) are available for both models. This guarantees the highest degree of achievable consistency, between both, the meteorological and chemical conditions at the domain boundaries of the nested limited-area model, and between the process formulations on all scales. The on-line nesting of the different models is established by a client-server approach with the newly developed Multi-Model-Driver (MMD), an additional component of the MESSy infrastructure. With MMD an arbitrary number of model instances can be run concurrently within the same message passing interface (MPI) environment, the respective coarser model (either global or regional) is the server for the nested finer (regional) client model, i.e. it provides the data required to calculate the initial and boundary fields to the client model. On-line nesting means that the coupled (client-server) models exchange their data via the computer memory, in contrast to the data exchange via files on disk in common off-line nesting approaches. MMD consists of a library (Fortran95 and some parts in C) which is based on the MPI standard and two new MESSy submodels, MMDSERV and MMDCLNT (both Fortran95) for the server and client models, respectively. MMDCLNT contains a further sub-submodel, INT2COSMO, for the interpolation of the coarse grid data provided by the server models (either ECHAM5/MESSy or COSMO/MESSy) to the grid of the respective client model (COSMO/MESSy). INT2COSMO is based on the off-line pre-processing tool INT2LM provided by the DWD. The new achievements allow the setup of model cascades for zooming (down-scaling) from the global scale to the lower edge of the meso-γ scale (&approx;1 km) with a very high degree of consistency between the different models and between the chemical and meteorological boundary conditions.

AB  - Land-use change models grounded in complexity theory such as agent- based models (ABMs) are increasingly being used to examine evolving urban systems. The objective of this study is to develop a spatial model that simulates land-use change under the influence of human land-use choice behavior. This is achieved by integrating the key physical and social drivers of land-use change using Bayesian networks (BNs) coupled with agent-based modeling. The BNAS model, integrated Bayesian network–based agent system, presented in this study uses geographic information systems, ABMs, BNs, and influence diagram principles to model population change on an irregular spatial structure. The model is parame- terized with historical data and then used to simulate 20 years of future population and land-use change for the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. The simu- lation results identify feasible new urban areas for development around the main transportation corridors. The obtained new development areas and the projected population trajectories with the‘‘what-if’’ scenario capabilities can provide insights into urban planners for better and more informed land-use policy or decision- making processes.

AB  - This thesis aims to investigate whether host plant resistance and biological control can be effectively integrated through a transgenic approach. Chapter 2 evaluates the biochemical basis of the apparent resistance mechanism of the diamondback moth (DBM; Plutella xylostella) to transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing a mustard trypsin inhibitor 2. Chapter 3 reports a study aiming to make the PPI2-linalool synthase (LIS)' expression cassette with the linalool-introl gene under the control of the potato proteinase inhibitor 2 (PI2) promoter-terminator and its transfer to A. thaliana. Gene presence and transcription are investigated and phenotype expression in terms of linalool emission are assessed. Inducible linalool emission is investigated in response to induction by methyl-jasmonate and DBM feeding. Chapter 4 creates homozygous Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and LIS transgenic A. thaliana and makes crosses to produce lines that incorporate each of the 2 transgenes. The constitutive emission of linalool for P35S-LIS transgenic plants with SPME-GC-MS is investigated. The effects of Bt and LIS single and dual transgenes on DBM are investigated by addressing larval mortality, larval weight, and oviposition choice of P. xylostella moths. In chapter 5, LIS transgenic A. thaliana plants constitutively emitting linalool only and combined with the Bt-transgene are investigated with respect to behaviour of the parasitoids Diadegma semiclausum and Cotesia glomerata. This included induction treatments such as mechanical damage and P. xylostella infestation.

AB  - This paper examines the distinctions between empirical and simulation models using the metaphors of argument and narrative. It argues that all argumentation is contextualized within a narrative that is either inferred or communicated. It provides another semantic structure for urban models that applies elements of systems-dynamic method to construct 'stories' of the past and possible futures of communities in a watershed in southern Arizona. By constructing such narratives this paper demonstrates how computer-based urban models can 'tell a story'.

AB  - This paper proposes a method that facilitates urban water demand modeling estimations where the costumer information system (CIS) is lacking or inadequate, based on a geographic information system (GIS). This method determines a per capita water supply based on socioeconomic status, according to the urban marginalization classification defined for each geo-statical basic area (AGEB), provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in Mexico. For the year of study, 2005, a comparison between water demands estimation by the. Toluca, Mexico, city water agency and this method based on AGEBs information has been done. It can be concluded that problems like an inadequate water distribution could be solved through spatial representations of projected demand. Thus, the water supply strategy design includes an appropriate control tool for the planning and management of water resources. Furthermore, projection and supply water flow monitoring will allow the analysis of water needs by type of use and its reduction within a water-saving culture framework.

AB  - The numerical weather prediction model of the Consortium for Small Scale Modelling (COSMO), maintained by the German weather service (DWD), is connected with the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy). This effort is undertaken in preparation of a new, limited-area atmospheric chemistry model. Limited-area models require lateral boundary conditions for all prognostic variables. Therefore the quality of a regional chemistry model is expected to improve, if boundary conditions for the chemical constituents are provided by the driving model in consistence with the meteorological boundary conditions. The new developed model is as consistent as possible, with respect to atmospheric chemistry and related processes, with a previously developed global atmospheric chemistry general circulation model: the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model. The combined system constitutes a new research tool, bridging the global to the meso-γ scale for atmospheric chemistry research. MESSy provides the infrastructure and includes, among others, the process and diagnostic submodels for atmospheric chemistry simulations. Furthermore, MESSy is highly flexible allowing model setups with tailor made complexity, depending on the scientific question. Here, the connection of the MESSy infrastructure to the COSMO model is documented and also the code changes required for the generalisation of regular MESSy submodels. Moreover, previously published prototype submodels for simplified tracer studies are generalised to be plugged-in and used in the global and the limited-area model. They are used to evaluate the TRACER interface implementation in the new COSMO/MESSy model system and the tracer transport characteristics, an important prerequisite for future atmospheric chemistry applications. A supplementary document with further details on the technical implementation of the MESSy interface into COSMO with a complete list of modifications to the COSMO code is provided.

Our primary focus is on interactive algorithms that can handle a large number of autonomous agents. This includes techniques for automatically computing collision-free trajectories for each agent as well as generating emergent crowd behaviors including lane formation, edge effects, vortices, congestion avoidance, swirling and modeling varying crowd density. Some of these methods map well to current multi-core and many-core processors and we highlight their performance in different urban scenarios.

AB  - Selecting, locating, and managing trees to provide ecosystem services are becoming increasingly important facets of municipal and consulting forestry. The science of urban tree growth modeling is fundamental to quantifying these services. This paper describes three long-term tree growth studies conducted to evaluate tree performance because repeated measurements of the same trees produce critical data for growth model calibration and validation. Several empirical and process-based approaches to modeling tree growth are reviewed. Modeling is more advanced in the fields of forestry and pomology than in urban forestry. The USDA Forest Service's reference city research has developed over 1,800 growth equations from measurements on more than 17,000 trees in 16 cities. The database is a valuable source of information that reflects regional differences in species composition, climate, soils, site conditions, and management practices. Several examples illustrate how differences in local climate and management practices can influence growth of a single species and the resulting value of services. Further advances in urban tree growth modeling are needed to inform the design, management, and modeling of high performing landscapes. © 2012 International Society of Arboriculture.

AB  - Earth System Climate Models (ESCMs) are valuable tools that can be used to gain a better understanding of the climate system, global biogeochemical cycles and how anthropogenically-driven changes may affect them. Here we describe improvements made to the marine biogeochemical ecosystem component of the University of Victoria's ESCM (version 2.9). Major changes include corrections to the code and equations describing phytoplankton light limitation and zooplankton grazing, the implementation of a more realistic zooplankton growth and grazing model, and the implementation of an iron limitation scheme to constrain phytoplankton growth. The new model is evaluated after a 10 000-yr spin-up and compared to both the previous version and observations. For the majority of biogeochemical tracers and ecosystem processes the new model shows significant improvements when compared to the previous version and evaluated against observations. Many of the improvements are due to better simulation of seasonal changes in higher latitude ecosystems and the effect that this has on ocean biogeochemistry. This improved model is intended to provide a basic new ESCM model component, which can be used as is or expanded upon (i.e., the addition of new tracers), for climate change and biogeochemical cycling research.

AB  - Seoul, the capital of South Korea, has been known for its original landscape, which has been molded for centuries within and around the surrounding natural topography. As a result of rapid urbanization and growth beginning in the 1960s, however, there has been significant deterioration. New and re-development in the downtown area, which have been characterized as high-rise and massive in particular, have been and are continuing to be detrimental to the landscape. In recent years, a number of attempts towards urban landscape management have emerged in the form of legislation and policies. But relevant tools to support the implementation of such attempts have unfortunately been insufficient, resulting in inefficient, unsystematic, and inaccurate urban landscape management efforts. Subsequently, this study developed the LandScape Information System (LSIS) for the purpose of managing urban landscape information and analyzing visual impacts of proposed development projects. Employing Geographic Information System (GIS) and computer graphics simulation techniques, LSIS performs such functions as, input and management of graphic and attribute data, query analysis of attributes related to urban landscape elements, and visual impact (view obstruction) analysis of development proposals. The database for LSIS was prepared in consideration to the urban information systems (UIS) database framework of Seoul in order to ensure the maximum data transferability between them. Through the application of LSIS to a sample visual impact analysis of urban redevelopment projects, it was found that valuable landscape resources could be damaged by the proposed projects. Moreover, by using LSIS, subsequent mitigation measures for such impacts could be effectively tested and developed. Therefore, it is believed that in general, LSIS can be used as the basis for decision-making in resolving urban landscape problems experienced by local governments. In addition, with the trend toward promoting more information-based societies, LSIS can be instrumental in sharing substantial amounts of data with those for UIS, developed by central and local governments. This in turn can foster maximum effectiveness and value of computer-based urban landscape management. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - La Rochelle, France witnessed an important growth of its permanent and seasonal population during the second half of the twentieth century. Its attractive coastal position is the main reason for this increase, which led to a massive urban spread, particularly in La Rochelle peripheral municipalities. Which are the strategies used by local public authorities to take into account social and environmental problems? While it has been very innovative since 1970 in regard to urban ecology and sustainable development, does La Rochelle still have today the capacity to tend towards the "ideal sustainable city"? On the contrary, is La Rochelle powerless, or even more complicit in the urban sprawl phenomenon? The purpose of this paper is to focus on one factor that particularly influences urban growth: local urban policies and planning strategies through planning documents analysis. For this, an urban growth model based on a cellular automata paradigm is used. In this model, the space is described as a grid, for each non built cell, with a graduated probability of building. This probability of building is based on the analysis of planning rules (e.g. urban planning regulation framework). The example of the correlation between these planning rules and local urban growth is described in this paper. The model enables the simulation of alternative urban growth scenarios. It helps one to estimate how alternative planning could affect non built areas. This model aims at helping the elaboration of future planning documents. The control of La Rochelle's urban spread is one of the main stakes to be taken into account in the future land development plan (Schema de COherence Territoriale: SCOT). The SCOT is currently being elaborated in La Rochelle. © 2010 WIT Press.

AB  - A variety of indices have been proposed to facilitate the quantitative analysis in remote sensing applications. The assessment of land development is important for minimizing development impacts and formulating alternative development plans. Much attention has been paid to the quantity of land use changes in general development assessment using remote sensing. However, additional information can be obtained from remote sensing and GIS for revealing land use problems more effectively. This paper presents four indicators, quantity, quality, location, and morphology,to characterize land development patterns for fast-growing regions. A four-component efficiency index is further developed for ranking purposes to reflect economic and environmental considerations. The implementation of the method has been demonstrated in a fast-growing region in south China. Efforts have been made to verify the model with independent empirical data

AB  - Urban evolution model is an assistant analysis method for urban planning which can effectively trace the urban development process of the past and predict the possible evolution scenarios in the future. This paper proposed urban spatial system dynamic model (USSD model) by coupling strategy between Geographic Information System (GIS) and urban System Dynamic (SD). GIS can deal with the static spatial relationships while SD can deal with the dynamic relationships of complex spatial system. This new urban expansion model can predict the expansion scenarios in the future according to tracing the urban development of the past. It considered the spatial relationships among urban system elements as well as the dynamic links and interactions among the spatial elements over time. It is achieved through a dynamic data exchange between GIS and SD. Firstly we analyzed urban system by using five subsystems: population, resources, transportation, land usage and soil erosion. Secondly, we have developed USSD model based on dynamic links among the subsystems. Thirdly, we have created five layers in GIS and operated them in the USSD model. Finally, a case study illustrated the USSD model in Wuhan city. It is concluded that the USSD model is an efficient tool for forecasting the urban expansion with its advantages on dealing with the spatio-temporal problem. © 2008 SPIE.

AB  - In the context of rapid urbanization, accurate assessment of urban growth has become increasingly necessary for understanding environmental impacts and supporting urban planning toward a sustainable development. in this paper, we present an integrated system dynamics and cellular automata model not only in socio-economic driving forces analysis but also in urban spatial pattern evaluation. Shanghai city in China is selected as a case to fulfill the tasks. The major findings are summarized as follows: (1) the integrated model is proved to be competent in monitoring and projecting the dynamics of urban growth. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the urban area of Shanghai is predicted to increase at an annual rate of 3%. and amount 1474 km(2) in 2020. Spatially, the newly increased urban land is most likely to expand around the vicinity of city center or sub-centers, and mainly along a west-east axis and a north-south axis. Road network planning plays an important role in directing the development of newly urbanized land. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cities impact both local climate, through urban heat islands and global\nclimate, because they are an area of heavy greenhouse gas release\ninto the atmosphere due to heating, air conditioning and traffic.\nIncluding more vegetation into cities is a planning strategy having\npossible positive impacts for both concerns. Improving vegetation\nrepresentation into urban models will allow us to address more accurately\nthese questions. This paper presents an improvement of the Town Energy\nBalance (TEB) urban canopy model. Vegetation is directly included\ninside the canyon, allowing shadowing of grass by buildings, better\nrepresentation of urban canopy form and, a priori, a more accurate\nsimulation of canyon air microclimate. The surface exchanges over\nvegetation are modelled with the well-known Interaction Soil Biosphere\nAtmosphere (ISBA) model that is integrated in the TEB's code architecture\nin order to account for interactions between natural and built-up\ncovers. The design of the code makes possible to plug and use any\nvegetation scheme. Both versions of TEB are confronted to experimental\ndata issued from a field campaign conducted in Israel in 2007. Two\nsemi-enclosed courtyards arranged with bare soil or watered lawn\nwere instrumented to evaluate the impact of landscaping strategies\non microclimatic variables and evapotranspiration. For this case\nstudy, the new version of the model with integrated vegetation performs\nbetter than if vegetation is treated outside the canyon. Surface\ntemperatures are closer to the observations, especially at night\nwhen radiative trapping is important. The integrated vegetation version\nsimulates a more humid air inside the canyon. The microclimatic quantities\n(i.e., the street-level meteorological variables) are better simulated\nwith this new version. This opens opportunities to study with better\naccuracy the urban microclimate, down to the micro (or canyon) scale.

AB  - This report documents a Newton formulation of MODFLOW-2005, called MODFLOW-NWT. MODFLOW- NWT is a standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW- NWT must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF; Anderman and Hill, 2000) Packages. TheUPW Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. The GMRES Solver is documented in a previously published report, such that only a brief description and input instructions are provided in this report. However, the CGSTAB Solver (called χMD) is documented in this report. Flow-property input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. This report presents the theory and methods used by MODFLOW-NWT,including the UPW Package. Additionally, this report provides comparisons of the new methodology to analytical solutions of groundwater flow and to standard MODFLOW-2005 results by use of an unconfined aquifer MODFLOW example problem. The standard MODFLOW-2005 simulation uses the LPF Package with the wet/dry option active. A new example problem also is presented to demonstrate MODFLOW- NWT’s ability to provide a solution for a difficult unconfined groundwater-flow problem.

AB  - In this paper we present methods developed to aid the application of modal analysis to large system dynamics models. The approach is based on a method of direct linearization which can be achieved using DYNAMO equations derived from the model being studied. The linearization is followed by identification of the sub-systems of the model and a modal analysis of the sub-systems. The sensitivities of the modes to structural and parameter changes are used along with a causal loop diagrams to propose changes in the model that will have a desired dynamic effect. Application is made to Lyneis' model of a firm. As suggested by the analysis, modifications both in the polarity of some relationships and in their strength are introduced to stabilize each sub-system and the results are shown to be positive using the criterion of over-all profitability of the model firm. The paper concludes with a discussion of further developments of the process and to account more completely for the non-linearity of the system.

AB  - Based on the theories of the information entropy of urban land use structure, co-integration and error correction model, this thesis analyses the relationship between economic growth, urbanization level and the information entropy of urban land use structure. The information entropy values of China's urban land use structure from 1981 to 2004 have been calculated in this paper. The relationship between China's GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is investigated in details. The results indicate a co-integration relationship between GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure. However, there is no co-integration relationship between urbanization and the information entropy of urban land use structure. On the basis of the above analyses, the error correction model on GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is instituted. The application of the model shows that every 1% decrease in the information entropy value of urban land use structure demands a 59.53% growth in GDP. Because of the existing co-integration relationship between the economic growth and the information entropy of urban land use structure, the order degree of China's urban land use structure has relied heavily on the economic growth for a long time. The economic growth will significantly affect the optimal regulation of urban land use structure in the future. Further investigation also shows that economic growth and urbanization act as the direct driving force of the optimization of urban land use structure, but the optimization of urban land use structure can't promote the economic growth and the urbanization. Therefore, it becomes a very pressing strategic issue to adjust the economic structure and industrial distribution to optimize the distribution of urban land use and to optimize the structure of urban land use to improve the efficiency and promote the socio-economic development.

AB  - Constrained cellular automata (CA) are frequently used for modeling land use change and urban growth. In these models land use dynamics are generated by a set of cell state transition rules that incorporate a neighborhood effect. Generally, neighborhoods are relatively small and therefore only a limited amount of spatial information is included. In this study a variable grid CA is implemented to allow incorporation of more spatial information in a computationally efficient way. This approach aggregates land uses at greater distances, in accordance with a hierarchical concept of space. More remote areas are aggregated into consecutively larger areas. Therefore the variable grid CA is capable of simulating regional as well as local dynamics at the same time. The variable grid CA is used here to model urban growth in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) between 1996 and 2001. Calibration results are tested for goodness of fit at the cellular level by means of the kappa statistic and for land use patterns by means of cluster size analysis and radial analysis. Kappa results show that the model performs considerably better than a neutral allocation model. Cluster and radial analysis indicate that the model is capable of producing realistic urban growth patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We developed a complex Earth system model by coupling terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycle components into the Bergen Climate Model. For this study, we have generated two model simulations (one with climate change inclusions and the other without) to study the large scale climate and carbon cycle variability as well as its feedback for the period 18502100. The simulations are performed based on historical and future IPCC CO2 emission scenarios. Globally, a pronounced positive climate-carbon cycle feedback is simulated by the terrestrial carbon cycle model, but smaller signals are shown by the oceanic counterpart. Over land, the regional climate-carbon cycle feedback is highlighted by increased soil respiration, which exceeds the enhanced production due to the atmospheric CO2 fertilization effect, in the equatorial and northern hemisphere mid-latitude regions. For the ocean, our analysis indicates that there are substantial temporal and spatial variations in climate impact on the air-sea CO2 fluxes. This implies feedback mechanisms act inhomogeneously in different ocean regions. In the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, the simulated future cooling of SST improves the CO2 gas solubility in seawater and, hence, reduces the strength of positive climate carbon cycle feedback in this region. In most ocean regions, the changes in the Revelle factor is dominated by changes in surface pCO2, and not by the warming of SST. Therefore, the solubility-associated positive feedback is more prominent than the buffer capacity feedback. In our climate change simulation, the retreat of Southern Ocean sea ice due to melting allows an additional ~20 Pg C uptake as compared to the simulation without climate change.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - A wide variety of different plankton system models have been coupled with ocean circulation models, with the aim of understanding and predicting aspects of environmental change. However, an ability to make reliable inferences about real-world processes from the model behaviour demands a quantitative understanding of model error that remains elusive. Assessment of coupled model output is inhibited by relatively limited observing system coverage of biogeochemical components. Any direct assessment of the plankton model is further inhibited by uncertainty in the physical state. Furthermore, comparative evaluation of plankton models on the basis of their design is inhibited by the sensitivity of their dynamics to many adjustable parameters. Parameter uncertainty has been widely addressed by calibrating models at data-rich ocean sites. However, relatively little attention has been given to quantifying uncertainty in the physical fields required by the plankton models at these sites, and tendencies in the biogeochemical properties due to the effects of horizontal processes are often neglected. 

Here we use model twin experiments, in which synthetic data are assimilated to estimate a system's known "true" parameters, to investigate the impact of error in a plankton model's environmental input data. The experiments are supported by a new software tool, the Marine Model Optimization Testbed, designed for rigorous analysis of plankton models in a multi-site 1-D framework. Simulated errors are derived from statistical characterizations of the mixed layer depth, the horizontal flux divergence tendencies of the biogeochemical tracers and the initial state. Plausible patterns of uncertainty in these data are shown to produce strong temporal and spatial variability in the expected simulation error variance over an annual cycle, indicating variation in the significance attributable to individual model-data differences. An inverse scheme using ensemble-based estimates of the simulation error variance to allow for this environment error performs well compared with weighting schemes used in previous calibration studies, giving improved estimates of the known parameters. The efficacy of the new scheme in real-world applications will depend on the quality of statistical characterizations of the input data. Practical approaches towards developing reliable characterizations are discussed.

AB  - <Risk analysis can be defined as the evaluation of the probability of end events interpreted in terms of sequences of earlier events. In fisheries science, stock assessment provides future projections on which management decisions can be based. Uncertainties in estimating input parameters for such projections are considerable. For the assessment problem the authors propose an event tree analysis that couches the uncertainty of projections in terms of relative risk associated with various management options. As an illustration they rephrase the stock assessment advice given in 1980 for the Georges Bank haddock stock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus L.) in the framework of event tree analysis. This method is also examined for a second species: the Gulf of Mexico menhaden (Brevoortia patronus ).

Based on the developed model, characteristics of global traffic patterns in urban areas are studied. Our results show that different control mechanisms used at intersections such as cycle duration, green split, and coordination of traffic lights have a significant effect on intervehicle spacing distribution and traffic dynamics. These findings provide important insights into the network connectivity behavior of urban traffic, which are essential for designing appropriate routing protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks in urban scenarios.

This enables (semi-) automated processes, and they are therefore high potential for an improved quality management and seamless IT support. Surprisingly, there are no published process models that describe the implementation of clinical pathways in an information system while taking into account the characteristics of health care specifics. We bridge this gap by proposing a process model using UML as modeling language.

AB  - At present, environmental issues associated with rapid economic development are becoming critical concerns that arouse government's and people's particular attention. A large amount of influencing factors and especially their complicated interactions have always thrown confused insights into assessing the dynamic evolvement and sustainable development of urban economy-resource- environment (ERE) system and programming the developing strategies. A combination of system dynamics (SD) and geographic information system (GIS) is expected to explicitly understand the synergic interaction and feedback among a variety of influencing factors in time and space, since SD model can extend the spatial analysis functions of GIS to realize both dynamic simulation and trend prediction of an ERE system development. According to connotation and framework of sustainable development, this study proposes a dynamic combination method of SD-GIS to model and evaluate the urban development in Chongqing city of China suffering from depletion of resource and degradation of environment. To compare different policy inclinations with regard to potential ERE effects, typical scenarios (current, resource, technology and environment scenarios) are designed by adjusting the parameters in the model and changing the specification of some variables. Integrated assessment results indicate that the current ERE system of Chongqing is not sustainable; environment scenario is more effective to sustainable development of urban ERE system in a long run. Under the considerations of development features and regional differences, as well as regular discipline on urbanization, a coordinated combination of environmental, resource and technology scenarios is anticipated to realize sustainable development of urban ERE system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, due to the urban activities cause impacts not only on local level but also a broader scale, a simulation model, using System Dynamics (SD) methodology, was structured to quantitatively investigate the developmental tendency of housing demand and supply. And then the estimated results were displayed in ArcGIS and CityEngine. The integration of GIS and SD model can better explain the interaction and the variation with time of the sustainable indicators for residential development. Hence it’s able to support the Decision Maker to view the sustainable level of urban residential areas more comprehensively.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop an urban land-use-demand forecast model using a metropolitan input-output model and gravity-type spatial interaction models. The feasibility of the proposed model is tested with actual data from the Seoul metropolitan area by estimating the effects of urban-growth-control policy on urban economy, employment, population, and land-use demand. Three main features are highlighted: (1) the proposed model can estimate and project urban land-use demand on a firm theoretical foundation because land-use demand is determined by the interindustrial and interspatial relations of production, income formation, and consumption through metropolitan input-output multipliers; (2) the proposed model has practical advantages over other urban land-use models in terms of operational cost because it is relatively easy to operate within the input-output framework and it has fewer requirements of data and parameter calibration; and (3) the proposed model has the capability to incorporate changes in attractiveness, accessibility, land availability, and other policy variables in projecting and estimating urban land-use demand, which is an important feature for policy evaluation. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed model as an urban-policy evaluation tool, which provides significant implications to urban policy analysts. The simulation results indicate that a growth-control policy decreases output and employment for the overall urban economy. The model results also show that a city with a growth-control policy is negatively impacted with regards to output, employment, population, and residential and nonresidential land-use demand, whereas the surrounding cities receive positive spillover effects due to the land-use regulation.

AB  - The objective of this study is to document and evaluate recent changes and updates to the module for aerosols and aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions in the atmospheric module CAM4-Oslo of the core version of the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM), NorESM1-M. Particular attention is paid to the role of natural organics, sea salt, and mineral dust in determining the gross aerosol properties as well as the anthropogenic contribution to these properties and the associated direct and indirect radiative forcing. The aerosol module is extended from earlier versions that have been published, and includes life-cycling of sea salt, mineral dust, particulate sulphate, black carbon, and primary and secondary organics. The impacts of most of the numerous changes since previous versions are thoroughly explored by sensitivity experiments. The most important changes are: modified prognostic sea salt emissions; updated treatment of precipitation scavenging and gravitational settling; inclusion of biogenic primary organics and methane sulphonic acid (MSA) from oceans; almost doubled production of land-based biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA); and increased ratio of organic matter to organic carbon (OM/OC) for biomass burning aerosols from 1.4 to 2.6. Compared with in situ measurements and remotely sensed data, the new treatments of sea salt and dust aerosols give smaller biases in near-surface mass concentrations and aerosol optical depth than in the earlier model version. The model biases for mass concentrations are approximately unchanged for sulphate and BC. The enhanced levels of modeled OM yield improved overall statistics, even though OM is still underestimated in Europe and overestimated in North America. The global anthropogenic aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) at the top of the atmosphere has changed from a small positive value to −0.08 W m−2 in CAM4-Oslo. The sensitivity tests suggest that this change can be attributed to the new treatment of biomass burning aerosols and gravitational settling. Although it has not been a goal in this study, the new DRF estimate is closer both to the median model estimate from the AeroCom intercomparison and the best estimate in IPCC AR4. Estimated DRF at the ground surface has increased by ca. 60%, to −1.89 W m−2. We show that this can be explained by new emission data and omitted mixing of constituents between updrafts and downdrafts in convective clouds. The increased abundance of natural OM and the introduction of a cloud droplet spectral dispersion formulation are the most important contributions to a considerably decreased estimate of the indirect radiative forcing (IndRF). The IndRF is also found to be sensitive to assumptions about the coating of insoluble aerosols by sulphate and OM. The IndRF of −1.2 W m−2, which is closer to the IPCC AR4 estimates than the previous estimate of −1.9 W m−2, has thus been obtained without imposing unrealistic artificial lower bounds on cloud droplet number concentrations.

AB  - Reproductive behavior, physiology, and ecology affect the number of offspring that an individual butterfly contributes to the next generation; therefore, these factors play an integral mechanistic role in influencing population and evolutionary dynamics. Critical questions include, how do males and females find each other and select mates? Why have particular mating systems evolved? What are the nutrient sources for offspring production and how much should females or males invest in each offspring? What determines temporal patterns of egg production? How do all these tie together to influence lifetime reproductive success? And how are these decisions influenced by the environment and by selection? Untangling the answers to these general questions for insects and placing those answers in an appropriate evolutionary and ecological context requires a solid understanding of the reproductive biology of a set of model insect species. Ideally, the biology of these species should span a range of mating behaviors and numbers, feeding habits, ovarian dynamics and parental care, and age-specific reproductive and survival values to facilitate comparative studies (Boggs 1986). Due to contrasts with other butterflies, checkerspots have proven useful as one model group of species within the set used to address these questions. For Euphydl'yas editha bayensis in particular, the number of matings by females is generally low, the adult diet is nutritionally incomplete, and females emerge with a fixed number of oocytes in the ovaries, a relatively large percentage of which are chorionated and ready to be laid (Labine 1964, 1968, Boggs 1997b). Contrasting species include some Heliconius, whose females may mate many times, eat a nutritionally complete adult diet, exhibit continual oogenesis throughout life, and emerge with no eggs chorionated (Gilbert 1973, Dunlap-Pianka et al. 1977, Boggs 1990). Equally important, E. editha was also the subject of early studies on male and female reproductive success as outlined below, laying a framework for understanding these aspects of reproductive"biology in insects. In this chapter, we synthesize the contributions of checkerspot studies to OUf understanding of sex ratios, mating strategies, reproductive allocation, and lifetime reproductive success. Along the way, we show how reproductive biology connects to the broader issues of population and evolutionary dynamics as well as conservation and highlight key unanswered questions that could be addressed with the checkers pot system.

AB  - Spring algal development in deep temperate lakes is thought to be strongly influenced by surface irradiance, vertical mixing and temperature, all of which are expected to be altered by climate change. Based on long-term data from Lake Constance, we investigated the individual and combined effects of these variables on algal dynamics using descriptive statistics, multiple regression models and a process-oriented dynamic simulation model. The latter considered edible and less-edible algae and was forced by observed or anticipated irradiance, temperature and vertical mixing intensity. Unexpectedly, irradiance often dominated algal net growth rather than vertical mixing for the following reason: algal dynamics depended on algal net losses from the euphotic layer to larger depth due to vertical mixing. These losses strongly depended on the vertical algal gradient which, in turn, was determined by the mixing intensity during the previous days, thereby introducing a memory effect. This observation implied that during intense mixing that had already reduced the vertical algal gradient, net losses due to mixing were small. Consequently, even in deep Lake Constance, the reduction in primary production due to low light was often more influential than the net losses due to mixing. In the regression model, the dynamics of small, fast-growing algae was best explained by vertical mixing intensity and global irradiance, whereas those of larger algae were best explained by their biomass 1 week earlier. The simulation model additionally revealed that even in late winter grazing may represent an important loss factor during calm periods when losses due to mixing are small. The importance of losses by mixing and grazing changed rapidly as it depended on the variable mixing intensity. Higher temperature, lower global irradiance and enhanced mixing generated lower algal biomass and primary production in the dynamic simulation model. This suggests that potential consequences of climate change may partly counteract each other.

AB  - This study applied logistic regression to model urban growth in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area of Georgia in a GIS environment and to discover the relationship between urban growth and the driving forces. Historical land use/cover data of Atlanta were extracted from the 1987 and 1997 Landsat TM images. Multi-resolution calibration of a series of logistic regression models was conducted from 50 m to 300 m at intervals of 25 m. A fractal analysis pointed to 225 m as the optimal resolution of modeling. The following two groups of factors were found to affect urban growth in different degrees as indicated by odd ratios: (1) population density, distances to nearest urban clusters, activity centers and roads, and high/low density urban uses (all with odds ratios < 1); and (2) distance to the CBD, number of urban cells within a 7 ?? 7 cell window, bare land, crop/grass land, forest, and UTM northing coordinate (all with odds ratios > 1). A map of urban growth probability was calculated and used to predict future urban patterns. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.85 indicates that the probability map is valid. It was concluded that despite logistic regression's lack of temporal dynamics, it was spatially explicit and suitable for multi-scale analysis, and most importantly, allowed much deeper understanding of the forces driving the growth and the formation of the urban spatial pattern. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Irtually all of the growth in the worlds population for the foreseeable future will take place in the cities and towns of the developing world. Over the next twenty years, most developing countries will for the first time become more urban than rural. The benefits from urbanization cannot be overlooked, but the speed and sheer scale of this transformation present many challenges. A new cast of policy makers is emerging to take up the many responsibilities of urban governanceas many national governments decentralize and devolve their functions, programs in poverty, health, education, and public services are increasingly being deposited in the hands of untested municipal and regional governments. Demographers have been surprisingly slow to devote attention to the implications of the urban transformation. Drawing from a wide variety of data sources, many of them previously inaccessible, Cities Transformed explores the implications of various urban contexts for marriage, fertility, health, schooling, and childrens lives. It should be of interest to all involved in city-level research, policy, planning, and investment decisions.

AB  - The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model is a coupled general circulation model, designed primarily for millennial-scale climate simulation and palaeoclimate research. Mk3L includes components which describe the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface, and combines computational efficiency with a stable and realistic control climatology. It is freely available to the research community. This paper evaluates the response of the model to external forcings which correspond to past and future changes in the climate system. A simulation of the mid-Holocene climate is performed, in which changes in the seasonal and meridional distribution of incoming solar radiation are imposed. Mk3L correctly simulates increased summer temperatures at northern mid-latitudes and cooling in the tropics. However, it is unable to capture some of the regional-scale features of the mid-Holocene climate, with the precipitation over Northern Africa being deficient. The model simulates a reduction of between 7 and 15% in the amplitude of El Niño-Southern Oscillation, a smaller decrease than that implied by the palaeoclimate record. However, the realism of the simulated ENSO is limited by the model's relatively coarse spatial resolution. Transient simulations of the late Holocene climate are then performed. The evolving distribution of insolation is imposed, and an acceleration technique is applied and assessed. The model successfully captures the temperature changes in each hemisphere and the upward trend in ENSO variability. However, the lack of a dynamic vegetation scheme does not allow it to simulate an abrupt desertification of the Sahara. To assess the response of Mk3L to other forcings, transient simulations of the last millennium are performed. Changes in solar irradiance, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and volcanic emissions are applied to the model. The model is again broadly successful at simulating larger-scale changes in the climate system. Both the magnitude and the spatial pattern of the simulated 20th century warming are consistent with observations. However, the model underestimates the magnitude of the relative warmth associated with the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly. Finally, three transient simulations are performed, in which the atmospheric CO 2 concentration is stabilised at two, three and four times the pre-industrial value. All three simulations exhibit ongoing surface warming, reduced sea ice cover, and a reduction in the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water formation followed by its gradual recovery. Antarctic Bottom Water formation ceases, with the shutdown being permanent for a trebling and quadrupling of the CO 2 concentration. The transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities of the model are determined. The short-term transient response to a doubling of the CO 2 concentration at 1% per year is a warming of 1.59 ± 0.08 K, while the long-term equilibrium response is a warming of at least 3.85 ± 0.02 K. © 2012 Author(s).

AB  - The symbiotic nitrogen fixation process occurs in nodules in which the prokaryotic endophyte is physically separated from the plant cytoplasm. This separation requires the transport of carbon metabolites to the bacteria and reduced nitrogen metabolites to the plant. Dicarboxylic acids, primarily malate, are actively transported to the bacteroids and, until recently, ammonia was believed to be the primary nitrogen metabolite, which moved to the plant via diffusion. Recent evidence demonstrated that alanine is the nitrogen metabolite released by the nitrogen-fixing bacteroids from soyabeans. The rapid and efficient transport of alanine to the plant portion of the nodule implies that a nutrient exchange cycle may exist within soyabean root nodules facilitating the exchange of carbon and nitrogen metabolites.

AB  - Shenyang and Fushun are two most nearest mega cities in China. Integration of the two cities as one sub-administrative economic region is a state and province policy to promote economy development of Liaoning province. How the urban patterns of the mega cities will grow is interested to city planners, decision-makers, land managers, ecologists, geographers, and resource managers because it's special policy and spatiotemporal dynamic complexity. This study explore the combined application of remote sensing, geographical information system and SLEUTH urban growth model to analyze and model urban growth pattern in Shenyang-Fushun metropolitan area northeastern China. The sequential RS images can give quantitative descriptors of the geometry of urban form to be computed and compared over time. The investigation is based on a 16-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical TM satellite imagery. The SLEUTH model was calibrated using the mutil-temporal data set for the 6391.12km2 area where has experienced rapid urbanization in recent years. The model allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth, and future growth was projected out to 2050 assuming four different policy scenarios: (1) current trends (CT), (2) accelerated urban development (AUD), (3) protected urban development (PUD), and (4) limitative urban growth (LUD). The predicted urban growth shows similar compact pattern under each scenario except the current trends scenario that shows diffused urban growth pattern and most diffused growth appears at south of region. Edge growth and road gravity growth are the main growth types in the future. The accelerated urban development scenario shows the most urban growth area. The limitative urban growth scenario shows the least urban growth area. The protected urban development scenario shows moderate urban growth area and good protection to other land resources. The urban land of two mega cities will connect firstly to a whole on the south bank of Hun River about in 2040 in the accelerated urban development and the current trends scenarios, and will not connect on the other two scenarios until 2050. The combined method using remote sensing, geographical information system and SLEUTH urban growth model is powerful for representation, modeling and prediction of the spatiotemporal urban growth, and useful for understanding the alternative future planning scenarios, but location accuracy and scenarios design must be further considered for local application. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - Where to get data for urban planning and management is one issue, but how to manage these data is still a challenging task. This article focuses on the technical issue of managing data. The core data for urban planning are land-use data, which, if updated frequently, raises the issue of structuring, storing, querying, and displaying the data. Modeling, querying, and displaying changes in land-use data have been a challenge for many designers and urban planners. We propose a novel approach to model land-use changes based on object-oriented concepts and a mathematical theory of cell complexes. For object-oriented concepts, the Unified Modeling Language is used. Each land use is considered as an object. This object is an instance of the SpatioTemporalAttributeClass, which is the aggregation of SpatialClass, TemporalClass, and AttributeClass. The AttributeClass is a metaclass of LanduseClass and EvidenceClass. This article focuses on the AttributeClass (land use). The two types of land uses considered here are detailed and general land use. Detailed land use is recorded at the parcel level, while general land use does not require parcel information. Parcel-level land use is indispensable for many operational and strategic planning exercises. An object-relational approach is employed to achieve the model at the logical level. This approach may help alleviate the accessibility problem of land-use data in an urban environment. Through Structured Query Language, it is demonstrated how the spatiotemporal queries can be made.

AB  - The SLEUTH model (slope, landuse, exclusion, urban extent, transportation and hillshade), formerly called the Clarke Cellular Automaton Urban Growth Model, was developed for and tested on various cities in North America, including Washington, DC, and San Francisco. In contrast, this research calibrated the SLEUTH model for two European cities, the Portuguese metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto. The SLEUTH model is a cellular automaton model, developed with predefined growth rules applied spatially to gridded maps of the cities in a set of nested loops, and was designed to be both scaleable and universally applicable. Urban expansion is modeled in a modified two-dimensional regular grid. Maps of topographic slope, land use, exclusions, urban extents, road transportation, and a graphic hillshade layer form the model input. This paper examines differences in the model's behavior when the obviously different environment of a European city is captured in the data and modeled. Calibration results are included and interpreted in the context of the two cities, and an evaluation of the model's portability and universality of application is made. Questions such as scalability, sequential multistage optimization by automated exploration of model parameter space, the problem of equifinality, and parameter sensitivity to local conditions are explored. The metropolitan areas present very different spatial and developmental characteristics. The Lisbon Metropolitan Area (the capital of Portugal) has a mix of north Atlantic and south Mediterranean influences. Property is organized in large patches of extensive farmland comprised of olive and cork orchards. The urban pattern of Lisbon and its environs is characterized by rapid urban sprawl, focused in the urban centers of Lisbon, Oeiras, Cascais Set??bal, and Almada, and by intense urbanization along the main road and train lines radiating from the major urban centers. The Porto Metropolitan Area is characterized by a coastal Atlantic landscape. The urban pattern is concentrated among the main nuclei (Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia) and scattered among many small rural towns and villages. There are very small isolated patches of intensive agriculture and pine forests in a topography of steep slopes. These endogenous territorial characteristics go back in time to the formation of Portugal - with a "Roman-Visigod North" and an "Arabic South" [Firmino, 1999 (Firmino, A., 1999. Agriculture and landscape in portugal. Landscape and Urban planning, 46, 83-91); Ribeiro, Lautensach, & Daveau, 1991 (Ribeiro, O., Lautensach, H., & Daveau, S., 1991. Geografia de portugal (4 Vols., published between 1986 and 1991). Lisbon, Portugal: Jo??o S?? de Costa)]. The SLEUTH model calibration captured these city characteristics, and using the standard documented calibration procedures, seems to have adapted itself well to the European context. Useful predictions of growth to 2025, and investigation of the impact of planning and transportation construction can be investigated as a consequence of the successful calibration. Further application and testing of the SLEUTH model in non-Western environments may prove it to be the elusive universal model of urban growth, the antithesis of the special case urban models of the 1960s and 1970s. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Degrees (the number of links attached to a given node) play a particular and important role in empirical network analysis because of their obvious importance for expressing the position of nodes. It is argued here that there is no general straightforward relation between the degree distribution on one hand and structural aspects on the other hand, as this relation depends on further characteristics of the presumed model for the network. Therefore empirical inference from observed network characteristics to the processes that could be responsible for network genesis and dynamics cannot be based only, or mainly, on the observed degree distribution.

AB  - Land-cover and land-use (LCLU) change was quantified for the last 35 years within and in the vicinity of a fast growing city in Mexico, using rectified aerial photographs and geographic information systems (GIS). LCLU change was projected for the next 20 years using Markov chains and regression analyses. The study explored the relationships between urban growth and landscape change, and between urban growth and population growth. The analysis of Markov matrices suggests that the highest LCLU attractor is the city of Morelia, followed by plantations and croplands. Grasslands and shrublands are the least stable categories. The most powerful use of the Markov transition matrices seems to be at the descriptive rather than the predictive level. Linear regression between urban and population growth offered a more robust prediction of urban growth in Morelia. Hence, we suggest that linear regression should be used when projecting growth tendencies of cities in regions with similar characteristics.

AB  - Rather than a bad case of urban sprawl, the physical expansion of China's megacities may be viewed as a combination of 'urban spill over' and 'local urban sprawl'. This paper reviews land use regulations in their institutional context and argues that conflicts in land use regulation are related to ideologies of land ownership and embedded in different planning doctrines. These hypotheses are investigated with special reference to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. The evidence suggests that entangled land use regulations for "urban" and "rural" land have imposed serious constraints on urban growth, while the contradictions of different policies and regulations in the use of rural lands for urban construction have led to intensive and unhealthy competition among stakeholders. As a result, not only have the costs of land conversion from rural to urban uses increased, but the spatial development of Guangzhou has been distorted. The implications of these failures for future policy are discussed with emphasis on the reform of the land use regulation system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Literature suggests that present urban design plans and methods are inadequate to deal with the scale and complexity of contemporary urban form and multidisciplinary collaborative practice. Although recent developments in urban modeling technologies have brought about a wide range of different techniques and potential implementations that may help address this inadequacy, they have not yet made their desired impact on the design process. Failure to use these capabilities extensively in actual practice may result primarily from a limited understanding of the proper role these tools should play or the impact they may have. There is also hesitation about which are appropriate and effective applications, and little consensus on the methods with which these capabilities should be used in core design activities. More investigation is needed to understand fully their application in urban design practice. This research suggests a methodological framework underlying the methods of using various urban modeling functionalities. A questionnaire survey method was used to document the methods and assess the extents to which designers used urban modeling tools in developing eight urban design plans. The questionnaire survey findings were compared with the theoretical premises. The findings showed that design methodology is the main factor that affects the effectiveness of modeling to support design activities. The findings showed extensive, inconsistent usage and various degrees of support for design activities that resulted in various degrees of impact on urban design aspects. The findings suggest the provision of dynamic visualization supported by efficient networking may advance urban modeling to become a tool of public advocacy and design decision support which can advance urban design practice to informational, communicational, and representational systems.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - We describe here the development and evaluation of an Earth system model suitable for centennial-scale climate prediction. The principal new components added to the physical climate model are the terrestrial and ocean ecosystems and gas-phase tropospheric chemistry, along with their coupled interactions. The individual Earth system components are described briefly and the relevant interactions between the components are explained. Because the multiple interactions could lead to unstable feedbacks, we go through a careful process of model spin up to ensure that all components are stable and the interactions balanced. This spun-up configuration is evaluated against observed data for the Earth system components and is generally found to perform very satisfactorily. The reason for the evaluation phase is that the model is to be used for the core climate simulations carried out by the Met Office Hadley Centre for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), so it is essential that addition of the extra complexity does not detract substantially from its climate performance. Localised changes in some specific meteorological variables can be identified, but the impacts on the overall simulation of present day climate are slight. This model is proving valuable both for climate predictions, and for investigating the strengths of biogeochemical feedbacks.

AB  - Urban growth refers to an increase in the absolute of people living in urban areas and the spatial expansion of those urban areas. The study of the past and present situations of an area gives the influential factors on the pattern of urban growth. In fact, it is possible to predict the future pattern if the growth can be properly modeled. The urban environmental problems are usually valid to a specific area (locally) because most of the land area is depended on its geography, social, economic and policy factors. The factors may be different from one place to another. In this paper, we propose a generic solution to detect urban growth pattern for any region of interest by using pixel-based approach. Digital images are captured using satellites. The images are processed using Geographical Information System (GIS) to classify the urban and rural areas. A Cellular Automata (CA) theory is applied to determine the states of all pixels before filtration and selection on any region of interest are performed. Later, a back propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm is used to detect the pattern of urban growth and provides the prediction for future growth. As a case study, we choose an area called Klang Valley (the place of most rapid urban growth) in Malaysia (a country in South East of Asia). With six imagery data set of a same location (for 15 years duration), we model the urban growth by focusing on the pixel based approach. In this way, future urban growth can be predicted based on the past history. In addition, it is possible to focus on certain region of interest in the digital map for any particular urban influential factor. Thus, urban monitoring can be carried out to help the ecological system as well as producing systematic planning for future living.

AB  - Abstract.  This article uses the results from formal network analysis to test hypotheses about the character of Russia's post-communist transition, taking decision-making elites at the sub-national level as the unit of analysis. From the transition literature, the hypothesis generated is that city politics retains elements of its pre-democratic structure; from the urban regime theory, the hypothesis generated is that the elites’ structure will show elements of convergence to a Western type, with the prominence of actors from the private sector. The data is drawn from a survey of elites in one city, Novosibirsk, undertaken in 1997. The results show that the membership and structure of the network has some similar characteristics to a Western city. Rather than being purely dominated by bureaucratic elites, the private sector plays a role. The private sector actors are grouped with the public sector actors, though they are not, however, equal partners to the networks as its members do not appear among the most networked in the city. We conclude that the legacy of the past may not be as much a constraint as the transition literature supposes.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the authors proposed that three components of urban land consumption be recognized in measuring urban land consumption: direct; indirect visible; and indirect less visible urban land uses. The indirect less visible uses are those that are present because of a nearby urban center, but which are not directly identifiable as urban, i.e., they are often difficult to distinguish visually from rural land uses. The indirect less visible component is comprises of two land use categories: the first is land used by exurbanites; the other is termed 'transitional land.' The latter category includes land that has not been built upon but which has started through the processes associated with urban development. This article describes a method for estimating the amount of land in the transitional category and applies the method in two study ares.

Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land area.s. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

Implementation in a high-level language with well-defined and safe semantics could be a good solution to this issue. In this paper, Petri nets have been used to model systems. By defining rules to map Petri net to Haskell, a functional language, we get a high level implementation of the system. After executing Haskell program, we can check in the early design phase the problems that will be found in the late implementation phase.

AB  - This paper formulates a random-growth urban model with a notion of geographical fitness. Using techniques of complex-network theory, we study our system as a type of preferential-attachment model with fitness, and we analyze its macro behavior to clarify the properties of the city-size distributions it predicts. First, restricting the geographical fitness to take positive values and using a continuum approach, we show that the city-size distributions predicted by our model asymptotically approach Pareto distributions with coefficients greater than unity. Then, allowing the geographical fitness to take negative values, we perform local coefficient analysis to show that the predicted city-size distributions can deviate from Pareto distributions, as is often observed in actual city-size distributions. As a result, the model we propose can generate a generic class of city-size distributions, including but not limited to Pareto distributions. For applications to city-population projections, our simple model requires randomness only when new cities are created, not during their subsequent growth. This property leads to smooth trajectories of city population growth, in contrast to other models using Gibrat's law. In addition, a discrete form of our dynamical equations can be used to estimate past city populations based on present-day data; this fact allows quantitative assessment of the performance of our model. Further study is needed to determine appropriate formulas for the geographical fitness. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In all scenarios, urban growth arises from the increase in population particularly, due to tourism and economic change. However, the spatial patterns are different due to alternative assumptions about urban development processes/purposes. The results of modelling are successfully illustrated in a spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for year 2020.

Two models, one to assess the wildland fire hazard and the other to assess the urban/residential fire hazard, are integrated and embedded within the GIS to map regional and neighbourhood risk. The models generate a hazard assessment map comprised of polygons which represent the results of quantitative multivariate analysis. The system allows for future adjustment of one or all of the parameters as policy is implemented and hazardous conditions are mitigated. This features provides a mechanism for accounting and feedback allowing for the appraisal of the success of mitigation.

AB  - Urban areas can contain rich flora that contribute significantly to biodiversity, but loss and isolation of habitats due to urban sprawl threaten biodiversity and warrant limits on development. The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

As part of this effort, we developed a new version of the SLEUTH model (SLEUTH-3r), which introduces new functionality and fit metrics that substantially increase the performance and applicability of the model. In addition, we developed methods that expand the capability of SLEUTH to incorporate economic, cultural and policy information, opening up new avenues for the integration of SLEUTH with other land-change models. SLEUTH-3r is also more computationally efficient (by a factor of 5) and uses less memory (reduced 65%) than the original software. With the new version of SLEUTH, we were able to achieve high accuracies at both the aggregate level of 15 sub-regional modeling units and at finer scales. We present forecasts to 2030 of urban development under a current trends scenario across the entire Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, and three alternative scenarios for a sub-region within the Chesapeake Bay watershed to illustrate the new ability of SLEUTH-3r to generate forecasts across a broad range of conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We present a method for interactive procedural generation of parcels within the urban modeling pipeline. Our approach performs a partitioning of the interior of city blocks using user-specified subdivision attributes and style parameters. Moreover, our method is both robust and persistent in the sense of being able to map individual parcels from before an edit operation to after an edit operation - this enables transferring most, if not all, cus- tomizations despite small to large-scale interactive editing operations. The guidelines guarantee that the resulting subdivisions are functionally and geometrically plausible for subsequent building modeling and construction. Our results include visual and statistical comparisons that demonstrate how the parcel configurations created by our method can closely resemble those found in real-world cities of a large variety of styles. By directly addressing the block subdivision problem, we intend to increase the editability and realism of the urban modeling pipeline and to become a standard in parcel generation for future urban modeling methods.

AB  - A geographic information system (GIS) was a useful aid in the assessment of urban nonpoint source pollution and the development of a pollution control strategy. The GIS was used for data integration and display, and to provide data for a nonpoint source model. An empirical nonpoint source loading model driven by land use was used to estimate pollutant loadings of priority pollutants. Pollutant loadings were estimated at fine spatial resolution adn aggregated to storm sewer drainage basins (sewersheds). Eleven sewersheds were generated from digital versions of sewer maps. The pollutant loadings of individual land use polygons, derived as the units of analysis from street blocks, were aggregated to get total polutant loadings within each sewershed. Based on the model output, a critical sewershed was located. Pollutant loadings at major sewer junctions within the critical sewershed were extimated to develop a mitigation strategy. Two approaches based on the installation of wet ponds were investigated -- a regional approach using one large wet pond at the major sewer outfall and a multisite approach using a number of smaller sites for each major sewer junction. Cost analyses showed that the regional approach would be more cost effective, though it would provide less pollution control.

AB  - In the global context, the population of cities and urbanized areas has developed from a minority to become the majority. Now cities are the largest, most complex and most dynamic man-made systems. They are vibrant centres of cultural life and engines that drive local and global economies. Yet, contemporary urbanized areas are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable entities laying increasing pressure on the surrounding rural areas. Traditional methods of planning and managing large cities that lead to this situation have reached their limits. The planning and design processes therefore need a radical re-thinking. On the computational side, this necessitates the integration of new methods and instruments. On the planning and design side, this requires the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers much earlier than normally done in the past. The combination of interactive design and computation will demonstrate the effects and side effects of urban-rural planning or re-development. We build our design research approach on dynamics and scale: viewing cities and settlements as entities with dynamic urban metabolisms, we propose to apply stocks and flows simulations to the building scale (small, S-Scale), to the urban scale (medium, M-Scale), and to the territorial scale (large, L-Scale). Our long-term goal is the sustainable urban-rural system. Planning and implementation examples from Switzerland and ETH Zurich Science City serve as test cases, with the intent to use the findings for developments in other parts of the world.

AB  - Environmental quality is an abstract concept resulting from both human and natural factors operating at different spatial scales. In urban areas the local scale is dominated by individual buildings, streets and trees, but regional scale influences may include the whole city and beyond. This paper demonstrates the ability of current satellite-based sensing systems to depict parameters of urban environmental quality over large areas at detailed level, using 3D Virtual Reality models. A method is described for increasing the spatial detail and spectral accuracy of Landsat FTM+ thermal data, by fusion with an IKONOS image representing vegetation. Additionally, by depicting the complete radiating surface involved in energy exchange between the surface and atmosphere, including vertical walls, as well as the horizontal surfaces 'seen' by the satellite, a more accurate representation of the urban thermal environment is obtained. The models permit 3D visualization and fly-through animation to represent urban environmental quality, based on quantifiable image parameters, and assist the understanding of the complex and dynamic factors controlling urban environmental quality.

AB  - Different processes shaping land?use patterns are observed at different scales. In land?use modelling, scale can influence the measurement and quantitative description of land?use patterns and can therefore significantly impact the behaviour of model parameters that describe land?use change processes. We present results of a rigorous sensitivity analysis of a cellular urban land?use?change model, SLEUTH, testing its performance in response to varying cell resolutions. Specifically, we examine the behaviour of each type of urban growth rule across different cell sizes, and explore the model's ability to capture growth rates and patterns across scales. Our findings suggest that SLEUTH's sensitivity to scale extend beyond issues of calibration. While the model was able to capture the rate of growth reliably across all cell sizes, differences in its ability to simulate growth patterns across scales were substantial. We also observed significant differences in the sensitivity of the growth rules across cell sizes, indicating that SLEUTH may perform better at certain cell sizes than at others. These findings emphasize the importance of scale considerations in land?use?change modelling research, particularly in terms of determining the relevant and appropriate scales of enquiry for the processes being simulated. Different processes shaping land?use patterns are observed at different scales. In land?use modelling, scale can influence the measurement and quantitative description of land?use patterns and can therefore significantly impact the behaviour of model parameters that describe land?use change processes. We present results of a rigorous sensitivity analysis of a cellular urban land?use?change model, SLEUTH, testing its performance in response to varying cell resolutions. Specifically, we examine the behaviour of each type of urban growth rule across different cell sizes, and explore the model's ability to capture growth rates and patterns across scales. Our findings suggest that SLEUTH's sensitivity to scale extend beyond issues of calibration.

AB  - Recent approaches to modeling urban growth use the notion that urban development can be conceived as a self-organizing system in which natural constraints and institutional controls (land-use policies) temper the way in which local decision-making processes produce macroscopic patterns of urban form. In this paper a cellular automata (CA) model that simulates local decision-making processes associated with fine-scale urban form is developed and used to explore the notion of urban systems as self-organizing phenomenon. The CA model is integrated with a stochastic constraint model that incorporates broad-scale factors that modify or constrain urban growth. Local neighborhood access rules are applied within a broader neighborhood in which friction-of-distance limitations and constraints associated with socio-economic and bio-physical variables are stochastically realized. The model provides a means for simulating the different land-use scenarios that may result from alternative land-use policies. Application results are presented for possible growth scenarios in a rapidly urbanizing region in south east Queensland, Australia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of the current study was the gradual development of the formation of the nitride layer during inductive r.f. plasma nitriding. The study centers on characterization of refined layers and plasma diagnostics in the vicinity of the sample, and raises critical questions of how the layers and interfacial microstructure might affect the near-surface properties. The composition of the plasma near the surface of the sample (plasma layer) was examined by optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry during plasma nitriding and while sputtering the sample after the nitriding process. It was observed that during the nitriding process, the plasma layer contains Ti, NHn species, N (or/and N+), Hn species (or/and H+2). However, when the nitrided sample was exposed to argon plasma, Ti, Al and NH were observed. It was found that two distinct sublayers, comprising &delta;-TiN and &delta;-TiN+&epsilon;-Ti2N phases, were formed with alloying elements in a segregated zone, followed by a solid solution of nitrogen in titanium. The formation of the uppermost sublayer (&delta;-TiN phase), containing H, NH, and N, in addition to Ti depleted of Al and V, has a strong effect on the diffusion of nitrogen into &alpha;-Ti and on the layer properties. This can be enhanced if hydrogen is present in the nitriding atmosphere and is prevented if hydrogen is replaced by argon. Therefore, the nitrogen content in the layer results in the formation of nitride phases and is accompanied by an improvement in mechanical properties.

AB  - We present empirical evidence that land values are scale free and introduce a network model that reproduces the observations. The network approach to urban modeling is based on the assumption that the market dynamics that generates land values can be represented as a growing scale-free network. Our results suggest that the network properties of trade between specialized activities cause land values, and likely also other observables such as population, to be power-law distributed. In addition to being an attractive avenue for further analytical inquiry, the network representation is also applicable to empirical data and is thereby attractive for predictive modeling.

AB  - Conventionally, land use and transport interaction is studied through computer simulation using large-scale integrated land use and transport models. Though comprehensive, most of these models fail to recognise that urban growth is not entirely a global but also a local process. The over-complex and data hungry nature of these models further render them inefficient as tools for strategic planning. This study attempts to find an alternative modelling approach by developing a land use simulation model using cellular automation (CA). The essence of CA is that simple local actions lead to complex global behavioural patterns. The whole system behaves as a self-organising, self-evolving entity based on some transition rules. The model rests on a conceptual framework in which urban land use and transport interaction is characterised as an outcome of aggregate supply and demand. The framework condenses the myriad factors affecting land use and transport into a few attributes which include accessibility, residential density, property value, and passenger trip volume. Recognising that urban growth is both a local and a global process, the CA model developed in this study identifies two effects on land use changes: the attribute effect and the gravity effect. The former is considered as a local driving force for change constituted by changing accessibility and other attributes resulting from the interaction of land use and transport at the neighbourhood level. The latter is a universal resistance to change due to inertia and agglomeration of compatible land uses in the vicinity. The combination of these two forces determines local land use changes. Taken together, these local changes constitute the global land use pattern. Practical use of the CA model will be demonstrated using metropolitan Melbourne as a study area.

AB  - KEY WORDS: surface temperature, anisotropy, urban climate, sensor-view model Thermal remote sensing of urban areas is affected by directional variations (anisotropy) of the upwelling thermal radiation. The anisotropy arises due to the three-dimensionally rough urban surface that creates microscale patterns of surface temperature variability associated with surface position, orientation and composition, coupled with a biased view of this rough surface by the remote sensor. The large magnitudes of observed urban thermal anisotropy suggest it can be a significant factor in the interpretation of urban surface characteristics such as the surface urban heat island and application of urban surface temperatures to modelling urban surface heat fluxes. Here we couple the SUM urban surface sensor view model (Soux et al. 2004) with the urban canopy energy balance model of Mills (1997) and a newly developed three-dimensional energy balance model to investigate the variability of thermal anisotropy with surface geometric parameters. Relatively large anisotropy is modelled for realistic urban H/W ratios, and realistic plan area ratios generate a 30% variability of the thermal anisotropy over urban surfaces. Coupled simulations with both energy balance models yielded similar results for anisotropy in the case study examined. The simulations substantially under-estimated the anisotropy compared to observations from a helicopter-mounted thermal scanner despite showing good agreement between modelled and observed temperature differences between major urban surface facets. This suggests the simplified urban surface geometry used by the models is inadequate to replicate the observed anisotropy.

AB  - Owing to the urban logistics system was an uncertain, nonlinear, dynamic and complicated system, and it was difficult to describe it by traditional methods, a modeling and forecasting method of urban logistics demand based on improved simulated annealing neural network (ISANN) is presented in this paper. First the simulated annealing algorithm with the best reserve mechanism is introduced and it is organic combined with Powell algorithm to form improved simulated annealing mixed optimize algorithm, instead of gradient falling algorithm of BP network to train network weight. It can get higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. We construct the network structure, and give the algorithm flow. The main parameters of affecting urban logistics demand are studied. With the ability of strong self-learning and faster convergence of ISANN, the modeling and forecasting method can truly forecast the logistics demand. The actual forecasting results show that this method is feasible and effective.

AB  - An increasing number of models for predicting land use change in rapidly urbanizing regions are being proposed and built using ideas from cellular automata (CA). Calibrating such models to real situations is highly problematic and to date, serious attention has not been focused on the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a structure for simulating urban change based on estimating land use transitions using elementary probabilistic methods which draw their inspiration from Bayes' theory and the related 'weights of evidence' approach. These land use change probabilities drive a CA model based on eight cell Moore neighborhoods implemented through empirical land use allocation algorithms. The model framework has been applied to a medium-sized town, Bauru, in the west of São Paulo State, Brazil. We show how various socio-economic and infrastructural factors can be combined using the weights of evidence approach which enables us to predict the probability of changes between land use types in different cells of the system. Different predictions for the town during the period 1979-1988 were generated, and statistical validation was then conducted using a multiple resolution fitting procedure. These modeling experiments support the essential logic of adopting Bayesian empirical methods which synthesize various information about spatial infrastructure as the driver of urban land use change. This indicates the relevance of the approach for generating forecasts of growth for Brazilian cities in particular and for world-wide cities in general. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban land-use allocation in areas of transition (ecotones) is a complex task due to tensions between the need to develop residential and industrial areas and the wish to preserve high biodiversity and heterogeneous landscapes. This controversy is especially enhanced in a small and dense country like Israel, where efforts to achieve sustainable development are faced with difficulties typical of sensitive ecological regions and rapid population growth. This study incorporates the use of a multi-criteria mechanism in a GIS for the evaluation of the suitability of ecologically sensitive areas for four possible land-uses: nature reserves; forest plantations; residential areas; and industrial areas. The evaluation procedure pronounces the effect of: existing land-uses; soil characteristics; topographic attributes; vegetation cover; and landscape heterogeneity (as expressed by the Habitat Heterogeneity Model (HHM) that was developed within the frame of this study). The study area is the surroundings of a city that was established 30 years ago and is located in a transition zone between Mediterranean climate and the desert. The evaluation method used here provides a suitability layer for each of the four land-uses and a final layer that could recommend the most suitable land-use for each cell. The outcome of the system developed can be used as a basis for planners and decision makers dealing with the development of cities and their surroundings in regions of high ecological and environmental sensitivity. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article provides a critical review of the history of urban modeling in North America, with a focus on unraveling some fundamental issues that militated against incorporating the first-generation urban models into planning practice. After examining the underlying theoretical context in social practice, I demonstrate that the re-emergence of a different form of rationality creates the conditions for incorporating new forms of urban models. Finally, I highlight the developments in group decision support systems research and suggest how these systems, together with a geographic information systems component, can be designed for critical planning practice.
