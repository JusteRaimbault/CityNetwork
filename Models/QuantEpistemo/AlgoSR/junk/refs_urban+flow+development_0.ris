AB  - The author questions the longevity of the UDCs by talking about a new policy culture for the 1990s, one in which the UDCs are "out' and partnerships are "in'. In particular he highlights the references by UDCs to "community involvement' and even the LDDC are providing a community line in recognizing the "lasting regeneration will only be achieved by improving the quality of life for everyone who lives and works in Docklands'. He argues that it remains akin to American-style growth coalitions, bringing together partnerships which solely comprise development elites. In this sense, he is pessimistic about the future of local authority involvement in urban regeneration, predicting their retention of a facilitative role but with little or no control over the regeneration process. -from Editors

AB  - The flow development in the model human aorta with uniform entry as well as with centrally occluding valves mounted at the root of the aorta was described in Part I of this two-paper sequence. Part II deals with the flow development in the model aorta with tilting disc valves mounted at the root of the aorta. Bjork-Shiley and Hall-Kaster tilting disc valves were mounted in three different orientations with respect to the root of the aorta. The velocity profiles and turbulent stresses were measured with laser-Doppler anemometry. Our results under steady flow conditions in the model human aorta show quantitatively that the flow development in the ascending aorta as well as in the brachio-cephalic artery are strongly dependent on the orientation of the tilting disc valves. With the valves tilting towards the outer wall of curvature, our results suggest a tendency for flow separation at the flow divider region of the brachio-cephalic artery.

AB  - This paper introduces an asset-focused framework whose objective is both analytically to better understand, and operationally to more appropriately address, the different phases of urban climate change (CC) as it impacts on poor urban communities. After an overview of current CC adaptation approaches, it describes the two asset adaptation framework components; first, an asset vulnerability analytical framework that appraises the vulnerability groups most affected by CC-related disasters, and second, an asset adaptation operational framework that identifies CC strategies at individual, household and community level in four phases of long-term resilience; pre-disaster damage limitation; immediate post-disaster response; and rebuilding. It concludes by describing its associated methodology. The paper aims to assist CC researchers and those supporting the poor protect and rebuild assets during CC-related disaster processes.

AB  - The mean-flow structure of supersonic, turbulent, adiabatic-wall flow in a square duct is investigated experi- mentally over a development length of 50 duct widths for a uniform flow, Mach 3.9 condition at the duct inlet. The results show that a secondary flow cell structure develops that is similar to that for the incompressible case. This secondary flow distorts the primary flow, whose behavior also is influenced by shear-layer interaction ef- fects as the wall boundary layers merge. Axial mean-velocity profiles plotted in terms of van Driest-scaled varia- bles show that a well-defined log-law region exists in the near-wall layer. This region exists in the presence of a secondary flow that continuously modifies spanwise wall shear stress behavior along the length of the duct.

AB  - The link between edge sheared flows and turbulence is investigated in the plasma edge region of the TJ-II stellarator and the results are compared with results in other devices like JET tokamak. In the TJ-II stellarator there is a threshold density to trigger the development of edge shear flows. During sheared flow development the degree of turbulence anisotropy (<(upsilon) over tilde (parallel to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)>) is modified. The fact that different quadratic terms in fluctuating velocities (<(upsilon) over tilde (parallel to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)> and <(upsilon) over tilde (perpendicular to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)>) change during edge sheared flow generation means that shear flow physics involves 3D physics phenomena in which both perpendicular and parallel dynamics are involved. A new strategy has been recently applied to plasma physics to quantify the local energy transfer between flows and turbulence by computing the production term. Experimental results show that turbulence can act as an energy sink and energy source for the mean flow near the shear layer. Measurements of the turbulence production show the importance of 3D effects on the energy transfer between flows and turbulence

AB  - The urban proportion of China's population is forecast to increase from 30.2% (319 million) in 1995 to 49.1% (711.7 million) in 2020. During the same period car ownership in cities is forecast to increase by 1,000%, i.e. ten times more. Urban traffic congestion is becoming rapidly worse. It is already a major constraint on urban productivity and sustainability and it is impeding improvement in the quality of life. Most urbanised cities have experienced serious traffic congestion. In some large cities, the duration of congestion, the size of congested areas and their number are on the rise. Vehicular air and noise pollution is increasing, contributing significantly to greenhouse gases (GHG) and global warming and posing a serious health threat to urban populations. Urban transport energy consumption has been growing steadily. Shares of traditional NMT (non motorised transport) modes, especially bicycle transport, are decreasing in response to both longer travel distances (brought about by an unprecedented urbanisation and urban sprawl pattern) and problems inherent in sharing road space with more cars. Much of the erstwhile NMT traffic is presently shifting to public transport modes, predominantly the bus. However, public transport services are poor in many cities. The development of public transport is often hindered by a lack of capacity, slow operating speeds, outdated equipment and outdated management practices. Urban commuters have been experiencing longer traveling times by using the bus. Â© 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper describes the continuation of an investigation into the effects of increased flow on the dissolved oxygen concentration in the River Maun, UK. A previous investigation indicated that an oxygen demand additional to that in the water phase is observed during and directly after intermittent discharges. Simplified modelling of the river indicated that the additional oxygen demand was possibly linked to the disturbance of sediment during such events. A device has been developed which can be used in situ to measure the effect of flow velocity (shear stress) on the additional demand. Preliminary tests have shown that the inferred demand is significant. It is proposed that the in situ device now be used to measure the oxygen demand of the bed material at a number of locations and flow speeds and that a relationship between the additional demand and velocity be established, with the aim of incorporating such a relationship into a simplified model.

We describe here the build-up of an experimental set-up designed to investigate the critical coalescence conditions in the case of two free water droplets in an oil shear flow under the action of an applied electric field. Drop pairs will be injected in a Poiseuille flow to study, by optical means, their relative motion, deformation and possible coalescence. Important part of this preliminary work concerns the injection of controlled charge free drop pairs using a newly developed EHD actuation technique.

AB  - Urban flow is a phenomenon of the interaction and relation between the\ncities in the region based on the transport network and urban synthetic\nstrength. And, because of the difference in traffic conditions and the\nlevel of economic development in different city, the intensity of the\nurban flow of each city is different and the primary effecting factor is\ndissimilar. The traditional analysis on the effecting factors of urban\nflow concerns the background of the entire region as a whole entity,\nwhich would be too vague and ignore the difference in the effecting\nfactors of different cities as well as the micro differences and spatial\nnon-stationarity in the dominant factor. The research on spatial\ndifference in the effecting factors of the urban flow in this paper\nfocused on the analysis of the diverse effecting factors of urban now\ncaused by the regional disparity; found out the primary factors; and\nanalyzed the spatial characteristics of effecting factors using GIS.

AB  - The airflow and dispersion of a pollutant in a complex urban area of Beijing, China, were numerically examined by coupling a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model with a mesoscale weather model. The models used were Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software package and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. OpenFOAM was firstly validated against wind-tunnel experiment data. Then, the WRF model was integrated for 42 h starting from 0800 LST 08 September 2009, and the coupled model was used to compute the flow fields at 1000 LST and 1400 LST 09 September 2009. During the WRF-simulated period, a high pressure system was dominant over the Beijing area. The WRF-simulated local circulations were characterized by mountain valley winds, which matched well with observations. Results from the coupled model simulation demonstrated that the airflows around actual buildings were quite different from the ambient wind on the boundary provided by the WRF model, and the pollutant dispersion pattern was complicated under the influence of buildings. A higher concentration level of the pollutant near the surface was found in both the step-down and step-up notches, but the reason for this higher level in each configurations was different: in the former, it was caused by weaker vertical flow, while in the latter it was caused by a downward-shifted vortex. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the coupled WRF-OpenFOAM model is an important tool that can be used for studying and predicting urban flow and dispersions in densely built-up areas.

AB  - The development of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity downstream of a standard tube bundle and three different slotted plates has been measured in a four inch pipe using a 1-D laser Doppler anemometer system. The results show how far the standard tube bundle must be placed upstream of the orifice plate to obtain fully developed mean velocity and turbulence. Numerical analyses of how shaping the velocity profile exiting a flow conditioner effects the development of both the turbulence and mean velocity have been performed. These analyses indicate that a power law profile (1/7th) with a 9% turbulence intensity produces a fully developed flow in the shortest pipe length, 20 D. A parabolic profile requires a slightly longer development length. A uniform flow required the longest length of pipe. The effect of the turbulence intensity produced by the flow conditioner was also investigated. Three different slotted plates were manufactured to produce a 1/7th power law, parabolic, and uniform velocity profile downstream of the plate. The development of the mean velocity and turbulence have been measured. These data were compared to the predictions with very favorable results. The simulations accurately represented the flow field and turbulence intensity distibutions.

AB  - Landslides are one of the most important processes supplying debris flow materials into channels. We need to predict the timing, location, and volume of landslides for better estimation of the occurrence of debris flows. However, a number of soil parameters (e.g., the angle of internal friction, cohesion, and porosity), which have significant spatial variability, are needed to predict landslide occurrence. Therefore, it is important to make clear the contribution of these parameters to overall slope stability and their relationships to one another. In this study, we normalized the safety factor equation for infinite slope model, and introduced multi soil layer structure into the model. We also tried to clarify factors affecting the pore water pressure on the basis of the equations for the vertical infiltration process (i.e., continuity equation and Darcy's law). Depth gradient of the pore-water pressure at the given soil layer is controlled by the ratio of the water velocity in saturated zone to the hydraulic conductivity at that layer. New, non-dimensional representations for the effects of groundwater table and cohesion of soil were obtained by the normalization of the safety factor equation. They are evaluated relative to each other by comparison to the stability of dry non-cohesive soil. The effect of the groundwater table and the cohesion of soil on the slope stability are both affected by depth of the sliding surface. We also found that the effect of cohesion should be evaluated from the comparison with the maximum effect of groundwater table to the stability. This can explain the immunity of post-landslide slopes to immediately subsequent landslides, as well as the cyclical nature of landslide processes. Â© 2011 Casa Editrice UniversitÃ  La Sapienza.

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics modelling of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is commonly simplified to consider a two-dimensional axisymmetric problem. To determine the validity of this assumption, a Floquet stability analysis was employed to predict the conditions under which an axisymmetric aneurysmal flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric instabilities. Dimensions of the model were selected to be consistent with a high-risk aneurysm in the human abdominal aorta. In particular, the model consisted of an elliptical bulge defining the aneurysm, and both upstream and downstream artery sections. A sinusoidal time-varying parabolic velocity profile was input upstream, with Womersley number Î± = 16.9 (representing a heart rate of 70 beats per minute when artery diameter D = 22.7 mm and kinematic viscosity v = 3.3x10 -6 m 2 s). A Reynolds number range relevant to aneurysms in large arteries was examined, with the critical Reynolds number for non-axisymmetric transition and the corresponding azimuthal wavelength found to be Re CRIT = 610 and Î» = Ï (azimuthal mode number m = 2). The maximum vorticity at the vessel wall was found to occur at the distal end of the aneurysm bulge. The pulsatile flow frequency was also varied, with the frequency dependence on Re CRIT and Î» being established.

AB  - Numerical simulations were conducted to model the transient flow development in a naturally ventilated space containing a centrally located localized source of heat. The simulations were compared with a series of small-scale laboratory experiments and existing theoretical models. The aim of the work was to benchmark CFD models for time-dependent buoyancy-driven natural ventilation against previously published experimental results and theoretical models. The simulations agree well with experimental\nresults during the initial development of the room stratification. The CFD results accurately predict the\nmaximum depth of the hot buoyant layer at the top of the room as well as the steady-state interface height which separates the warm upper buoyant layer from the cooler air below. The simulations also predict well the time taken for the buoyant upper layer to reach its maximum depth. However, at longer times the results diverge. This may be due to thermal diffusion and mixing at the interface between the upper and lower layers due to the inflow from the floor level vents.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental investigation of a scaled down model of a PGT10 gas turbine diffuser by Nuovo Pignone S.p.A. The model was designed to operate in geometric and Reynolds number similarity with the GT diffuser, and 24 guide vanes are mounted at inlet to reproduce typical inlet conditions of an industrial gas turbine diffuser. The PGT10 diffuser has also six high-solidity struts, which support one of the shaft bearings and have lubricating oil supply inside. Two step-motors are used for the circumferential and radial displacement of the probes. Airflow through the test model is provided by an open circuit wind tunnel, which is powered by a 21 kW centrifugal fan. Two hot split-film probes in constant temperature mode were used to measure velocity fluctuations in main-flow, cross-flow and radial-flow directions, thus allowing a 3D characterization of the model's flow field. Results are presented in terms of mean and fluctuating velocity components at different axial positions. The discussion is focused on the distortion of the flow produced by the struts and on the separation around the hub and the shell. A first set of measurement defines the flow field from the inlet to the exhaust at four axial sections. In three additional axial positions, behind the struts, a more detailed analysis has been made with measuring grid with a double number of nodes. The investigation of the flow field inside the diffuser is also presented by means of the turbulent scale of dissipating eddies, calculated with the Kolmogorov theory. The Kolmogorov length scale seems to be a powerful means to study fluid dynamic phenomena. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, laser-Doppler anemometry measurement of steady flow development in a model human aorta has been reported. Studies were made with uniform entry flow at the root of the aorta and our measurements showed the establishment of a pair of Dean vortices in the mid-arch region. Subsequently, the nature of flow development past centrally occluding caged ball valves in the model aorta was investigated. Our studies showed that in the ascending aorta, an asymmetric velocity profile is obtained with larger velocity gradients towards the inner wall of tertiary curvature (anatomically the left lateral wall) with centrally occluding valves. The peripheral flow past these valves prevented the development of Dean vortices in the mid-arch region. The caged ball valves at the root of the aorta had no discernible effect on the velocity profiles in the brachio-cephalic artery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The umbilical vein is the major source of blood for the fetal liver, but portal blood, which has not been measured directly in human fetuses, probably constitutes a physiologically important contribution. We aimed to establish a method for measuring blood flow in the fetal portal vein and to produce longitudinal reference ranges for diameter, blood flow velocities and volume blood flow during the second half of pregnancy. METHODS: After a pilot project to develop the measuring technique, 160 low-risk pregnant women were recruited to a longitudinal study that included ultrasound examinations at 4-5-week intervals starting at 20-22 weeks of gestation. The inner diameter (D) of the vessel was measured with a perpendicular insonation angle, and the time-averaged maximum blood velocity (TAMXV) and weighted mean velocity (VWMEAN) were recorded with an insonation directed along the long axis of the vessel. Portal flow was calculated as: Q = pi(D/2)(2) x h x TAMXV (where h is a velocity profile parameter and equals 0.5). Portal flow was normalized for estimated fetal weight based on birth-weight percentiles. RESULTS: The portal vein could be visualized and measured in 558/593 (94%) cases. Blood flow was pulsatile. D and TAMXV doubled during the second half of pregnancy (21-39 weeks), from 1.5 to 3.4 mm and from 8.4 to 14.9 cm/s, respectively. Correspondingly, the portal flow increased from 5 to 41 mL/min, and from 10 to 13 mL/min/kg when normalized for fetal weight. Similar results were achieved for VWMEAN. CONCLUSION: Portal flow can be measured with a standardized technique. It increases during the second half of pregnancy, even when normalized for fetal weight, suggesting that it has increasing importance in the fetal liver circulation.

AB  - In accordance with the material flow theory put forward by the authors, this paper divides the nature of material flow into inherent nature and non-inherent nature. The quantitative and qualitative changes of the non-inherent nature of material flow determine the development states of material flow, which mainly manifest three states, namely, traditional material flow, modern material flow and transform of the traditional material flow to modern material flow. To further reveal the change rule of material flow development states, this paper takes establishment of three-dimensional structure model of material flow state as the theoretic foundation, express it with the ordered triple M <sub>F</sub>=SMTE, C, V(t). It reflects the material flow state changes with non-inherent nature SMTE about V(t) of C.

We then examine the effect that the UDCs have had on urban policy development during the 1980s and the 1990s, what trends they have initiated or intensified and what pressures they have responded to. In the third section we are concerned with the perspectives on the UDCs, the way in which the UDC story is now being told. Examines the continuity and discontinuities that prevail in current urban policy. Questions how the role of UDCs has changed, particularly in the light of City Challenge as the new flagship. Finishes by analysing the extent to which City Challenge and the Urban Regeneration Agency in particular as well as other policy vehicles are capable of meeting the enduring problems of urban policy. -from Authors

AB  - Olefin metathesis has emerged as a unique and powerful transformation for the intercoversion of olefinic compds., ultimately due to the development of well-defined catalyst systems.  The ruthenium alkylidene complexes developed at Caltech by Professor Grubbs and co-workers have further facilitated the advancement of this technol. owing to the increased tolerance towards org. functionality, moisture and oxygen.  Even with all the noteworthy progress in this area, there are still important avenues to be pursued, of which, the development of an efficient heterogeneous catalyst system ranks high on the list.  A heterogeneous catalyst system will offer a no. of benefits such as catalyst recovery and reuse, along with generating products free of Ru contamination.  Our efforts towards realizing this goal will be described, with an emphasis on the synthesis of the heterogeneous catalysts and the various screening protocols employed to evaluate the new catalytic systems.

AB  - An experimental study of the initial flow field downstream of a step change in surface roughness is presented. The roughness length of the downstream surface was approximately tenfold that of the upstream roughness and, unlike all previous studies, attention was concentrated on the roughness sublayer region beneath the inertial (log-law) region. The experiments were conducted at a boundary layer Reynolds number of about 6 x 10(4) (based on layer thickness and free-stream velocity) and around a longitudinal location where the (downstream) roughness length, z(o2),was about 1% of the boundary-layer thickness at the roughness change point. The thickness of the roughness sublayer was found for the two roughness. It was observed that the vertical profiles of mean velocity and turbulence characteristics started to show similarity after about 160(z02) downstream of the roughness change. The presence of a shear stress overshoot is shown to depend strongly on the precise location (with respect to the roughness elements) at which the measurements are made and the thickness of the equilibrium layer is shown to be very sensitive to the way it is defined. It is demonstrated that the growing equilibrium layer has first to encompass the roughness sublayer before any thickness of inertial sublayer can be developed. It follows that, in some practical cases, like flows across some urban environments, the latter (log-law) region may never exist at all.

AB  - A Galerkin finite element method is described for studying the stability of two superposed immiscible Newtonian fluids in plane Poiseuille flow. The formulation results in an algebraic eigenvalue problem of the form A L^2 + B L+ C = 0 which, after transforming to a standard generalized eigenvalue problem, is solved by the QR algorithm. The numerical results are in good agreement with previous asymptotic results. Additional results show that the finite element method is ideally suited for studying linear stability of superposed fluids when parameters characterizing the flow fall outside the range amenable to perturbation methods. The applicability of the finite element method to similar eigenvalue problems is demonstrated by analysing the steady-state spatial development of two superposed fluids in a channel.

AB  - An international comparative study of the relations among the process of urbanization, urban concentration and economic development, and income distribution was performed by using data of developing and developed countries. Cross-section analyses at certain time periods for capturing "long-run" effects as well as time-series analyses for some countries for "short-run" effects were done taking advantage of the "rectangular" array of data. There were several interesting results: the pattern of unemployment rate in most developing countries shows an inverted-U shaped curve with respect to the degree of urbanization; the pattern of urban concentration is in the form of an inverted-U with respect to the economic development level; and the degree of inequality of income distribution seems to react in an inverted-U form to the variances in the extent of urbanization.

AB  - The near-field region of a coaxial jet having inner to outer diameter ratio di /do 0.39 is investigated experimentally for four ratios of annular to central jet velocities of   0.18, 0.48, 0.8, and 1.11. Measurements were acquired nonintrusively using molecular tagging velocimetry at downstream distances up to six inner jet diameters. High spatial-resolution profiles of mean axial velocity, axial turbulent intensity, skewness, kurtosis, radial gradients of mean velocity, and velocity gradient fluctuations are presented and discussed. In the near-exit region of the inner mixing layer, evidence suggests the existence of two trains of vortices shed from the inner jet wall for velocity ratios   0.18. The results also indicate that for the flow configuration examined the length of the annular potential core is a function of the velocity ratio. Turbulence characteristics of the flow appear to be influenced by both the velocity ratio and absolute velocity of the annular jet. Integral length and Taylor microscales in the inner shear layer are shown to grow monotonically with downstream distance, with their ratio reaching a constant value. It is concluded that the turbulence structure in the inner mixing layer is highly anisotropic and that the levels of anisotropy are a relatively strong function of the velocity ratio.

AB  - This paper presents a cohesive study of flowin a jet-driven vortex chamber for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, contraction ratios, inlet angles, areas, and aspect ratios. Dimensional analysis furnishes the general functional relationships between the fundamental dimensionless quantities.Application of the integral equations of continuity and energy over the control volume, along with the minimum-pressure-drop or maximum-flow-rate postulate, provide the required analytical means to relate the predominant nondimensional parameters such as the chamber geometry, core size, pressure drop, Reynolds number, and viscous losses. The theoretical results successfully capture most of the salient properties of the flow. A parametric examination explores how the pressure coefficient and the core size vary with the different dimensionless properties. The observations show the pressure drop to decrease with the length. At first this appears to be counterintuitive since one habitually expects the pressure drop to be larger for longer pipes. A closer consideration, however, reveals that in addition to the radialaxial plane flow there is also a substantial centrifugal force, which decays with the length, thus shaping the development of the overall flowfield. Last, the current theory confirms that the previous published models are only applicable for high Reynolds numbers where the inertia dominates the viscous forces.

AB  - This article presents comparisons between predictions, obtained during the course of this investigation, and recently produced measurements of the flow development through a square cross-sectioned U-bend of strong curvature, Rc/D = 0.65, that is either stationary or in orthogonal rotation. For the stationary case, four turbulence models have been tested; a high-Re k-Îµ model interfaced with the low-Re 1-equation model in the near-wall regions, a high-Re algebraic second-moment (ASM) closure with the low-Re 1-equation model in the near-wall regions, and two versions of a low-Re ASM model. The two low-Re ASM models return noticeably better predictions of the flow development. There is, however further scope for improvement, especially in the downstream section. Two rotating flow cases have been computed both with the axis of rotation parallel to the axis of bend curvature; one at a positive rotation number Ro â¡ Î©D/Wb of 0.2 and one at Ro â¡ -0.2. In the case of positive rotation, where the Coriolis and curvature forces reinforce each other, the flow predictions of the low-Re ASM are in very close agreement with the data. When the U-bend rotates negatively, the complex flow field generated in the downstream section is not well reproduced by the low-Re ASM model. More refined turbulence models are thus necessary when the curvature and Coriolis forces oppose each other.

AB  - This book is a powerful indictment of the current consensus on how to cope with the hundreds of "mega-cities" of the developing world. These cities are the future, and the problems surrounding this influx of people-slums, poverty, unemployment and lack of governance-have been well-documented. Pieterse argues that the current "shelter for all" and "urban good governance" policies treat only the symptoms of the problem. Instead, he claims, there is an urgent need to reinvigorate civil society in these cities, to encourage radical democracy, economic resilience, social resistance and environmental sustainability folded into the everyday concerns of marginalized people.

AB  - Considering the importance of technical networks in the cityâs functioning, we develop a tool to better understand interdependencies between urban systems. The tool is not based on models and flow quantification insofar as managers are not willing to share data and yet lack information concerning the impacts they could withstand in case of disruption. Thus the method is based on practitionersâ knowledge and enables the construction of a common representation of the urban system. We explain with a Parisian case study how it can be used and how the interdependencies identification contributes to the improvement of urban resilience. Indeed, resilience to disturbances requires an integrated management of all systems impacted and helps decision-makers to plan for reducing losses.

AB  - The develoment of the laminar velocity and pressure fields in the hydrodynamic entrance region of rectangular ducts has been explored experimentally. Duct cross sections having aspect ratios of 5:1 and 2:1 were employed in the investigation; air was the working fluid. It was found that the development of the pressure field is much more rapid than that of the velocity field. The entrance length, relative to pressure development, is representable as (z/De)/Re=0.02 for both ducts. The incremental pressure drop due to the development of the flow was deduced from the experimental data as being approximately equal to one velocity head. The axial development of the velocity field is illustrated by a sequence of velocity profiles measured along the symmetry lines of the cross section. The flow development in the 5:1 duct is found to be somewhat more rapid than in the 2:1 duct. Comparisons of the experimental results are made with available predictions of analysis, all of which are based on approximate models of the flow field. In general, the analyses overpredict the incremental pressure drop due to flow development. The development of the velocity field appears to be reasonably well described by analysis.

AB  - Void fraction, Taylor bubble and liquid slug lengths, and slug frequency are parameters essential to any description of the structure of slug flow. In the present study, these parameters were extracted from the time series of cross-sectionally averaged void fraction obtained from two vertical facilities having similar internal pipe diameter but significantly different axial lengths; 51.2 mm/3.5 m and 52.3 mm/9 m. In order to study slug flow, the flow rates for which it occurred were first identified. To investigate the effect of flow development on slug characteristics measurements were carried out at several axial locations from the mixing section for both facilities. For slug frequency, a new correlation including the effect of the axial length has been proposed and assessed using previously published data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The entrance conditions for pulsatile flow are important in the understanding blood flow out of the heart and in developing regions at branches. The pulsatile entrance flow was solved using a spectral element simulation of the full unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. A mean Reynolds number of 200 and a range of Womersley parameters from 1.8 to 12.5 was used for a sinusoidal inlet flow waveform 1 + sin (omega t). Variations in the entrance length were observed during the pulsatile cycle. The amplitude of the entrance length variation decreased with an increase in the Womersley parameter. The phase lag between the entrance length and the inlet flow waveform increased for Womersley parameter alpha up to 5.0 and decreased for alpha larger than 5.0. For low alpha, the maximum entrance length during pulsatile flow was approximately the same as the steady entrance length for the peak flow. For high varies; is directly proportional to, the pulsatile entrance length was more uniform during the cycle and tended to the entrance length for the mean flow. The wall shear rate reached its far downstream value after only about half of the entrance length and also exhibited a dependence on alpha. The results quantify the entrance conditions typically encountered in studies of the arterial system.

AB  - The effect of valve orientation on flow development in a model human aorta was studied by means of a qualitative flow visualization technique. The model replicated the geometry of the human aorta and the experiment simulated a physiologically realistic pulsatile flow. The following valves were studied: Starr-Edwards Stellite, Starr-Edwards silicone, BjÃ¶rk-Shiley spherical disc, BjÃ¶rk-Shiley convexo-concave disc, and Hall-Kaster tilting disc. All the valves had a tissue anulus diameter of 27 mm. With the ball-in-cage valves, the flow in the ascending aorta was predominantly axial and uniform throughout systole, while vortex formation was observed downstream from the ball. With the tilting disc valves, the flow development in the aorta was a function of the orientation of the valves. With the major flow orifice directed toward the commissure between the right and noncoronary cusps, the fluid motion was predominantly in the axial direction through early systole. A vortex developed along the wall of lesser curvature of the aorta with the progression of systole. In early diastole, a well-defined flow reversal was observed along the lesser curvature of the aorta. With the major flow orifice directed toward the left coronary cusp, the fluid motion, although predominantly axial, was not uniform in the ascending aorta. Regions of relative stasis present near the wall of greater curvature subsequently developed into a trapped vortex throughout the cardiac cycle. With the major flow orifice directed more posteriorly, an improved fluid dynamic characteristic was observed, and there was no trapped vortex present near the wall of greater curvature. The flow visualization study in the model human aorta suggests that, from a fluid dynamic point of view, orientation of the major flow orifice of the tilting disc valve toward the wall of lesser curvature is not advisable.

A computational model for transient two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations has been used to study both time and space development of flow due to a sudden pressure rise. Two kinds of boundary conditions are used, the no-slip condition as well as the slip condition encountered in micro-channels both for liquid and gas flows. Compressibility effects are however neglected in order to concentrate on the slip effect.

This kind of flow visualization is important in the field of biofluid mechanics, since a close relationship is assumed between flow and biological phenomena. This new method is non-invasive, and is also applicable for unsteady flows. It has been used to investigate the steady and the unsteady laminar flow in a rectangular duct, as well as the steady, laminar flow in two different U-shaped ducts, both with a backward facing step, one having a rectangular cross-section, the other a nearly elliptical cross-section. The results concurred well with analytical or numerical solutions.

AB  - Poverty dominates the international development agenda of the 21st century. The improvement of the health and living conditions of millions of slum dwellers around the world is a primary concern of the current Millennium Development Goals for reducing poverty. Up to the 1980s poverty was largely associated with the rural areas in developing countries; but the situation has changed with the dramatic increase in the numbers and proportion of the population living in urban areas, and a corresponding increase in the level of urban poverty. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that the proportion of the urban work force engaged in the informal sector is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and accounts for more than 50% of urban employment in two-thirds of the countries surveyed in 1999. Irregular settlements also have become so pervasive that they seem to outnumber legally planned development, and their social legitimacy appears to be no longer in question. Unfortunately, the appalling environmental conditions associated with informal sector activities and settlements constitute a major threat to the health and well-being of urban life.

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of two-dimensional laminar flow in the entrance region of wavy wall ducts as obtained from the solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. Design/methodology/approach-The study is undertaken by application of the generalized integral transform technique in the solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The streamfunction-only formulation is adopted, and a general filtering solution that adapts to the irregular contour is proposed to enhance the convergence behavior of the eigenfunction expansion. Findings-A few representative cases are considered more closely in order to report some numerical results illustrating the eigenfunction expansions convergence behavior. The product friction factor-Reynolds number is also computed and compared against results from discrete methods available in the literature for different Reynolds numbers and amplitudes of the wavy channel. Research limitations/implications-The proposed methodology is fairly general in the analysis of different channel profiles, though the reported results are limited to the wavy channel configuration. Future work should also extend the analysis to geometries represented in the cylindrical coordinates with longitudinally variable radius. Practical implications-The error-controlled converged results provide reliable benchmark results for the validation of numerical results from computational codes that address the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in irregular geometries. Originality/value-Although the hybrid methodology is already known in the literature, the results here presented are original and further challenges application of the integral transform method in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.

AB  - Motivated by the recent experimental observation of noticeable features of dimplelike surface roughness patterns onthe hybrid fuel grain, the authors investigated a coldflowin a porouschamberwith surface massinjection through a large eddy simulation technique. The main purpose is to understand the role of turbulent structures in generating those irregular, isolated roughness patterns found on the fuel surface. Itwas noted that the structural feature of near- wall coherent vortices has been considerably altered by the application of wall injection, resulting in isolated cell-like contours of streamwise velocity distributed all over the horizontal planes close to the wall. This sudden change of contour shape is reminiscent of the roughness patterns observed in the accompanying experiment. The rapid evolution of the kinematical configuration of near-wall turbulence structures is believed to be caused by the effect of vertical momentum given at the wall as in the regression process.

The experiments demonstrated the retardation of the onset of the development of the Marangoni concentration-induced convection relative to the moment of the contact between an inflowing surfactant (alcohol) and the surface. The critical concentration gradients (the Marangoni diffusion numbers) necessary for the initiation of mass transfer of a liquid along the interface were determined as dependent on the rate of inflow of a tongue of a more concentrated solution and the initial alcohol concentration around the bubble.

AB  - Large landslides are often characterised by complex activity resulting from their ability to suddenly change behaviour. In fact, these landslides can pass from a slump to a flow characterised by relatively high mobility. This characteristics is a cause of extremely high severity and hazard in areas affected by such phenomena. An interesting case of a large slide in glacial deposits, which occurred in 1993 in the Valcamonica of the Italian Alps, is presented. Different approaches both to characterise the coarse frictional materials involved in the slide and to model the slide initiation and its evolution are adopted. The initial slide mass had a volume of almost 2 Mm3 and after its initial sliding motion along the slope, flowed for about 7 km down the main valley stream. Voight's method has been used to analyse measured slope displacements recorded for a few years before the slope failure. This analysis provided evidence that different times of failure could have been predicted beforehand by rigorous examination of the available data. Laboratory tests and image/processing techniques have been performed to characterise the landslide material as resembling a "bimrock" (block in matrix material). Slope stability analyses have been performed and a dynamic modelling method has been tested on the flow by comparing its results to those obtained by analysis of eyewitness statements and field observations on the mudline left by the flow. Finally, existing empirical approaches for hazard assessment on an alluvial fan have been applied and modified to produce a hazard zonation map for the alluvial fan area by considering maximum expected discharge, local geometry of the channel and the possibility of channel occlusion and subsequent avulsion. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The nature of supersonic, turbulent, adiabatic-wall flow in a square duct is investigated experimentally over a development length 0 < x/D < 20 for a uniform flow with a Mach 3.9 condition at the duct inlet. The experiments were conducted in a duct that was designed specifically to minimize wave effects and nozzle-induced distortion in the flow. Total pressure contours and local skin friction coefficient distributions show that the flow develops in a manner similar to that observed for the incompressible case. In particular, undulations exist in total pressure contours within the cross plane and in transverse skin friction coefficient distributions, indicating the presence of a well-defined secondary flow superimposed upon the primary flow. The results are analyzed to show that local law-of-the-wall behavior extends well into the corner region, which implies that wall functions conventionally applied in two-equation-type turbulence models, when suitably defined for compressible flow, may also be applied to supersonic streamwise corner flows.

AB  - The numerical finite-difference procedure of Gosman et al. (1969) is used to predict the growth of the tangential velocity profile and boundary-layer displacement thickness across an isothermal laminar axial flow through a concentric annulus when the inner cylinder is rotated at speeds which are insufficient to generate Taylor vortices. Solutions are obtained for fully developed and for developing axial flow over the ranges 0.05 <$0.98, 0.0002 < l < 1.0 and 100 < Re < 1700. The axial velocity profile is predicted to be insensitive to core rotation and, if varied, to influence only marginally the development of the tangential velocity profile; this is such that its dimensionless displacement thickness is related to dimensionless axial distance by a power law except near full development and at very low Reynolds number. Predictions at high Re accord extremely well with measurements. Astill's (1964) stability criterion for the onset of vortices in tangential developing flow is accordingly presented afresh in terms of system parameters readily available to the designer.

AB  - The influence of riser diameter on the axial and radial solids flux and flow development is studied in three riser circulating fluidized bed reactors of different diameters (76, 100 and 203 mm i.d. risers). A suction probe was used for the direct measurement, while the calculated local solids flux data obtained from solids velocity and concentration measured by two separate fibre optic probes were used to compare. Two shapes were found for the radial profile of the solids flux, a parabolic shape and a flat core shape. The shapes obtained could be predicted, based on the operating conditions, using a new concept of the effective solids saturation carrying capacity. The radial profile of solids flux is less uniform in a larger riser than in a smaller riser. Flow development is slower with the increase of riser diameter. The operating conditions were found to affect the solids flux in each reactor in the same general fashion: increasing gas velocity decreased the amount of downflow solids in the risers; increases in the solids circulation rate caused more solids to flow downwards. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Flow patterns for adiabatic vertical downward air-water flow in an 8.8. mm diameter channel have been studied. In particular, the influence of the inlet device, the flow history and the development length on the flow pattern have been investigated and assessed. Test results with two inlet devices (highly mixed and unmixed) indicate that the inlet device has a major influence on the flow pattern transitions. Furthermore, the transition boundaries between different flow regimes have been found to depend strongly on the flow's development length, and display hysteresis effects. Not surprisingly, no existing flow pattern map worked well versus the current observations, nor did they agree with one another, thus pointing the need to better characterize the test section inlet geometry, the influence of the test length and the test procedure to obtain genuine flow pattern observations. Presently, it can be concluded that in each flow pattern region there are important differences in the actual flow structures. A future mechanistic flow pattern map should then not only contain flow pattern transition lines but also physical characteristics which describe the flow regime and inlet device effects. This was qualitatively done in this study by superimposing on the flow pattern maps frames which illustrate the characteristics of the flow for two different inlet devices. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - According to the 2007 world demographic revision report of the United Nations, urban areas are expected to absorb 60% of the world's population by 2030. Developed countries have experienced the effect of urban development on their water resources since the Second World War and today think about alternative techniques and management rules to protect them. Solutions are developed under the scope of the resilience concept to cope with global change effects, i.e. both land-use and climate changes. We deal here with the consequences and the way to get quantitative evidence on how urban development can change flood and low flow regimes. We also address how on-site rainwater retention can help to mitigate such effects. This paper is connected with the paper entitled "Flood risk mitigation using dry reservoirs in a global change perspective" presented by Radojevic et al. (2010b).

AB  - The issue of geographical scale in implementing sustainable urban development has not received much attention in sustainability research. Is it possible to locate sustainability efforts to one part of the city and by creating a spatial imbalance expect that these efforts gradually spread to the rest of the city? For this purpose this paper proposes a model of unbalanced sustainable development. The model is based on an old theory in development economics, namely unbalanced growth. The author contends that such a model should be suitable for many cities where the opportunities for more comprehensive city-wide sustainable development strategies are limited.

AB  - A system for precision measurement of fluid velocity is developed and applied to determine the laminar flow distribution in a square duct. The experimental technique consists of measuring the Doppler shift of laser radiation scattered by particles moving with the fluid. From this frequency shift, the fluid velocity is inferred. Measurements in the entrance region and fully developed flow region of a square duct indicate that the velocity profile development takes place in a somewhat longer section of the duct than had been predicted. Measurements of the fully developed flow indicate that the optical technique used is capable of measuring velocity within an accuracy of at least 0.1 percent.

AB  - In the early morning of January 19, 2005, heavy rainfall triggered a rapid fill-slope failure at the crest of an escarpment in the District of North Vancouver, Canada. The landslide destroyed two homes, killing one person and seriously injuring another. Following the landslide, a program was implemented to quantify and manage the risk of loss of life arising from future fill-slope failures as well as facilitate communication amongst stakeholders. Quantitative risk tolerance criteria developed for application in Hong Kong were adopted, on an interim basis, to prioritise remediation efforts.

AB  - We present experimental results on the mean flow development and potential core lengths of single- and dual. stream compressible air jets. The research is relevant to noise emission. thermal signature, and combustion in high-speed turbulent jets. The primary flow was set at Mach number 1.5, and the secondary stream was supplied at four subsonic Mach numbers from nozzles of variable area and shape. Coaxial and eccentric nozzle configurations were investigated. In the coaxial arrangements, the secondary flow reduces the growth rate of the primary shear layer and elongates the primary potential core. As a result, the mass entrainment rate of the coaxial jet is less than that of the single jet. The potential core is stretched by 68% when a secondary stream with area ratio 2.9 is supplied at Mach number 0.9. The eccentric configuration shows substantial improvement in mixing over the coaxial case and achieves an entrainment rate roughly equal to that of the single jet when the exit areas of the primary and secondary streams are approximately equal. On an equal mass flow rate basis, the eccentric dual-stream jet with area ratio 0.9 actually mixes faster than the single jet. The potential core and the supersonic region of the jet are elongated much less than in the coaxial case. A semi-empirical model, based on the present data and classical shear layer relations, is proposed for the primary and secondary core lengths of coaxial jets.

AB  - The flow development of Herschel-Bulkley fluids in a sudden three-dimensional square expansion is studied numerically. The flow is modeled using the mixed-Galerkin finite element formulation to solve the conservation of mass and momentum equations. The Herschel-Bulkley material behavior is described using a regularized model based on the Papanastasiou model. Solutions are obtained for a downstream-to-upstream expansion ratio of 2:1 and for a wide range of pressure gradient values and rheological parameters. The results show that, during the evolution of the flow, two core regions and dead zones at the corners are formed. The extent of the core regions decreases with the pressure gradient and the Reynolds number, and increases with the power-law index. It is also found that the volume flow rate at steady flow increases with the pressure gradient, power-law index, and Reynolds number. (C) 1999 The Society of Rheology. [S0148-6055(99)02103-3].

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a finite difference experiment to simulate the transient development of the convection column above a strip of uniform high temperature source in a stratified uniform cross flow atmosphere. The ?-Îµ model of turbulence is used and an upstream weighted scheme for this vorticity-stream function formulation is employed. Some computation results for a 195?m wide source are presented. The immediate goal of the undertaking was to devise a scheme which could yield realistic flow ?boundary conditions? in the immediate vicinity of a fire to enable one to model the detailed structure of the fire region. The predictions arc quite consistent with observations and this provides the link between the heat source and environmental parameters. This scheme, together with a refined near zone fire model, can be used to describe the interplay between the heat source (fire) component and the environmental components of a mass fire system

AB  - The Motorola System on Chip Design Technologies (SoCDT) team aims
at providing a system design environment for its customers. The Toulouse
branch concentrates on design efforts incorporating DSP functionality.
This is referred to as the Catalyst methodology. We found that in
current systems, very often the software development cycle is longer
than that of the silicon development. To ease the software burden, we
have changed the silicon architecture and its flow to permit the DSP
software to be written in the C language instead of assembler code, as
is normally done. The resulting architecture is domain specific; it is
smaller, has a reduced design cycle and is simpler to implement because
it is tuned to the application software we are providing. The paper
describes the methodology which we are developing to create domain
specific architectures, it shows one example architecture and aspects
which are critical for industry acceptance

AB  - The RAMS model, in its latest version (V6), is used to simulate the flow around a set of buildings with a resolution of 1-2 meters in all directions. The k-?? and k-?? RNG turbulence parameterization were implemented in the RAMS model. The first one is commonly used in urban environments, however it was found to have some deficiencies when applied to the simulation of flow impingement and separation. The second parameterization is found to overcome these deficiencies. Results show that the flow that develops around the buildings simulated in the present work is notably complex and was found to be sensitive both to the turbulence closure scheme and to the boundary conditions as specified at the buildings' walls. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Hesperian-Amazonian age volcanic shield, Alba Patera, has associated with it some of the largest volcanic flows on Mars. An early (Hesperian) flood-lava phase was followed by the extrusion of high-volume sheet and tube-fed lavas, many of which emerged from fissures on the flanks of a rising dome. Subsequently a plethora of sheet and tube-fed lavas were erupted from linear vents located either at or within 200 km of the present summit. These built complex flow fields which were erupted at rates several orders of magnitude greater than the maximum Hawaiian rates. Later (Amazonian) volcanism at Alba saw extrusions of long, narrow flows from two complex summit calde- ras whose formation is inferred to have been a direct result of magma supply to the volcano's flanks. The outflow of thermal energy related to emplacement of some single flows (6 x 10 ~ ergs) was substantially greater than the Earth's annual heat loss through volcanism and implies that patera building must have been a significant source of geologi- cally rapid heat loss from Mars during the early stages of volcanic centralization on the planet.

AB  - 'Transforming Cities with Transit' explores the complex process of transit and land-use integration in rapidly growing cities in developing countries. As one of the most promising strategies for advancing environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, and socially inclusive development in fast-growing cities, transit and land-use integration is increasingly being embraced by policy-makers at all levels of government. This book focuses on identifying barriers to and opportunities for effective coordination of transport infrastructure and urban development. Global best-case practices of transit-oriented metropolises that have direct relevance to cities in developing countries are first introduced. Key institutional, regulatory, and financial constraints that hamper integration and opportunities to utilize transit to guide sustainable urban development are examined in selected cities in developing countries. For this, the book analyzes their Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems and their impact on land development. The book formulates recommendations and implementation strategies to overcome barriers and take advantage of opportunities. It asserts that unprecedented opportunities have and will continue to arise for the successful integration of transit and land development in much of the developing world. Many cities in developing countries currently exhibit the pre-requisites - e.g., rapid growth, rising real incomes, and increased motorization and congestion levels - for BRT and railway investments to trigger meaningful land-use changes in economically and financially viable ways. Recommendations for creating more sustainable cities of the future range from macro-level strategies that influence land development and governance at the metropolitan scale to micro-level initiatives, like Transit Oriented Development (TOD), that can radically transform development patterns at the neighborhood level. The book will be of interest to a wide and diverse audience, including mayors, council members and other national and local policy makers, urban and transportation planners, transit-agency officials, and developers and staff of development financial institutions and others involved with TOD projects in rapidly growing and motorizing cities of the developing world.

AB  - Urban transportation planning and land-use policies play a pivotal role in every society and are the subjects of interest in many academic fields. Creating a tool that measures the benefits and costs associated with the built environment, which includes the surrounding land-use and transportation system, would allow decision makers to choose the best option available to them when deciding on those important issues. In addition to travel time, congestion, safety, energy, and environment, public health is an important subject that can be affected by a transportation system. The primary objective of this study is to develop models for different health-related variables including general health, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, asthma, and heart attack. This is to investigate the role of transportation, land-use, and the built environment variables along with demographic and socioeconomic factors on people?ì² health. The results of the analysis showed that increasing the transit use and decreasing the autouse have a significant positive impact on all the health variables except for asthma. It was found that every percent decrease in autouse would reduce the chance of obesity by 0.4%, high blood pressure by 0.3%, high blood cholesterol by 1.3%, and heart attack by 1%. In addition to the transit-oriented development, making the environment more pedestrian friendly could motivate people to be more physically active in their daily routines and have a healthier lifestyle.

AB  - Split-flow thin (SPLITT) fractionation devices have been widely used to separate macromolecules, colloids, cells and particles. Recently, the quadrupole magnetic flow sorter (QMS) has been reported in the literature as another family of SPLITT fractionation device. However, the separation performance observed in the experimental measurements is generally found to deviate from the ideal behaviour. Possible causes such as hydrodynamic lift force, high particle concentration and imperfect geometries have been extensively examined. However, the effects of flow development regions and fringing magnetic force field at the separation channel inlet and outlet, which are ignored by the theory, have not been investigated. The error introduced by ignoring these effects need to be rigorously studied so that the theory can be used to optimise operation flow rates with confidence. Indeed, we find in this paper that these ignored effects are responsible to the discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. A new theory has been proposed for optimisation of device operation. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial development of the inlet velocity profile in a uniformly porous channel and tube is investigated. For tubes which are very long compared with their radius, it is shown that above a critical Reynolds number of 2.3 the inlet velocity profile does not necessarily decay into the fully developed, similarity profile for an infinite tube. Rather, the structure of the flow throughout the entire tube is influenced by the inlet profile. This loss of validity of the similarity solution is due to the fact that the tube is of finite length and the inlet profile is not of the similarity form. The actual length of the tube is, however, unimportant. Analogous results hold for the flow in a porous channel, with a critical Reynolds number of approximately 6.

UDCs are increasingly involved in a form of urban governance which is characterized by political patronage. If this thesis is accurate then one implication could be that UDCs become more integrated into local institutional networks. There is a case for dedicated local bodies, with specialized expertise, which can act quickly and commercially, and which are not necessarily held back by entrenched local opinion. This raises the wider issue of the probable incompatibility between democracy and capitalism and/or free markets, a notion underpinning the UDCs. And, if we accept the general incompatibility thesis, then the case for UDCs might not seem so problematical. -from Editors

AB  - Swirl flow has applications in many of the engineering equipments. Good amount of calculations exist which have been developed for design of propellers. However, swirler design for combustion applications is different from that for propeller applications. In the former swirl flow is generated by the application of tangential component to the axial flow whereas in the latter swirl is generated by the rotating propellers. Therefore it comes under the category of rotating flows. Quite a few studies have been carried out on vane generated swirl flows over the past four decades. Majority of the studies were based on experiments. Over the last one decade, attention has been focused on the numerical predictions. Due to the advent of fast digital computers, nowadays the CFD studies are becoming the part of the design methodologies. This study mainly focuses attention on arriving at best vane angle from aerodynamic aspects for the combustion applications. As there are large number of flow and geometric parameters involved arriving at the best design by experimental methods is rather difficult compared to CFD analyses. The important geometric parameters are vane angle, vane numbers and hub to tip ratio. The flow parameter involves the selection of appropriate turbulence model for the prediction. The uniqueness of this study is in arriving at the best vane angle using appropriate turbulence models for both weak and strong swirl. To this end experimental and numerical studies have been carried out. It is found that no single turbulence model is able to handle both weak and strong swirl. From this study it is concluded that for weak swirl standard k - ?? model is sufficient whereas for strong swirl one has to resort to Reynolds stress model. The characteristics of swirl flow are evaluated by means of size of the recirculation zone, mass trapped in the recirculation zone and also the pressure drop. Over the range of vane angle investigated the best vane angle is found to be 45??. ?? 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Flow and pollutant dispersion in a densely built-up area of Seoul, Korea, are numerically examined using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled to a mesoscale model [fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)]. The CFD model used is a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations model with the renormalization group k-epsilon turbulence model. A one-way nesting method is employed in this study. MM5-simulated data are linearly interpolated in time and space to provide time-dependent boundary conditions for the CFD model integration. In the MM5 simulation, four one-way nested computational domains are considered, and the innermost domain with a horizontal grid size of 1 km covers the Seoul metropolitan area and its adjacent areas, including a part of the Yellow Sea. The NCEP final analysis data are used as initial and boundary conditions for MM5. MM5 is integrated for 48 h starting from 0300 LST 1 June 2004 and the coupled CFD-MM5 model is integrated for 24 h starting from 0300 LST 2 June 2004. During the two-day period, a high-pressure system was dominant over the Korean peninsula, with clear conditions and weak synoptic winds. MM5 simulates local circulations characterized by sea breezes and mountain/valley winds. MM5-simulated synoptic weather and near-surface temperatures and winds are well matched with the observed ones. Results from the coupled CFD-MM5 model simulation show that the flow in the presence of real building clusters can change significantly as the ambient wind speed and direction change. Diurnally varying local circulations mainly cause changes in ambient wind speed and direction in the present simulation. Some characteristic flows-such as the double-eddy circulation, channeling flow, and vertical recirculation vortex-are simulated. Pollutant dispersion pattern and the degree of lateral pollutant dispersion are shown to be complicated in the presence of real building clusters and under varying ambient wind speed and direction. This study suggests that because of the sensitive dependency of urban flow and pollutant dispersion on variations in ambient wind, time-dependent boundary conditions should be used to better simulate or predict them when the ambient wind varies over the period of CFD model simulation.

AB  - Gross flow development patterns have been monitored during slurry packing and compared for PEEK and stainless-steel liquid chromatographic microbore columns for different sorbents and slurry compositions. Flow-rate, pressure and apparent permeability data were collected with the help of a computer-aided monitoring technique. The development of the packing process under constant-pressure conditions, as detected by changes in the flow, has been found to have four characteristic stages, the development of which correlates with the final degree of compaction of the porous bed and with column efficiency. The parameters characterising porous structure - specific permeability, K(o), and specific column resistance, have been compared for different groups of packed columns. It has been found that they correlate weakly with the column efficiency and the packing pressure for the same group of sorbents and packing slurry chemical composition. However, packings performed under the same pressure regime but using differing slurry media produced different flow patterns and have shown vast variation both in the column efficiency and in the specific column resistance. The range of specific column resistance values observed in this study for 0.5-mm I.D. microcolumns was 250<??<900. A correlation of ?? with the column tubing material has been observed and attributed to wall effects. The proposed method for the assessment of the effectiveness of the packing procedure enables changes in the dynamics of the packing process caused by changes of the slurry chemistry or other packing parameters to be observed and thus, the packing procedure for new stationary phases to be effectively adjusted. The expected column efficiency (and particularly packing failure) can be estimated during packing, prior to chromatographic assessment of the column.
