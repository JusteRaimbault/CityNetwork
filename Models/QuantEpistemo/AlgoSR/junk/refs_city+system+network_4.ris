AB  - Steam boilers are used to generate steam in order to meet the duty requirements of cold process streams. The most common heat exchanger network layout associated with the boiler is a completely parallel design, where the duty of each cold process stream is met by an external hot utility stream. This observation suggests that the flow rate of steam needed for the system can be reduced, while maintaining the required duty, simply by introducing series connections to the layout of the network (Kim, J. K.; Smith, R. Cooling water system design. Chem. Eng. Sci. 2001, 56, 3641?3658). Phase change of saturated steam to saturated liquid plays a vital role in the targeting method as well as the design of the network layout, since the saturated liquid (and resulting reuse liquid) is also used to meet the cold process duty requirements. A hybrid graphical and mathematical technique for targeting and network synthesis is presented. The main objective of the technique is to reduce steam flow rate without compromising the duty requirements of the process heat exchangers. In order to assess the advantage of a hybrid technique, a case study is used where a steam savings of 29.6% is obtained, compaired with using just saturated steam. We further present a complete mathematical technique to demonstrate the advantage of the graphical targeting concept in solution time improvement.\nSteam boilers are used to generate steam in order to meet the duty requirements of cold process streams.

AB  - "When there are two or more data systems and none of them enumerates the population at an acceptable completeness level, concern about the bias due to underenumeration suggests an estimator which makes joint use of data compiled by the combined imperfect data systems.  Conventional dual system estimators are based on the existence of two separate data collection systems.  Dual system network estimators assume a main survey and a follow-up quality check survey.  The main survey adopts a multiplicity counting rule that combines two mutually exclusive partial counting rules."  Three dual system network estimators are presented.  "One was previously proposed by Sirken (1979) and is the natural analogue of the conventional dual system estimator.  The two other estimators are proposed as potential improvements, although neither of them is the natural analogue of the conventional dual system estimator.  The design effects of the three estimators are compared analytically and empirically with one another, and with those of the single system conventional and network estimators."  (summary in FRE)

AB  - An immune algorithm (IA) is proposed which can be applied to power system reactive power optimization. Comparing with the genetic algorithm, the proposed algorithm based on immune principle exists following salient features such as antigen recognition, memory mechanism, the boost or restriction of antibody generations, etc. In immune algorithm the objective function and the constraints are assimilated to the antigens and the solution of the problem is assimilated to the antibody. Through the calculation of affinity the antibody is evaluated and the the boost or restrain of its generation is determined, thus, the possibility of the evolutionary process falls into local optima is decreased. Through the memory mechanism the ability of local search is improved, therefore, the calculation is speeded up. The IA is used to the calculation of reactive power optimization in an actual 69-bus system and the calculation results by IA is compared with that by traditional genetic algorithm (GA), the comparison results show that the more optimal solution can be obtained by LA and the performance of IA is far better than that of GA.

Comparison of the north part of the Chinese national grid and the west state power grid in U.S. shows that the Chinese power gird is also a small-world. Then the achievements in collective dynamics of small-world networks are used to advance the analysis of cascading failure in power systems. We firstly analyze node failure and line breakdown respectively, and then proposed a Monte-Carlo simulation process to search root causes of cascading failure of Northern Chinese Power Grid. Simulation results show that cascading failure is high correlation to the statistical characters of these networks, especially the degree of the initial attack points and the character shortest path length of the restructured network after each step of components out of service, which are critical nodes and critical lines of the network. Historical statistical data of Chinese power system also shows similar rule of the existence of critical points in the networks.

AB  - A communications link can only be considered successful when the
desired information is delivered to a user of the communications
service. In these days of overwhelming digital information broadcast via
numerous wide-area networks including the Internet and corporate
intranets, the ability of an individual user to obtain relevant, needed
information is becoming increasingly difficult. Information filtering
systems perform a data extraction function, analyzing an incoming stream
of information and selecting information that matches the needs of its
users. Inclusion of an information filtering mechanism in the
communications system ensures that the desired information is delivered
to a user. Currently, information filtering systems are based on
proprietary implementations that are not easily moved to other
platforms, do not readily scale for larger volumes of information, and
cannot be easily modified to handle new forms of data. This paper
presents an overview of the work we have done using the relational
database model to implement an information filtering system. We describe
the prototype information filtering system we have developed and its
initial system accuracy and performance measurements. Use of the
relational model provides the information filter system with the

AB  - The determination of power system network topology for off-line studies is a relatively simple problem since one-line diagrams inherently describe system configuration. In real time environments, system configuration is dynamic. Breakers may operate at any time producing some of the following effects: 1) circuits may or may not be disconnected, 2) substations may or may not separate possibly forming new nodes, thus varying the total number of nodes in a system, and 3) an interconnected system may split into several separated areas. Unless provisions are made to automatically incorporate in real time the effects of breaker operations on system topology, any calculation and decision based on a wrong configuration would be dangerous, especially when most needed: immediately after the occurrence of the abnormality ity which lead to breaker operations.

AB  - This paper reports results from an analysis of the relationship between the structure of the city-to-city network of global airline passenger flows and the interstate world system. While many scholars suggest that the broader parameters of the world system structure the urban hierarchy embedded within or articulated to it, others argue that the urban hierarchy is decoupling from the world system. The analyses show that there has been some modest convergence in the distribution of power in the world city system. Moreover, they suggest that the mechanism for this convergence is the upward mobility of cities located in the semi-periphery and the east Asian region. The paper closes by considering the implication of these findings for a larger understanding of the relationship between globalisation, the structure of the world city system and its articulation with the world system.

AB  - Fossil-fueled steam-electric power plants have many outstanding advantages and are still one of the main power types in the world especially for non-European countries. The classic mathematic models are designed for traditional hydraulic governing steam turbine units. Single turbine and its control system models are used wildly for dynamic analysis in power system. Digital electro-hydraulic (DEH) control systems and coordinated control systems (CCS) are used in most of the modern large power boiler-turbine units. They are key elements in the operation of the power station and have great impact on the system responses to the frequency or load disturbances. But seldom researches are available for modern generation unit models with both CCS and boiler control systems. A general model of power plant with CCS control system is built for power system dynamic analysis. The proposed model is compared with the classic ones under given disturbance inputs. The simulated results show the CCS should be considered in power plant modeling for power system dynamic analysis.

Accurate load models capturing load behaviors during dynamics are therefore necessary to allow more precise calculations of power system controls and stability limits.

This paper deals with data recorded during the field experiments in power systems using a kind of multilayer feed forward (MLFP) networks with error back- propagation (BP) algorithm and a kind of aggregate load model with least square identification. The results show that the ANN model with the improved back-propagation learning rule have a satisfactory interpolation and extrapolation ability, and also have the ability to describe the voltage-power non-linear relationship of load dynamic characteristics.

Both of the two issues are considered as a whole in this paper. Some electrical indexes, such as line operating time, line operating costs, and cranking unit number, are introduced to reflect the electrical characteristics of power system network. At the same time, based on the topological characteristics of power system network, a topological index, node importance degree is introduced here to solve the optimization problem. Meanwhile, the classic Dijkstra algorithm and the genetic algorithm are employed to search the global optimal restoration sequence of target nodes and node restoration paths. The numerical tests on the IEEE 30 system validates the strategy proposed in this paper.

AB  - The Uruguayan power system is highly dependent on two 500 kV transmission lines connecting the largest generation site (Salto Grande) and the Argentinean interconnection in the North, to the largest loading area in the South. Actual occurrences, where both 500 kV lines tripped, lead the system to widespread blackouts including the critical area of Montevideo, the nation's capital district. This paper presents an investigation of a controlled separation of the Uruguayan network into two stable islands, using power swing blocking (PSB) and out-of-step tripping (OST) protection functions. The investigation is based on transient stability studies using comprehensive models and, on the role of PSB and OST covering many possible protection strategies. The study specifically compares the amount of load shedding necessary to achieve similar transient performance with and without a controlled islanding scheme. The results show first that the required load shedding is relatively high (about 500 MVA), and that the controlled islanding scheme allows similar transient performance with 20% saving of load curtailment.

The model is based on a sophisticated mover-stayer formulation of inter-city population migration, upon which is included the classical SIS dynamics of disease transmission which operates within each city. Our analysis studies the stability properties of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) of the full n-city system in terms of the reproductive number R(0). Should vaccination reduce R(0) below unity, the disease will be eradicated in all n-cities. We determine the precise conditions for which this occurs, and show that disease eradication by vaccination depend on the transportation structure of the migration network in a very direct manner.

AB  - We thank Peter Taylor for his insightful and even-handed comments.We agree that our work and the research of the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network have much to add to one another, and we see a bright future ahead for interdisciplinary world city research. We are grateful for the opportunity to respond, and we would like to use this rejoinder to take the next step toward that future by envisioning inquiry that builds on the complementarities of our two ap- proaches. Of course, we also respond to the critical points Taylor raises. In what follows, we first address these points, then further sharpen some of the differences between theGaWCapproach and our own.We conclude with a discussion of how scholarship that combines the strengths of these approaches might proceed.

AB  -  This paper presents a technique to evaluate nodal reliability in a hybrid power market. Reliability models for the power pool and bilateral suppliers have been developed using reliability network equivalents. The impact of customer response on nodal reliabilities is included in the technique. Optimal power flow is used to replace AC power flow to minimize total system cost in each contingency state. The IEEE RTS has been analyzed to illustrate the technique.

AB  - Optimum power system stabilizer design has been a difficult task due to the nonlinear dynamics of the synchronous generators. An optimum power system stabilizer which is compensated for the nonlinear operation of the machine is described. A simple linear model of the synchronous machine is obtained at a given operating point by linearizing the nonlinear machine equations. The nonlinear characteristics of the machine are compensated by changing the linear model parameters depending on the prevailing operating condition of the machine. Optimum state feedback gains of the controller are calculated for the different sets of model parameters and scheduled according to the operating state. The algorithm presented can be considered as a generalization of the gain scheduling adaptive algorithms. Machine dynamics for different operating conditions are simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of this algorithm. The results show that the dynamic stability of the system is improved

AB  - Geography is widely viewed as the important determinant of city location. This paper empirically disentangles the different roles of geography in shaping the European city system. We present a new database that covers all actual cities as well as potential city locations over the period when the foundations for the European city system were laid. We relate each location’s urban chances to its physical, first nature, geography characteristics, and develop a novel empirical strategy to assess how the existing urban system surrounding each location (second nature geography) determines its urban prospects. First nature geography is the dominant determinant of city location until the sixteenth century. Second nature geography becomes important from the seventeenth century onwards, in a way that corresponds closely to predictions from new economic geography theory.

AB  - This paper proposes the application of a novel voltage stability index computation scheme to microgrid (MG) interconnected power systems. The L-index provides an online mechanism for computing and rating the status of the interconnected system into the utility-supplied, pre-microgrid, microgrid-supplied and island operational modes for improved operation. It may also provide a triggering signal to control the point of common coupling (PCC) converter to reduce network voltage violations in situations where the MG system has the capability to inject reactive power to the grid during periods of emergency or peak loads. Simulation results obtained with IEEE 14 bus system with MG later connected to load bus twelve as a PCC to the microgrid system, showed the suitability of the developed model towards providing smooth operation under both normal and distressed conditions.

AB  - Due to the complexity of cascading failures and blackouts, the small world theory for complex network research is employed in probing the mechanism of them. In the paper, the original small world network model has been modified in two ways. Firstly, the magnitude of the line impedance regarded as the weight of edges is taken into consideration which is not considered in the original model. The formulae of corresponding parameters of the model are also modified. The calculation results of some practical grids validate the correctness and effectiveness of the new model. Secondly, the complex number format of power flow is introduced as the network flow in the small world model. With the power flow and the topology of grids, the two main factors to the system vulnerability, considered, the improved small world model can be used as a tool for vulnerability analysis of grids.

AB  - Distributed Generation (DG) is growing rapidly in power systems due to their potential solution for issues, like the deregulation in power system, to meet the power demand and the shortage of transmission capacities. Optimal placement of DG assumes significance that improper allocation of DG sources in power system would not only lead to increased power or energy losses, but can also jeopardize the system operation. Also optimal placement of DG is necessary for the maximization of reliability and stability in power system. In this paper classical grid search algorithm based on successive load flows has been employed to obtain optimal location and size of multiple DG units in radial power system network in order to minimize total active power losses and to improve voltage profile of the system. The proposed method is the extension of single DG placement to the placement of multiple DG units. It is significant because of the fact that with the integration of DG units at various locations, there is more reduction in total power losses and maximum voltage drop in the system is also decreased. The proposed method is tested on 12-bus radial distribution feeder with different sizes of DG source. The obtained results are presented in graphical manner

AB  - This article formulates a transit network design model for determining frequencies of each transit line in a network. This transit network design model requires a mode-split assignment model with distinct transit lines, each with its own specified frequency, to capture the mode split effects of increases or decreases in individual transit line frequencies. It is shown how to refine conventional mode-split assignment models to include this feature. The resulting model includes more precise measures of transit access and transfer delays, so that it more accurately predicts mode choices and link flows. This variation of the mode-split assignment model uses Dial's transit loader to solve Frank-Wolfe subproblems, using frequencies of individual transit lines to find fastest transit paths, considering access time, ride time, and any transfer delays. Computational shortcuts using the standard Hooke-Jeeves algorithm are demonstrated.

AB  - The real world is a three-dimensional (3D) space requiring that 3D geospatial information applications be developed in alignment with the observer's visual and perceptive habits. Particularly, 3D building model data are required in a wide range of areas such as urban planning, environmental protection, real estate management and emergency response. At the same time, the development of Web service technologies allows the possibility of the widely distributed 3D geospatial data on the web. 3D city building model with its related information is an important part in the construction of a digital city system, and has become a staple resource on the web nowadays. In view of the hierarchical representation of a 3D building model, an abstract of a 3D building model based on structure details is studied, and a novel representation approach named 3D transparent building hierarchical model is presented in this paper. This approach fully uses both the existing 3D modeling technologies and CAD constructing mapping data. By the spatial relationship description, structural components inside a building can be represented and integrated as hierarchical models in a unified 3D space. In addition, based on the characteristics of the 3D building model data, a service-oriented architecture and Web service technologies for 3D city building models are discussed. The aim of the approach is that 3D city building models can be used as a kind of data resource service on the web, and can also exist independently in various different web applications. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag 2010.

Coherency-based equivalence has been extensively used in engineering practice. However, there are still no wide-accepted rules or methods to decide the boundary of the retaining system and the system to be eliminated. This paper presents heuristic indices for preserving network decision and performance evaluation in power system dynamic equivalence. For validation purposes, this propose method is applied to a test system of IEEE 10 machine 39-bus system and dynamic equivalence of South China power grid in the year of 2010. Results show that the reduced system retains the dynamic performance of the original system with good accuracy, and the proposed method has good engineering value.

To setup a relatively easy-installation communication network system for transferring controlling and sensing information, a CDMA2000 based cellular wireless communication system, i.e., the PowerWDN network, is introduced to such power SCADAs in this paper. By comparison with other wireless and wired communication platforms, the performance of PowerWDN is analyzed when applied to transfer power system signals. It is eventually revealed that, although being a little slower in response to sudden faults in power networks if compared with wired communication networks, the PowerWDN will still be of great significance to many practical uses in modern power systems, especially when the virtual private networking (VPN) technique is being applied.

Average tuition and fee increases at NDUS institutions were significantly higher than their regional counterparts in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, as a result, the gap between tuition and fee rates at all NDUS institutions, except the 2-year campuses, and their regional counterparts has narrowed significantly in recent years. At the 2-year campuses the gap has widened significantly since 2003-04 with NDUS two-year campus tuition and fee rates, on the average, about $660 more than their regional counterparts. Funding for the needs based state grant program has not kept pace with tuition increases and has declined as a percent of estimated tuition collections, from 2.19 percent of estimated annual tuition collections in 1989-91 to 1.82 percent in 2007-09.

AB  - We propose a network management system which is suitable to disaster situation in U-city environment. U-city is a smart city with the intelligent convergence system that integrates IT technology and urban engineering technology such as environment, road traffic, safe and GIS. The network used in U-city should provide services without transmission failure and support functionality which enlarges the role of sensors used to collect information. Thus, a network management system which manages user's information is necessary. SNMP is the most widely used management protocol standard on the internet. But it manages a network has a static topology and the number of devices which are managed is small. To overcome SNMP problems, we propose an ubiquitous network management system (uNMS) that mobile devices in it is suitable in mobile network which go in and out U-city frequently and can manage lots of agents. And uNMS minimizes a usage of bandwidth. As shown in simulation results overheads are decreased about 40% and the connectivity is increased about 14%. When the mobility of mobile agents increases, the connectivity is 30% higher than SNMP.

AB  - Due to the increasing of power system fault and failure, voltage sag (dip) will occur instantaneously with respect to the fault and failure itself. The power system network consists of high voltage (HV), medium voltage (MV) and low voltage busbar (LV). Monitoring equipment in the power systems network are installed at strategic and appropriate 33/11 kV feeder. The propagation and the travelling of voltage sag from one busbar to another busbar can't be recorded in each part of the power system network. This paper has been written to investigate the propagation of voltage sag from one busbar to the other busbar through transformer connections due to power system faults. Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD/EMTDC) will be used to construct and simulate a power system model network. The results of this work later will be used to develop an empirical rule for the propagation of voltage sag in power system network. It is hoped that the empirical rule can be used for an example planning for voltage sag mitigation in the power system networks and monitoring purposes.

AB  - The research constitutes the first effort to test the claim found in the world city theoretical literature that, as world cities strengthen ties with each other, their linkages with their countries' hinterlands and national urban systems will weaken. This research offers a more nuanced exploration of this hypothesis by taking into account variation in the nature of the state across countries in which world cities are located as well as the source of global capital in the world cities. Specifically, the research reported here suggests that three types of world cities-market-centred bourgeois world cities (MWC), state-centred political bureaucratic world cities (SWC) and dual-role world cities (DWC)-entail different deterritorialisation outcomes. Three countries that have prototypical global cities-Japan (SWC), China (DWC) and the US (MWC) are compared, applying longitudinal network modelling to relational data on national city networks. From 1993 to 2007, more globally connected MWCs weakened their national ties. In contrast, higher global status has no significant effect on the integration of SWCs or DWCs with their national urban systems. This indicates that the type of state, but not the source of capital, conditions whether the world city will deterritorialise vis-A-vis its national city system.

AB  - This paper is to investigate the power system operation strategy for an electrified mass rapid transit ( MRT ) network to enhance the loading factors of main transformers. The train motion equation has been applied to find the mechanical power demand profiles of the train set according to various operation modes by considering operation resistance. The DC load flow analysis is executed to derive the electric power loading of each traction substation and the AC load flow analysis is then performed to solve the dynamic loading behavior of main transformers for each time snapshot. To improve the loading factors of main transformers, the proper strategy of unit commitment and load transfer by switching operation are determined for the MRT operation during the peak and off peak periods. The Taipei MRT network is selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It is found that the loading factors of main transformers can be improved dramatically and the load balance among the transformers can be obtained by the proposed methodology.

AB  - Many opportunities exist to improve micro-architectural performance due to performance events that are difficult to optimize at static compile time. Cache misses and branch mis-prediction patterns may vary for different micro-architectures using different inputs. Dynamic optimization provides an approach to address these and other performance events at runtime. This paper describes a software system of real implementation that detects performance problems of running applications and deploys optimizations to increase execution efficiency. We discuss issues of detecting performance bottlenecks, generating optimized traces and redirecting execution from the original code to the dynamically optimized code. Our current system speeds up many of the CPU2000 benchmark programs having large numbers of D-Cache misses through dynamically deployed cache prefetching. For other applications that don't benefit from our runtime optimization, the average cost is only 2% of execution time. We present this lightweight system as an example of using existing hardware and software to deploy speculative optimizations to improve a program's runtime performance.

AB  -  The indices, models and algorithms of evaluating cascading outages in power systems are proposed in this paper. At first, four deterministic and two probabilistic indices are defined for evaluating the cascading outages. These indices can reflect the practical distribution of the loss load and the severity of the failure. Uniting the network configuration with bus schemes of power substations, the cascading model of power systems is set up subsequently. In order to take into account the effect of protection systems, a new reliability model of protection systems is presented based on the fact that faults of protection systems can be reflected by the actions of breakers. An efficient algorithm is developed based on the above models, which incorporates all causes of cascading faults and achieves quantitative evaluation of power systems cascading faults. The algorithm includes five parts: fault analysis of bus station, trace of the network topology, judgment of the network connectivity, evaluation of system states and statistic of indices. In order to improve the computation efficiency, several techniques are adopted in the assessment. Cases study indicates that the presented approach can find the bottleneck of the network and discover the hidden failure of power systems.

AB  - This report describes the motivations behind the development of the Balmorel model as well as the model itself. The purpose of the Balmorel project is to develop a model for analyses of the power and CHP sectors in the Baltic Sea Region. The model is directed towards the analysis of relevant policy questions to the extent that they contain substantial international aspects. The model is developed in response to the trend towards internationalisation in the electricity sector. This trend is seen in increased international trade of electricity, in investment strategies among producers and otherwise. Also environmental considerations and policies are to an increasing extent gaining an international perspective in relation to the greenhouse gasses. Further, the ongoing process of deregulation of the energy sector highlights this and contributes to the need for overview and analysis. A guiding principle behind the construction of the model has been that it may serve as a means of communication in relation to the policy issues that already are or that may become important for the region. Therefore, emphasis has been put on documentation, transparency and flexibility of the model. This is achieved in part by formulating the model in a high level modelling language, and by making the model, including data, available at the internet. Potential users of the Balmorel model include research institutions, consulting companies, energy authorities, transmission system operators and energy companies.

AB  - This report focuses on distance education within the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) for the 2007-08 academic year and provides documentation of the substantial growth of distance education within all colleges and universities. Distance education is a field of continuous improvement and change, and NSHE institutions are constantly working to extend their offerings beyond their physical limits to meet the learning needs of students in Nevada. Without distance education many students, especially those living in Nevada's extensive rural areas and those with heavy work or family commitments, would not be able to pursue their higher education goals. The following are a few of the major highlights in this report: (1) The number of students enrolled in at least one distance education course increased from 5,798 in Fall 2001 to 24,656 in Fall 2007, an increase of 18,858 students or 325 percent; (2) The College of Southern Nevada (CSN) will soon launch the CSN Online Campus. The CSN Online Campus will meet the needs of the 100 percent online learners by providing all of the courses, programs, and services that are commonly provided to students attending traditional on campus courses and programs; (3) In order to provide a more robust support structure, Western Nevada College's (WNC) Library & Media Services reference librarians assumed responsibility as the first contact for students enrolled in online classes. This arrangement worked well over the past several years, with a record number of over 550 calls for assistance handled in student support; (4) Building on the universal deployment of WebCampus, all students admitted to Nevada State College (NSC) are enrolled automatically in an online course called "Student WebCampus Orientation". The course includes all of the WebCampus learning tools with related learning exercises; (5) Truckee Meadows Community College's (TMCC) WebCollege is developing a fast-track online degree program (courses offered in a 5-week online format) which will target nontraditional working adults and will offer an accelerated solution for degree completion. The degree program is slated to be launched in Spring 2010 and will feature credit for lifelong learning experience (where appropriate), a student academic plan, fostering student learning communities, and will focus on degree completion for nontraditional students; (6) The University of Nevada, Reno's (UNR) Teaching, Learning, and Technology staff is very active in training faculty to teach online. More than 1,000 class sections each semester have technology components. Technical support for online students through the Knowledge Center is excellent; (7) Since 2005, the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) Distance Education Office captions all streaming videos, which are used by distance education courses and sometimes the instructors' face to face campus sections. The captioning of videos ensures Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. The shared use of distance education created materials utilizes scarce UNLV resources and upgrades educational effectiveness across the campus; and (8) Great Basin College's (GBC) distance education offerings currently account for over 51 percent of GBC's overall enrollment. Great Basin College's WebCampus continues to grow at an exceptional rate. The WebCampus has seen a 142 percent increase in FTE from Fall 2005 to Fall 2007. Students increasingly demand and expect distance education offerings. In order to meet the rising demand, some important elements should be examined in a statewide coordinated effort: infrastructure, faculty development and support, student services, accessibility, and the policies that govern distance education.

AB  - Globalization has renewed interest in the place and role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (and their residents) has become increasingly tied to their po- sition in international ﬂows of investment and trade. Data on the branch locations of the worlds 500 largest multinational enterprises in 2000 are subjected to two broad types of network analytic tech- niques in order to analyze the world city system. First, 3,692 cities are analyzed in terms of three measures of point centrality. Second, blockmodeling techniques are employed to generalize further about the positions and roles played by cities in the system. These tech- niques are used to trace out the structure of the world city system, locate cities in the context of a global urban hierarchy, and explore the degree to which this diverges from a simple one-to-one matching of cities onto nation-states in the world system.

AB  - This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to power system switching operations in normal states. The proposed multi-agent system consists of several Facilitator-Agents (FAGs), Equipment-Agents (EAGs) and Switch-Box-Agents (SBAGs). FAG acts as a manager for negotiation process between agents. EAG corresponds to an equipment of the electric power system such as a bus, a transformer and a transmission line, while SBAG is a pseudo-object which consists of neighboring circuit breakers and disconnecting switches. The proposed multi-agent system realizes appropriate switching operations by interacting with neighboring agents. Computer tests on a model system show that the proposed approach is effective and promising.

AB  - With the advent of modern day satellite technology, the electric utility industry is exploring opportunities to expand applications that can be served from space-based platforms. Traditionally, in the electric power industry the use of satellite-based technology is seen in many aspects of wide-area management -- weather satellites are used to provide information on demand and to thus, lower the probability of blackouts or brownouts; GPS satellites are used for system control by providing synchronized measurements; and Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites are being investigated for communication of the power system measurements with the desire to improve reliability and provide global coverage with low data latency. These LEO satellites are typically 500 -1500 km above the Earth's surface. The integration of satellite technology into power system operations is emerging now due not only to the large coverage area available from space, improvements in satellite reliability, and lower data-latency, but also the advent of lower cost small satellite buses. Today, satellite applications for power systems are an active area of research in such areas as wide area measurement, control, and communication.

AB  -  In modern power systems, it is important to analyze many dynamic phenomena which appear on the system when the usefulness of new power electronic based apparatus protective relay systems and others is verified, for which a real-time power system simulator is becoming a very effective means. In general, however, it is very expensive and it is very difficult for beginners to understand how to use it. Therefore, studies on low-cost and easy-use real-time power system simulators have so far been done. We have developed models of power system components for the real-time power system simulator using DSP (digital signal processor) combined with commercial CAD (computer aided design) software "MATLAB/SIMULINK". The use of commercial software can drastically decrease the development cost of the simulator. In this paper, a simplified reduction model of a transmission network consisting of unbalanced three phase transmission line with mutual impedance is proposed for reducing computing time for the transmission network of the digital simulator.

AB  - According to current application of the power system communication services and communication technology and network structure, a mathematical method of safety and risk assessment of electric power communication services is carried out. Considering the typical topology SDH transmission system network which is used widely in power system, this paper introduces the concept of the safety classification, importance degree of power system communication service, communication network point and transmission segment risk. This paper divides the risk into two kinds, recessive risk which is the risk caused by communication failure that will influence the power system directly and dominant risk which is the risk that influence power system indirectly. Using RBD (Reliable Block Diagram) and PRA (Probabilistic Reliability Assessment) the method, which combine reliability of communication network communication point or electric power optical cable, characteristics of power system operations classification, importance degree of power system operations together, can calculates reliability of power system communication services which have different communication channel organization patterns from point to point, and risks, including recessive risk and dominant risk, caused by power system communication service interruption and reliability degeneration for single communication network point or optical cable failure. It is proved that the method have very good practicality and operability according to the calculation result. The service reliability and risk assessment value calculated by this method accords with current application situation. This method can be used not only in reliability and risk assessment of power system communication network carrying the power system operations, but also in the power system communication service channel's optimization and adjustment while during common power system running and overhaul of the communication network.

AB  - We report the results of a historical investigation and quantification of discontinuous evolution, and a gap statistic analysis of discontinuities, on city size distributions of the city system in Texas, USA, over a 160-year period from 1850 to 2010. The growth of the city system exhibits four stages that are evident from our quantitative analysis of the convergence of population in large cities and qualitative analysis of historical socioeconomic and technological developments. The decadal city size distributions in the aggregate evolve with a persistent pattern while individual cities over time shift positions in the urban hierarchy as the result of adapting or passing growth opportunities in infrastructure innovations, economic change, and industrial transformations. These decadal city size distributions exhibit persistent discontinuities that mainly occur in the upper and lower tails. The observed patterns and discontinuities are indicative of the stability and resilience of a complex adaptive system of cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is broadly recognized in the aerospace industry, as well as many others, that organizations which effectively execute development projects to meet desired cost, schedule, and performance targets for their customers produce higher levels of customer satisfaction and also a significant source of competitive advantage. Continually meeting the needs of the customer through effective project execution allows a company to become a preferred supplier favored in source selection for follow-on contracts and new development projects necessary for business growth. This research effort examines one aerospace company, which has multiple, diverse development projects on-going at any one time across several business units. The motivation for this thesis is to explore the product/system development capacity of the enterprise by analyzing the historical program performance of major projects, understanding the level of problem projects or fire fighting within the project pipeline, and the perceived causes of poor project performance. In addition, system dynamics models are developed to analyze the dynamics associated with project planning and resource planning strategies for both multi-project and single project scenarios. This analysis provides insight into the potential for project pipeline "tipping" and the effects of various project management and resource planning strategies in an aerospace product/system development context. Such analysis is believed to provide greater insight and opportunity to improve the product/system development performance for the enterprise.

AB  - Characterization of rainfall variation in time and space is an indispensable part of crop monitoring for food security in Africa. In order to compensate for sparse and late- reporting rain gauge stations, early warning systems often rely upon indirect estimates of precipitation. Examples are estimates derived from satellite imagery and output fields from numerical models of the atmosphere. In order to support workshop discussions, rapid and limited comparisons of two such data sets were made against available station data for a region of western Kenya. Substantially better agreement with station data was observed for the satellite rainfall estimates than was the case with atmospheric model reanalysis fields. Though limited in scope, we believe the results are indicative of the relative performance of these two classes of indirect rainfall estimators.

AB  -  This work proposes a methodology and a practical tool for the study of long-term network planning under uncertainties. In this approach the major external uncertainties during the planning horizon are modeled as macroscenarios at different future time instants. On the other hand, the random nature of actual operating conditions is taken into account by using a probabilistic model of microscenarios based on past statistics. Massive Monte-Carlo simulations are used to generate and simulate a large number of scenarios and store the detailed results in a relational database. Data mining techniques are then applied to extract information from the database so as to rank scenarios and network reinforcements according to different criteria.

AB  - Most studies of the size, growth, and distribution of cities have been\nbased on Western economies and have identified economic factors such as\nscale and agglomeration economies and level of economic development as\nmajor determinants of urban growth. It is unclear whether these\ngeneralizations are applicable in socialist economies. In this paper, I\nargue that institutional factors have played key roles in shaping\nChina's city system, which is characterized by declining population\nconcentration across cities and by tremendous vertical (population\ngrowth of cities) and horizontal (addition of new cities) expansions.\nThe empirical analysis focuses on describing the size distribution of\ncities, estimating a multivariate model predicting the population growth\nof cities, and performing a logistic regression analysis of new and\nexisting cities. The findings underscore the effects of urban and\nregional development policies, socialist institutions, changes in the\nurban administrative system, and state and local government interests,\nand suggest that they as a whole are more important than economic\nfactors in explaining the attributes and changes of China's city system.

AB  - The phenomenon of globalization has renewed interest in thinking about the place & role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (& their residents) has become increasingly tied to their position in international flows of investment & trade. While some have suggested the appropriateness of network techniques for the study of the global urban system, few have effectively realized their application. Utilizing data on the branch locations of the world's 500 largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 1981 & 2000, we employ network analytic techniques to examine change in the structure of the world city system. First, we evaluate the more than 3000 cities that are knit together in the MNE-generated city system in terms of three measures of point centrality (viz., degree, betweenness, & closeness) at both time points. Second, we use these measures to answer a series of questions regarding the development of the world city system: (1) How extensively has the structure of the world city system been altered across the era of globalization? (2) Have power & prestige in the world city system grown more concentrated? (3) Have cities been decoupled from "traditional" political geography in the course of globalization? In answering these questions, we trace out the changing structure of the world city system & address key concerns in the literature regarding its evolution.

AB  - Electric power system network planning is influenced by the uncertainty in many parameters, such as future customer-demand/fossil-fuel-price parameter projections and new generation plant locations, which can generally be modeled in an approximate or subjective manner at best. Historically recorded wind power data presented here supports the contention that medium-term wind power generation profiles tend to follow more stable probability distributions. While it is widely acknowledged that the addition of wind power to a system makes network investment analysis more difficult in some respects, such data patterns nevertheless evoke an important discussion on how this relatively more probabilistic (i.e. not uncertain) characteristic of wind power may have some positive value for transmission planning and its related decision making procedures.

AB  - Despite the successful application of information technology to power system, there is still a lack of some application of information theory to power system. In the paper, a new concept named power system information theory is proposed to answer how to apply information theory to power system systematically. Here, decision-making for power system is treated as an information reconstructing process firstly. Then a generalized information channel model for decision-making is built, the uncertainty of probability-type information of power system is quantified, and based on a new principle for the minimization of information loss (MIL), a decision-making method in power system is proposed. The new method is applied to online topology error identification. Based upon information theory, topology error identification can be modeled by a novel optimization problem, which is much different from the traditional rule based methods. This quantified result will benefit topology error identification. Case study has been done to show the validity and efficiency of the principle and method proposed in this paper.

The NF-κB/Jurkat/GFP™ cells were derived from the human T lymphocyte-based Jurkat cell line. Jurkat cells were transduced with HIV-based pseudoviral particles packaged with an expression vector encoding the GFP reporter gene driven by the minimal cytomegalovirus (mCMV) promoter in conjunction with four copies of the NF-κB consensus transcriptional response element upstream of mCMV (Figure 1). Positively transduced cells were cloned by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), and clonal populations that stably retained the proviral expression construct in Jurkat cell genomic DNA over many passages were selected. Clones that demonstrated a robust (≥ 30- fold) increase in GFP expression upon stimulation with TNF-α at 10 ng/ml for 24 hours were chosen for further development of the cell line (Figure 2). The resulting NF-κB/Jurkat/GFP™ cell line is the clonal population that exhibited the lowest background and the strongest response to TNF-α stimulation (Figure 3, page 3).

AB  - With an ever increasing amount of information being transmitted electronically, it is important that security be considered in every phase of local area network design and maintenance. Although much emphasis has been placed on such things as wireless networks and remote access, it is imperative that the core local area network not be overlooked. Because the wired local area network is the nervous system of an organization’s Information Systems, great care must be taken to properly secure it. This chapter begins by looking at the implications for the wired local area network infrastructure security. Next, local area network segmentation and traffic isolation will be discussed. By using segmentation and isolation, there is the increased opportunity for security boundaries. Another concept that will be discussed is the security of the local area network equipment. The local area network is only functional if the core equipment is operational, so securing equipment is an important part of any security strategy. To conclude, restriction of local area network access will be investigated and an organizational approach will be discussed. Because more and more users need access to local area network resources, there must be a way to identify and restrict who is allowed on the network and what access they are granted. In wired local area network infrastructure security, organizations must remember they are only as secure as their weakest point. By carefully considering the various aspects of the local area network security during design, these weak points can be reduced and the overall security of the network increased. Although it is impossible to be 100% secure and still be functional, by using some general guidelines to secure the wired local area network, many threats to the network can be reduced if not eliminated.

Second, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network with orthogonal least square learning is used to adapt feedback gains, which correspond with Riccati equation. The proposed method AOPSS is illustrated with application to design of stabilizer for a single generator connected to an infinite bus under various disturbances. The eigenvalue analysis and the time domain simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed AOPSS to improve damping characteristics and to enhance the system stability over wide range of loading conditions.

AB  - Transient stability is a characteristic that must be considered whenever an electric power system is expanded. Transient control methods using conventional continuous controls are well documented, but transient control can also be achieved using discrete control methods. This tutorial paper presents descriptions of ten discrete transient stability controls. Each description tells how the control acts to maintain stability, what effect its operation has on generating station mechanical and electrical equipment, and provides references to detailed articles. The paper could serve as a starting point for detailed investigation of a particular control method.

AB  - This overview of DISN is a summary of what DISN is today, tomorrow
and a projection of the future. It begins with a large number of
non-integrated legacy networks that are substantial in size and the
initial integration of these systems to improve performance and reduce
cost. Emerging requirements for image, voice and data are projected to
push DISN into the gigabit arena to support the information requirements
of DoD that are associated with &amp;ldquo;new ways of doing
business&amp;rdquo;. Enabling technologies are progressing on many fronts
and are producing performance at a cost that was only &amp;ldquo;dreamed
about&amp;rdquo; a decade previously. How DISN might use these technologies
in its evolution is discussed. DISN's overall goal for post 2000 is
summarized. The potential is high for significant overall cost savings
and performance improvement as a result of a DISN that allows
consolidation and centralization of a number of functions and also
enables distributed interactive processes such as modelling and
simulation, joint planning, exercises, computing, conferencing, et. al.,
all of which are discussed in other papers

AB  - Power system stabilizers (PSS) are used to generate supplementary control signals for the excitation system in order to damp the low frequency power system oscillations. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional PSS (CPSS), numerous techniques have been proposed in the literature. Based on the analysis of existing techniques, this paper presents an indirect adaptive neural network based power system stabilizer (IDNC) design. The proposed IDNC consists of a neuro-controller, which is used to generate a supplementary control signal to the excitation system, and a neuro-identifier, which is used to model the dynamics of the power system and to adapt the neuro-controller parameters. The proposed method has the features of a simple structure, adaptivity and fast response. The proposed IDNC is evaluated on a single machine infinite bus power system under different operating conditions and disturbances to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

AB  - The majority of educators today are locked in a system that prepares students for a world that has long since passed, instead of a future that is already here. While the world continues to change rapidly, the ability to react to those changes is stymied by age old beliefs about what education should be, increasingly irrelevant expectations and mandatory assessments, and their own lack of understanding as to how these tools and these technologies fundamentally change the way they learn. Challenge as educators right now is to begin to reenvision their classrooms and their practice in order to help their students leverage these new connections and networks and, to put it bluntly, to stay relevant in their learning lives. This requires thinking deeply about the types of skills and literacies that 21st century learners will need in order to be as successful as they can be. More and more, the skills that their students need to take with them are those that will provide a strong foundation for their own lifelong learning, ones that help them navigate a much more complex and changing landscape of information.

AB  - On-line power system analysis enables to make power mode-related decision based on information available at real time. The quality of the studies and efficiency of power system operation are closely associated with the accuracy of the power system models. Accurate and quick decision based on analysis on real time data has been necessary for making operational plan under the deregulation of power system world wide. In addition there has been phenomenal expansion of power system in India in recent times especially after introduction of Electricity Act 2003, introduction of open access and emergence of power markets through power exchanges have brought complexities in power system operation and control. Power network analysis on real time data is expected to further enhance the critical role in grid operation after proposed regulations for fixing the transmission tariff and loss apportionment. All these have necessitated power system analysis on real time conditions very accurate but based on diverse principle. In order to meet all requirements ranging from monitoring, commercial, reliability and stability angle, an attempt has been made to adopt hybrid nature of network model in real time supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system which has till date works on an integrated single network model. In this paper it is proposed for a theoretical basis of network modeling and the same is adapted in southern regional load despatch center (SRLDC) Bangalore India and analysis using energy management system (EMS) tools for the real time system. It has been shown how a systematic planning can make on-line network modeling and analysis relatively simple under complex operational requirement. Experimental results show that adaptation of on-line power management strategies can be a key tool in the hands of control engineers in the complex power system operation scenario.

AB  -  This paper presents parameter tuning of conventional power system stabilizer (CPSS) by artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN in the paper is radial basis function network (RBFN), whose parameters are chosen by adaptive orthogonal least squares (adaptive OLS) algorithm, to compensate error of linear model of power system where a fixed-parameter CPSS is analyzed. The adaptive OLS algorithm is developed from the orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm to reduce the neural network size more efficiently. When the system condition is changed, this makes the fixed-parameter CPSS less efficient than a varied-parameter CPSS by ANN. Moreover, the adjustment of damping coefficient using the gradient descent method improves the oscillation damping.

AB  - Literacy is examined from the viewpoint of systemic linguistics. It is proposed that "literacy" means intervening in the social processes by working with written language, and this can not be accomplished by an individual alone. "Using written language" can not be isolated from "using language." While sociologically, it may make sense to treat literacy as a thing in itself, linguistically, it does not. Writing may have its own grammar, discourse semantics, and genres, but everyone who writes, speaks; and the primary context of writing is speaking. All ideologies in literate cultures are the product of both; not the sum of the two, but the dialectic between them. At this level, it makes little sense to treat literacy and oracy separately; the concept needed is that of "articulacy," or making meaning by using text in context.

AB  - Services and agencies continue to deploy IP SATCOM systems while awaiting migration to the joint IP modem (JIPM). As the JIPM nears production, challenges such as establishing responsibility for development of a common end user terminal, satellite and hub resource allocation and management, and long term sustainment for the end-to-end SATCOM infrastructure must be addressed. Currently, the DoD gateway hosts numerous IP SATCOM systems including Linkway, iDirect, and DVB-RCS. All of the SATCOM systems are responsible for providing defense information systems network (DISN) connectivity and services to the warfighter. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) aims to establish commonality and interoperability among the current capabilities. To achieve this end state, DISA is evaluating the establishment of a DISN satellite service (DSS) provided as an extension of existing IP SATCOM systems, DISN transport, and RF services embedded at the DOD gateways. As part of the DISN satellite service, DISA is designing a ubiquitous IP SATCOM suite capable of providing DISN connectivity and access to all of the DISN services including VTC, VoIP, NIPR, and SIPR. This paper will further elaborate the proposed DSS end user terminal components and capabilities and the advantages it provides to the deployed warfighter.

AB  - Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are replication-deficient parvoviruses, which have traditionally required co-infection with a helper adenovirus or herpes virus for productive infection. The AAV Helper-Free System allows the production of infectious recombinant human adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV-2) virions without the use of a helper virus. The AAV Helper-Free System takes advantage of the identification of the specific adenovirus gene products that mediate AAV replication and the demonstration that these gene products can be introduced into the host cell by transfection.1 In the AAV Helper-Free System, most of the adenovirus gene products required for the production of infective AAV particles are supplied on the plasmid pHelper (i.e. E2A, E4, and VA RNA genes) that is co-transfected into cells with human AAV-2 vector DNA. The remaining adenoviral gene product is supplied by the AAV-293 host cells, which stably express the adenovirus E1 gene.2 The AAV Helper-Free System includes AAV-293 cells, which are HEK293-derived cells with improved adeno-associated virus production capabilities. By eliminating the requirement for live helper virus the AAV Helper-Free System provides a safer, purer and more convenient alternative to retroviral and adenoviral gene delivery systems.

In this paper we present a (customizable) tool, able to compute in real-time the most important connectivity properties of a network, modeled as an undirected graph: connected and biconnected components, articulation points and bridges. The algorithm underlying the tool has been theoretically analyzed in the (semi-)streaming model, and has been tested with graphs up to hundreds of millions nodes and billions edges. The tool, therefore, can be employed to monitor traffic flows in medium and large networks, at real-time, and detect possible anomalies. As an application, we provide results about the structural properties of ten years of samples of the Autonomous System network, obtained from the Univ. of Oregon Route Views project [1], that (once again) shows the ubiquitous presence of power-law distribution.

We also consider that circulating HSP60 and the quantities and specificities of serum antibodies to HSP60 provide a biomarker to monitor the immune status of the individual. Thus, the dual role of HSP60 as an immune modulator and a biomarker, provides an opportunity to modulate immunity for therapeutic purposes, and to monitor the immune response in health and disease. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Harmonics in HVDC power systems caused by highly non-linear devices affect its performance. Controlling and eliminating such harmonics have been a great concern of power engineers in power system design and operation. The HVDC power system harmonic analysis is, therefore, essential in power system planning, control, and operation. The two main mathematical approaches in power system harmonic study are the time-domain analysis and the frequency-domain solution. The former is suitable for studying phenomena including non- linearity, switching operations, long-time simulations, and control systems. The latter, on the other hand, is appropriate for studying phenomena such as frequency dependence, system equivalents, and frequency response. This paper discusses the time and frequency domain methods in the HVDC power system harmonic analysis. It reviews the sources of HVDC system harmonics. The paper also reveals the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and points out their suitable applications in power network harmonic computations.

In this paper, Multi Agent Controller (MAC) has been proposed to maintain the system operational criterions such as the maintenance of voltage and other parameters. This has been implemented in two area network to demonstrate the application of MAC where it maintains the continuity of power in the area subjected to fault. MAC is implemented by using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Simulation is carried out in Mat lab environment. Macsimjx has been used to interface the simulink model with Multi Agent System (MAS). Detailed simulation has been carried out during various fault conditions. The results demonstrate the continuity of power supply to the critical loads through Distributed Energy Resource (DER) even in absence of Grid power.

AB  - For the past 20 years, researches using the lens of world system theory (and other global political economy perspectives) have come to a better understanding of many of the anomalies in urbanisation patterns across more and less developed countries that had befuddled researchers whose assumptions left out global sources of social change. Recently this line of research has moved beyond regarding cities as mere objects of global forces, also theorising about their importance as lynchpins in the spatial organisation of the world economy. In this paper we review some of the scholarship that emphasises large cities’ roles as important modes of production, consumption, exchange and control at the global level; we develop the argument that systematic linkages - economic, cultural, political or social-relational - among global cities are likely to reveal the spatial organisation of the world-system; we review our position that formal network analysis provides a most promising methodological framework for analysing and mapping global intercity linkages; and we present a map of the current world city system based on our network analysis of recent air travel among many of the world’s great cities. We point out that our analysis is very preliminary and provides only a rough chart of the world city system at one point in time, and the data requirements for more detailed world city system maps for several periods of time are imposing, to say the least. Nevertheless, such a project holds the promise of revealing much about the spatial structure of our world system, how it has changed; how it is likely to change in the future; and how cities’ populations are affected by these changes. Completing the project will probably require collaboration among researchers in different countries.

AB  - The paper argues that systems analysis provides an invaluable frame for many aspects of urban studies. Two uses of the systems approach are identified. First, there is the use of the approach to conceptualize the phenomenon of study such that the researcher's emphasis is on the nature of the interrelationships of the objects and the attributes of the system of interest on the one hand, and the study of subsystems of interest within an interacting whole, on the other. Secondly, there is the use of the systems approach to generate appropriate methodological tools for the analysis and description of urban spatial and functional structure. For these uses of the system approach, the concept of entropy, introduced from both thermodynamics and information theory, plays a significant role. Empirically, the concept is used to generate interaction patterns of the journey to work subsystem in Jos, Benue Plateau State, Nigeria, while certain indices of information theory entropy are used to unravel the nature and structure of these flows or movements of people. It emerges that the concept of entropy can be used in studies of urban spatial structure as an integrating concept provided that our terms are defined explicitly and unambiguously. © 1976.

methods, incremental load flow approach (ILFA) and marginal transmission

share of transmission loss in a fully deregulated power system. ILFA is
very simple and employs the load flow technique in an iterative way.
MTLA is basically a mathematical modeling of the transmission losses
based on Kron's loss formula in a fully deregulated network. It
calculates marginal increase in transmission loss due to an increase in
load. These methods along with some numerical results have been

concept to sequential control, by determining control sequences of
sequential control plants that can be modeled by a sub-class of Petri
nets with modular modeling characteristics, defined as PI*-net. The
determination of control sequences of a sequential control plant modeled
by Petri nets is equivalent to the determination of firing sequences of
these models. We propose an approach for finding firing sequences based
on the immune system response mechanism, which differs substantially
from conventional enumerative methods. The firing sequence problem is
reformulated by decomposing it into several smaller sub-problems, the
model itself is divided into several sub-models and local firing
sequences that will compose the original model firing sequence are
selected by interacting common transitions of these sub-models, through
local objective functions. Local objective functions are set dynamically
by internal and inter sub-problems interactions, based on the immune

AB  - Tele-care system has been regarded as one of important industry in the future. This study tends to integrate many functions in long-distance care system through the Web services. For instance, integrating wireless measuring instruments and information systems helps patients in hospitals or at home to have access to complete care. When patients rest at home or do activities outside, measuring instruments may monitor their basic physiological status through the wireless transmission equipment. If an exception occurs, measuring instruments may issue a warning signal to remind, or inform the relatives and friends and even health care centers through Internet automatically in order to save time. Moreover, when patients have to get in hospitals or process online interview, doctors may use the daily recorders to identify or discuss. This study uses physiological monitoring chips to measure status; now the chip can measure body temperatures, respirations and ECG physiological information. The final studies have shown questions of the hidden nodes, exposed nodes and access points. To simulate the experiment, this experiment used NS2 (Network Simulator Version 2) simulation software. As a result, the performance of network service nodes will be affected by the mode of nodes-operation.

AB  -  We investigate the dynamic performance of optical gain clamped (OGC) amplifiers. Analyses are based on a new model we have recently proposed to satisfy EDFA and system designer needs. The model allows, for the first time, easy investigation of both Er-Yb doped amplifiers and high-concentration EDFAs where the upconversion process plays a fundamental role. In addition, we calculate and show the transfer function that relates output signal dynamic to amplifier perturbation arising not only from channel add/drop, but also from pump power fluctuation. This allows optimum electronic circuit design and implementation of electronic feedback. The impact on a metro system of next-generation components, such as waveguide amplifiers, is reported. An experimental investigation of Er-(Yb) doped amplifiers has been performed and system experiments in a multiwavelength metro network are reported.

AB  - As the demand for mobile communication services still increases, not\nonly new and enhanced radio interface technologies are required, but\nalso tools to support the operators with the capabilities for an\nefficient network planning and optimization process. Over the last years\nit turned out that these tools must consider more and more system\naspects since pure modeling of the radio channel is no longer\nsufficient. Three different simulation approaches for evaluating the\nperformance of WCDMA based 3G networks in terms of capacity and service\ncoverage are presented in this article. The basic ideas and the\nrespective output facilities of a static system analysis, a Monte-Carlo\nbased method, and a full dynamic system simulation are presented and the\ncorresponding models are explained. While static simulations may be\nsuited well for a fast roll-out planning in larger areas with several\nhundreds of cells full dynamic network simulations, on the other hand,\nmay be applied to analyze smaller parts of an existing network in a\ndetailed manner considering also user experienced quality of service\naspects. All approaches can work with different propagation models to\ndetermine the radio channel characteristics depending on the existing\nenvironment.

AB  - Sine wave distortions on power systems are shown to affect the performance of both electromechanical protective relays of classical designs and static relays of various designs. Digital based (computer) relay systems do not circumvent, per se, wave distortion problems. Protection relays are shown to not respond to any single parameter such as the rms value or the fundamental component, of an applied signal. It is noted that there are no wave distortion performance standards nor waveform testing standards for protective relays, other than for harmonic restraint relays. This can be attributed to the lack of recognizing as a significant factor the causal relationship between relay performance and waveform distortion. This is an interim report constituting about 20 percent of a contemplated special report, "Sine Wave Distortions on Power Systems and the Impact on, Protective Relaying".

AB  - Symmetry in antibody plus complement mediated killing between a T15 idiotype-bearing monoclonal antibody (HPC-M2) and an anti-T15 monoclonal antibody (B36-82) is demonstrated. The HPC-M2 antibody is also shown to be multispecific in its effector function, since it lyses both phosphorylcholine coated erythrocytes, and B36-82 Fab coated red blood cells. The symmetry and multispecificity in effector function are presented as new evidence against the concept that the paratope of antibody molecule exists as a uniquely defined site on the antibody variable region. A theoretical consequence for immune system network theory is that the anti-idiotypic set and the internal image are functionally equivalent, the results support symmetric network models of regulation, and are evidence against asymmetric models.

AB  - The deterministic and restricted nature of industrial control system networks sets them apart from more open networks, such as local area networks in office environments. This improves the usability of network security, monitoring approaches that would be less feasible in more open environments. One of such approaches is machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of the industrial control system network environment, many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. A machine learning based approach could reduce the amount of manual customization required for different industrial control system networks. In this paper we analyze a possible set of features to be used in a machine learning based anomaly detection system in the real world industrial control system network environment under investigation. The network under investigation is represented by architectural drawing and results derived from network trace analysis. The network trace is captured from a live running industrial process control network and includes both control data and the data flowing between the control network and the office network. We limit the investigation to the IP traffic in the traces.

AB  -  This paper combines the theory of decomposition and coordination with improved tabu search (TS) technique and applies them to reactive power planning in area power systems. Based on the theory of decomposition and coordination, the complex problem is decomposed into several sub-problems under different load conditions. Each sub-problem is solved by the tabu search which is a heuristic optimal technique characterized by avoiding local optimal solutions in high probability. Sensitivity analysis and expert knowledge are used to aid the initial solution generation and improve the search process. Compared with the conventional single load condition and stochastic search method, the proposed algorithms make the complex optimization feasible and can find optimal solutions effectively. Such advantages are demonstrated through the Jinan area power system with 137 buses and 162 transmission lines in Shandong province of China.

AB  - The fuse is the most common and widely used protective device in electrical circuits. Though the “fuseless” concept has been catching on for quite some time, quite a lot of low voltage distribution circuits are protected with fuses. Fuses form a major backup protection in medium-voltage and high-voltage distributions up to 11 kV where switches and contactors with limited short-circuit capacities are used. All fuses irrespective of the type have inverse characteristics. Inverse means that the fuses can withstand their nominal current rating almost indefinitely but as the current increases, their withstanding time starts decreasing making them “blow.” The blowing time decreases as the flowing currents increase. The fuses blow in case the currents flowing through them last for more than their withstand time. This property limits the use of fuses in circuits where the inrush currents are quite high. Hence it is not possible to use fuses as overload protection in such circuits, because it may be necessary to select higher-rated fuse to withstand inrush currents. Accordingly the fuses are mostly used as short-circuit protection rather than as overload protection in such circuits.

AB  - Power system automations technologies are essential for power system operations and controls. A variety of communication systems including optical fiber, microwave and power line communications are used to transmit these EMS/SCADA data. In these communication modes, fiber communication is used to transmit IEC 101/104 protocol data in most power grids due to its large bandwidth and high reliability. However, fiber is very fragile when large natural disasters happen. Earthquake, snow-ice strike, hurricane would probably destroy the infrastructures of the fiber systems. In some tough geographical areas such as mountainous West Sichuan Plateaus, the construction and operation of fiber communications are very costly and difficult. After 2008 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake Sichuan Electric Power Corporations started to investigate some alternative communication systems against natural disasters. Compared to traditional fiber communications, VSAT communication (Very Small Aperture Terminal for satellite communications) has 3 advantages: (1) The setup of a VSAT station is convenient and flexible. (2) The VSAT system is robust against natural disasters since it does not need wired cable or fiber. (3) The setup and operation of VSAT system is cost effective in some tough geographic areas. In Sichuan Power, we proposed an new data networks for EMS/SCADA data transmission based on VSAT systems. The structure of our system is a star-like topology: we place the VSAT communication terminals to some substations and power plants in areas which cannot afford fiber infrastructures economically or geographically. A central VSAT station is set on Power Dispatching Center. All data in VSAT system are based on TCP/IP protocol. The first problem for such a system is to select suitable VSAT communication modalities. We chose SCPC (Single Carrier per Channel) over TDMA (Time-Division Multiplex Access) as our favorable modality because SCPC could provide reliable and persistent data link and easy to-
-
 manage. A detailed analysis will be included in full text. For IEC 101 protocol, the traditional 2M channel is transferred to IP packets to access the VSAT system. For IEC 104 protocol, data is directly accessed to VAST system through Ethernet connections. Since the satellite link is not stable due to a variety of environmental reasons, traditional TCP may have large transmission delay or even cannot be used in such environments. To meet the requirements of IEC protocols in transmission delay, we developed a TCP/IP accelerator dedicated for satellite communication based on SCPS-TP (Space Communication Protocol Standards - Transport Protocol). The SCPS-TP is modified version of traditional TCP/IP protocol adapted to space communications and it considers the effects of packet loss due to satellite link outage. A SCPS-TP based TCP/IP accelerator is added to each VSAT terminal in order to minimize the transmission delay. Our experiences showed that such VSAT system a very useful and robust in power systems against disasters.

AB  - China's urbanization has accelerated during the era of reform. While there has been real progress in urbanization, the process has also been skewed by several administrative measures designed to foster urbanization and economic growth. According to a popular view, as many as 70 per cent of China's administrative jurisdictions now come under the rule of urban governments. This must be an exaggeration given that many parts of China are still essentially rural. This article examines three measures - turning prefectures into cities (di gai shi), turning counties into cities (xian gai shi), and turning cities and counties into urban districts (xian shi gai qu) - that have contributed to "inflated urbanization." Five propositions budgetary, urbanization, regulatory, organizational streamlining and policy incentive - are discussed to see if the three measures have either originated from or have affected them. We find that while the regulatory observation is relevant only for the measure of xian shi gai qu, the other four propositions are useful, though to varying degrees, for understanding the logic of the changing "city system" in the past two decades.

According to the system performance a proper design for the Power System Stabilizer (PSS) using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is carried out. Then the designed PSS is implemented in the model and the dynamic system response is analyzed. Since the simulation results without PSS showed unacceptable system response, the system response with the PSS has improved and the PSS succeeded to stabilize an unstable system. The designed PSS has been implemented in a microcontroller. Finally, the system response with PSS-microcontroller has been tested and compared with the simulation results.

The radiologists had decided to conduct biopsy by selecting an equal number of positive and negative cases for the test group; thus the radiologists' performance with respect to categories of benign versus malignant was constrained to be 50/50. Statistical analysis shows only a 2% probability that the observed accuracy of 72% was a chance performance in recognizing whether a cluster is benign or malignant.

AB  - Harmonic and interharmonic distortion has become a main concern in electric distribution systems. Different types of harmonic and interharmonic sources exist in power system e.g. thyristor bridges, arc furnaces, cycloconverters and saturable magnetic devices. High harmonic voltages can be problematic to various sensitive equipments. Various harmonic surveys are conducted by various utilities and R&amp;amp;D organizations across the world to identify the level of harmonic distortion. National and international standards are implemented in various countries to limit the harmonic distortion. Interharmonics can be found in networks of all voltage classes and can cause temperature rise and torques in induction motors and flicker in lighting equipment. The problem with various available standards is that they are not treating the problem of interharmonics. No significant work on survey of interharmonics present in power system network has been reported. In this paper a summary of results of survey of interharmonics conducted in Indian power system network is presented. Interharmonic survey is conducted at 0.415 KV, 11 KV, 33KV, 132 KV and 220 KV networks feeding power to various categories of customers. The aim of the work is to identify the level of inter-harmonics in the various supply system feeding power to various categories of customers. The measurement and analysis is performed by using advanced power quality analyzer. According to the voltage and current inter-harmonic levels present in various supply systems , the effects of inter-harmonics on the system and solutions are discussed. Result of this survey will help to understand the existing level of interharmonic in voltage and current and need to address interharmonic issue in harmonic standards.

The multi-agent system consists of several facilitator agents, equipment agents, and switch-box agents. A facilitator agent acts as a manager for negotiation process between agents. An equipment agent corresponds to the element of the electric power system, such as bus, transformer, and transmission line, while switch-box agent is the pseudo object which consists of neighboring current breakers and disconnecting switches. The proposed approach is applied to a simple network and a practical-size network, and the results show that the proposed multi-agent system approach is an efficient decentralized approach for solving power system normal operations

AB  -  Power system stabilizers (PSS) are used to generate supplementary control signals for the excitation system in order to damp the low frequency power system oscillations. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional PSS (CPSS), numerous techniques have been proposed in the literature. Based on the analysis of existing techniques, this paper presents an indirect adaptive neural network based power system stabilizer (IDNC) design. The proposed IDNC consists of a neuro-controller, which is used to generate a supplementary control signal to the excitation system, and a neuro-identifier, which is used to model the dynamics of the power system and to adapt the neuro-controller parameters. The proposed method has the features of a simple structure, adaptivity and fast response. The proposed IDNC is evaluated on a single machine infinite bus power system under different operating conditions and disturbances to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

AB  - The rapid development of information technology (IT) is pushing
the power system information network to a remarkable innovation state.
Internet/Intranet will play an important role in power system
information network. This paper reviews the current Internet
applications in power systems in areas such as remote information
access, geographic information systems (GIS), SCADA/EMS, condition
monitoring and predictive maintenance, customers service, power market,
power quality, and distance education/training. Though the application
of the Internet has been developed in many areas, scattered and
individual applications hampered the large-scale integration of power
system information source. Some preliminary thoughts on a future
Internet based power system information network (PSIN) architecture are
presented. The paper draws a blueprint for future PSIN infrastructure
development

AB  -  We are developing a virtual city system with a model that consists of virtual architectural objects and virtual creatures, geographically overlaid onto the real world. People who have mobile terminals with location sensors like GPS can visit the virtual city when walking about in a real city. The most important aspect of our research is that we have adopted current market mobile phones. In this paper we describe a prototype of virtual city system and its evaluation. The result of evaluation suggests that subjects were very much interested in the virtual city system. Technical problems have been revealed by the evaluation but most of them will be solved or minimized if we use the next generation of mobile phones.

AB  - While there has been progress towards pandemic preparedness in recent years, continued vigilance and investments are critical for global health security, people’s livelihoods and economic development. There have been three major epidemiological events in the first decade of this century: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. They demonstrate that we face continuing threats of pandemic influenza and other infectious diseases. The risk would appear to be increasing. Pandemics of both known and – as yet – unknown infectious diseases threaten people and economies of all countries. Developing countries are likely to be the hardest hit. There have been intense efforts to address H5N1 HPAI since the early outbreaks of disease in poultry in 2003. They have resulted in significant reductions in the number of countries affected since 2006. This trend could easily be reversed if focus is not maintained and resources are not allocated as part of the routine business of ministries of health and agriculture. There are three priorities. First – continued joint working by governments, communities and industry, both for multi-hazard disaster preparedness and for bio-secure animal rearing. Joint efforts are needed to prevent and control H5N1 HPAI, to ensure that control and response systems tackle a broad range of emerging and existing disease threats and to improve coordination between animal, human and environmental health disciplines. This One Health approach is necessary to ensure that countries are ready to detect, assess and respond to pandemics. Second – long-term investments in animal and human health. Experience from the global responses to SARS, H5N1 HPAI, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 provide lessons for the future, moving away from emergency measures to longer term sustained disease prevention, the development of capacities to respond to incursions and, where appropriate, to eradicate disease. There will always be a need for improvement in the forecasting and monitoring of disease emergence, spread and potential impact. This will aid the management of risks and consequences, and lead to better capacity for tackling problems at source before they become regional, continental or global threats. The One Health approach will greatly facilitate development of these capacities. Third – well-functioning animal and human health delivery systems. Effective responses to animal and pandemic influenza are best implemented locally. Therefore, all countries should aim to have strong, practical and predictable delivery systems for animal and human health, including emergency and contingency planning systems that reflect global standards and legal frameworks such as the OIE veterinary standards and the WHO International Health Regulations. World leaders at the International Ministerial Conference on Animal and Pandemic Influenza (IMCAPI) 2010 indicated their political support for these priorities through The ‘Hanoi Declaration’ and backing for the ‘Framework for Sustaining Momentum’ – two documents that feature prominently within this report.
