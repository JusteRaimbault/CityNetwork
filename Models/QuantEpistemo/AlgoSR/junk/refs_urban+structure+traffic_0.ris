AB  - This article studies determinants of some aspects of the structure of cities, including density and the price of land and housing. We use a version of the Alonso-Muth-Mills model, calibrated to broadly match some of the features of a representative large city. Although the calibrated model omits many real-world features, it can nonetheless be used to explore the impact of factors such as: (i) the provision of transport infrastructure; (ii) zoning policies that limit housing density; (iii) frictions on the production of housing; and (iv) population size. The empirical section of the article shows that the model is consistent with some empirical regularities for large Australian cities. The results of the article draw attention to structural factors that may have contributed to developments in the Australian housing market in recent years.

AB  - This paper examines the structural effects of colonization on city-size distribution in Bangladesh. It also explores how development policies of indepenent Bangladesh impacted subsequent patterns and trends of urbanization in the country. The urban structure is analyzed using rank-size plots, a rank- size regression model, and a rank-mobility index. The historical analysis of city rank-size relationships reveals the structural effect of the policies of the British to concentrate urban functions in few urban centers, the Pakistani period of primate-city development, and the deconcentration policies of the Bangladeshi period. The top few cities continue to dominate, irrespective of Bangladesh's government plan to reverse development polarization caused by urban primacy.

AB  - Representative driving cycles across the Perth, Western Australia, metropolitan region illustrate a direct relationship to urban land use. Movement away from the central business district results in fewer traffic events, higher speeds longer cruise periods and shorter stops. The consequent reduction in root mean square acceleration leads to a corresponding reduction in vehicle emission factors. Urban planning implications are persued and highlight the importance of public transport as an option in reducing urban air pollution.

AB  - By integrating environmental traffic capacity (ETC) with traffic structure optimization (TSO) on urban road, influencing factors of ETC were analyzed, and the concept of TSO was introduced. Based on functional relationship between emission factors and vehicular speed, and the regression model of vehicular speed and traffic volume, a relation between traffic volume and traffic pollutants diffusion concentration was set up. A multi-objective optimization model, whose objectives were the maximum of traffic volume and traffic efficiency, was developed and its main constraints were the traffic capacity and the control concentration of pollutants in air quality standard, and then its solving algorithm was designed. The practical example study shows that there are different ETC values according to different environment air quality evaluation factors and the reasonable traffic structure is not only beneficial to improving road traffic efficiency, and also favorable to protecting environment air quality.

AB  - This paper focuses on the way urban dynamic processes challenge existing monitoring approaches and how Urban Structure Types (UST) support an effective urban management. Due to their microstructure and the instability of shape, the differentiation of settlement structures is substantially difficult. Hence, highly sophisticated data such as color infrared (CIR) ortho-photos as well as methods of image analysis, e.g. segmentation of objects will be employed. It will be shown how an object-oriented analysis strategy with CIR aerial photographs can be used to detect and discriminate different urban structure types by describing typical characteristics of color, texture, shape and context. The urban structure classification is characterized by identifying different types of buildings (different types of housing, industrial buildings, infrastructure) and open spaces (woodland, allotments, parks), their structural composition in terms of the amount, connectivity, and distribution of impervious surfaces, green spaces, and other open spaces on an aggregated neighborhood scale. This paper contributes to a transferable methodology to monitor the urban dynamics and structure on a local level.

AB  - Four hundred years of developing, shifting and changing marks the city of Dhaka with a strong culture heritage. Traditional hierarchies and organic spatial structures form a rich mix of indigenous morphology, which is obvious in historically famous and organically developed bazaar streets and commercial interfaces. The urban development of Dhaka city is well known for its spatial structure. A 'space syntax' technique is used to understand the structure, function, underlying logic, morphological growth and evolution of the urban systems. This article focuses on both the spatial dynamics of the urban structure and on the spatial nature of the bazaar streets (commercial networks) and aims to explicate the notion of the configurational analysis of urban growth. By determining the syntactic pattern and evolution of the bazaar streets, this analysis can be usefully applied to designing for future urban growth.

AB  - Urban structure types (UST) are an initial interest and basic instrument for monitoring, controlling and modeling tasks of urban planners and decision makers during ongoing urbanization processes. This study focuses on a method to classify UST from land cover (LC) objects, which were derived from high resolution satellite images. The topology of urban LC objects is analyzed by implementing neighborhood LC-graphs. Various graph measures are examined by their potential to distinguish between different UST, using the machine learning classifier random forest. Additionally the influence of different parameter settings of the random forest model, the reduction of training samples, and the graph measure importance is analyzed. An independent test set is classified and validated, achieving an overall accuracy of 87%. It was found that the height of the building with the highest node degree has a strong impact on the classification result.

AB  - Full article: Bangkok, Thailand, 16th May 2012—Thai police have seized the carcasses of two Tigers, a Leopard and a Golden Cat from a house in Khan Na Yao, in Bangkok today.  Officers from the Crime Suppression Division and the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police have arrested a Thai man and a Vietnamese man in connection with the crime. All three species are protected in Thailand, and are all listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The animals, found chopped up and stuffed into a freezer in the house, were believed to have been sourced from Malaysia and moved through Sadao, a district in the southern Thai province of Songkla, which shares a border with Malaysia.  Initial investigations have shown the animals were bound for China via Nong Khai, a town near the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.   From Nong Khai, the animals were to be transported across the Mekong River to Lao PDR before being moved to China.  Police said the suspects were paid 8,000 Baht (USD250) to transport the animals from the south of Thailand to Bangkok.  The seized animals have been handed over to the Wildlife First Aid Clinic where samples will be taken for DNA analysis.  “Any DNA analysis should be undertaken with an eye toward establishing the origins of these animals. Going forward, it will be important to know exactly where they came from.” noted TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director, Dr. William Schaedla.  “We also hope the Thai authorities will undertake a thorough investigation of the transport routes being utilized by the smugglers and co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighboring countries. Simply seizing dead animals will not be enough to prevent future losses of tigers and other endangered animals to wildlife trafficking.”  For further images of the haul, please contact Richard Thomas, +44 752 6646216, richard.thomas@traffic.org.

Therefore climate measurement stations are permanently set-up on different land uses, and additionally mobile climate measurements are carried out every year at the same time and similar climate conditions. The study area is Santiago de Chile, one of the most dynamic and fast growing cities in South America. Urban Structure Types (UST) are delineated for areas under investigation in which the urban morphology is rather characteristic for the social strata. UST are compared with climate parameters to find out if significant correlations exist between UST and climate measurements. The overall goal is to estimate environmental justice in large urban agglomerations.

AB  - A recent study in Frederikshavn, Denmark, shows that urban structural variables influence travel behaviour, even in a small town of around 30 000 inhabitants. As might be expected, socio-economic and attitudinal factors play a role in the respondents' travelling patterns. However, when controlling for these factors and a range of other potential explanatory variables, clear relationships are also found between urban structural characteristics and travel activity. These relationships exist across most subgroups of the population. The statistical relationships found between urban structure and travel behaviour are confirmed in qualitative interviews. The distance from the residence to the downtown area is a key factor influencing the accessibility to a number of facilities. These differences in accessibility result in corresponding differences in the actual travelling distances and modal split.

AB  - The phenomenon of Urban Heat Island is shown by an increase in temperature that mostly affects urban areas in comparison with the surrounding rural areas. This increase in temperature becomes problematic during the heat waves when it can give rise to problems of energy and health. The factors affecting this phenomenon are related to the morphology and location of the urban area, to the characteristics of building and roads materials, to the shape of urban structure. The paper investigates the phenomenon of UHI by analyzing in particular the influence of major urban planning features: the average height of buildings, the building density, the coverage ratio, the percentage of impermeable surface. The study was carried out starting from the analysis of a real case within the Province of Naples. The identification of areas liable to heat islands has been done by working out a thermal map of the Province of Naples through the creation of hyper-spectral satellite images using remote sensing techniques. This map has allowed to select some sample areas within which the main urban planning parameters have been detected through remote sensing techniques or spatial analysis. For each parameter, correlation curves "temperature - urban planning parameter" have been worked out. The main result is the development of an abacus that allows to estimate the expected temperature changes according to the decrease or increase of each urban parameter. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The nature and form of the urban environment is a critical determinant of the sustainability of our society, as it is responsible directly for a large proportion of consumed energy, and influences indirectly the patterns and modes of energy consumed in everyday activities. We examine the current state of research into the energy and greenhouse gas emissions attributable directly or indirectly to urban form. Specifically, we look at the embodied (construction) and operational energy attributable to the construction, maintenance and use of residential dwellings, and we review the literature on the relationship between urban structure and private travel behaviour. While there is clear evidence from both intra- and inter-city comparisons that higher density, transit-oriented cities have lower per-capita transport energy use, the effect of housing density on residential (in-house) energy use is less clear.

AB  - Urban structure influences directly or indirectly the majority of all green house gas (GHG) emissions in cities. The prevailing belief is that dense metropolitan areas produce less carbon emissions on a per capita basis than less dense surrounding rural areas. Consequently, density targets have a major role in low-carbon urban developments. However, based on the results of this study, the connection seems unclear or even nonexistent when comprehensive evaluation is made. In this letter, we propose a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) method for calculating the consumption-based carbon footprints in metropolitan areas, i.e. carbon consumption, with the emphasis on urban structures. The method is input–output-based hybrid LCA, which operates with the existing data from the region. The study is conducted by performing an analysis of the carbon consumption in two metropolitan areas in Finland, including 11 cities. Both areas consist of a dense city core and a less dense surrounding suburban area. The paper will illustrate that the influence of urban density on carbon emissions is insignificant in the selected metropolitan areas. In addition, the utilized consumption-based method links the climate effects of city-level development to the global production of emissions.

(4) The general term "assimilation" should not be used; rather the focus should be on degrees of equality or dissimilar ity in specific areas: educ, occup, income, & housing.

AB  - In this paper, an analysis is made of the evolution of Spanish urban structure during the period 1900-99. It is postulated that the size distribution of the cities follows a Pareto distribution, which is estimated on a yearly basis. At the same time, the hypothesis is adopted that the intradistribution dynamics can be modelled by means of a Markov chain. In this way, are deduced the so-called transition matrix and its associated vector or ergodic probabilities. This methodology allows two main results to be obtained. First, this evolution has not been homogeneous ; there has been a divergent pattern of growth during the period 1900-70; and a convergent pattern for the period 1970-99. Secondly, the intradistribution movements in the Spanish urban hierarchy have been very significant during the course of the 20th century. In addition, the existence of spatial correlation has also been detected for those cities that have either entered or exited from the sample of the 100 largest cities during the course of the century. 10.1080/0042098032000053923

We study the impact of heterogeneity in tastes on urban structure using the simplest meaningful clone of the standard model: all arguments are presented in the context of a metropolitan area which is partitioned in two homogeneous zones, centre and suburd. Given that individuals have perfect knowledge, heterogeneity in tastes may affect equilibrium in two ways. Namely, individuals may differ with respect to their location decision and, at a particular location, they may differ with respect to how they allocate their initial resources. The strategy adopted here is to study these two effects in isolation.

AB  - Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease globally and is usually associated with built environments in tropical areas. Remotely sensed information can facilitate the study of urban mosquito-borne diseases by providing multiple temporal and spatial resolutions appropriate to investigate urban structure and ecological characteristics associated with infectious disease. In this study, coarse, medium and fine resolution satellite imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and QuickBird respectively) and ground-based data were analyzed for the Greater Puntarenas area, Costa Rica for the years 2002-04. The results showed that the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generally higher in the localities with lower incidence of dengue fever during 2002, although the correlation was statistically significant only in the dry season (r=-0.40; p=0.03). Dengue incidence was inversely correlated to built area and directly correlated with tree cover (r=0.75, p=0.01). Overall, the significant correlations between dengue incidence and urban structural variables (tree cover and building density) suggest that properties of urban structure may be associated with dengue incidence in tropical urban settings.

In the growth of urban structure these register the decisive practices of the social agents (factions of capital, the state, including all its levels, and labor) - whose actions create the city and define its identity. The above assertions are illustrated by an historical analysis of the social production of space in Mazatlan, a city that could have been just like any other in the industrialized world, but that today presents the characteristics of a Third World place as a result of the weak development of its productive forces, but especially of the way state intervention brought resources to the area only to have them exploited by elements of private capital, including foreign extractive sources. © SAGE Publications 2011.

It has office, business and residential functions. Both the Buda and the Pest sides have large outer residential belts both of villa and housing estate types, and belts of mixed functions. Finally the recent problems of the large housing developments sited on the outskirts of the town are introduced. Some of them are the neglect of the inner residential areas, the functions and centres in the large satellite housing estates, transportation problems.

AB  - Llrban structure may be viewed as an abstract or generalized description of the distribution of phenomena in urban geographic space. The concept incorporates such ideas as pattern, distance, morphology, and relative location. Description of spatialI elements-linear features, nodes, and surfaces within urban areas-is but one facet considered in the study of urban structure, however. Explanation and prediction also form important, if not crucial, steps in understanding structural and behavioral changes in the urban system over time. Several methodological approaches have been utilized by urban researchers to achieve explanation and prediction; this study adopts the behavioral approach, defined as &dquo;an attempt to derive a set of empirically valid statements about individual, group, or mass behavior which can form postulates in a theory yielding statements of spatial structure as logical outputs&dquo; (Horton and Reynolds, 1971: 36). This paper takes the view that criminal mobility is related to urban structure and that the analysis of movement behavior will yield insight into offender decision-making and spatial preferences and contribute significantly to our understanding of the urban system as a crime opportunity structure. Robbery offenders are treated as the actors at varying geographical locations who, with a certain amount of information concerning the location of criminal opportunities in urban space, undergo a decision-making process that eventually leads to specific kinds of spatial behavioral biases. Specifically, the paper has three main objectives: ( I ) to describe the distance biases of robbery offenders in metropolitan Miami, (2) to offer explanations of these biases by examining certain concepts of individual behavior as they relate to movement within Miami’s urban system, and (3) to outline the authors’ ongoing research within the area of criminal mobility.

AB  - Location-based assessments of accessibility gauge the attraction of a place relative to other places. These approaches have been used extensively in models of commuting and urban structure. Even though locational accessibility measures are integral to such efforts, they may also be used to explore aspects of urban spatial structure. As such, this paper presents a GIS-based analysis of locational accessibility for a sample of U.S. metropolitan areas. Indices of accessibility based on spatial interaction models are developed for intraurban residential and employment locations. Results show that residential accessibility patterns are similar across cities, taking a concentric pattern where the central urban area is most attractive. However, employment accessibility varies more from city to city; moreover, the areas of highest employment accessibility tend to be decentralized within their respective regions. Overall, location-based accessibility indices are useful for exploring urban form, particularly with respect to issues of urban sprawl. Directions for future research are identified, including linking comparative urban accessibility measures to ongoing work on commuting, the jobs-housing balance, and urban structure.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure. Improvements in ICT may lead to changes in urban structure, for example, because they reduce the costs of communicating ideas from a distance. Hence, they may weaken local agglomeration forces and thus provide incentives for economic activity to relocate to smaller urban centres. We use international data on city size distributions in different countries and on country-level characteristics to test the effect of ICT. We find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita encourage the spatial dispersion of population in that they lead to a more concentrated distribution of city sizes. So far the evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. We argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban structures once its use has spread more thoroughly through different economies.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - During heat waves the death rate from heat-related ailments is often much higher in cities than in outlying environs. The higher death rate in cities appears to be a result of climate modification due to urbanization. Daytime urban-rural climatic differences are small. Nighttime urban-rural climatic differences, however, are often significant—air temperature is warmer within cities at night, long-wave radiant heat load is greater, wind speed is often lower, and inside air temperature of characteristic urban buildings is warmer. Noeturnal urban heat islands of 4–7° are shown to be associated with heat waves in two cities. During heat waves inhabitants of urban areas may experience sustained thermal stresses both day and night while inhabitants of the outlying environs often obtain some relief from thermal stresses during nocturnal hours. It is suggested that excess deaths occurring in urban areas during periods of extreme heat can be significantly reduced through appropriate urban land use.

AB  - Full article: UK, 18th March 2013 - As part of the response to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) the UK government has announced it will not commit to long-term financial support for the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) beyond 2013-14. This team plays a vital role in preventing wildlife crime here in the UK, and is also a contributor in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.  Commenting, Heather Sohl, species expert for WWF-UK said: "This is highly disappointing news, especially after the UK has fought hard towards an end to international wildlife trafficking at the CITES meeting over the last two weeks.[1] When the world is recognising illegal wildlife trade as a serious crime and looking for government commitments to end the trade, the UK should be stepping up its efforts to address these crimes within our own borders. The recommendations of the Committee are reasonable and would have achieved this, but the government is avoiding a long-term commitment to tackling wildlife crime."  The Government also rejected recommendations to tighten up the recording of wildlife crime data to help keep track and tackle trends in wildlife crime. Stephanie Pendry, Enforcement Programme Leader at TRAFFIC, who has worked as part of the unit, said: "I have witnessed first-hand the vital role that this unit plays. In the case of illegal wildlife trade, culprits are often part of wider criminal networks that operate across borders, and cracking down on such trade takes time and joint effort. It is precisely this time that the Unit have not been afforded by the Government, which is a real shame and will have a knock-on effect on operations to protect wildlife."  WWF and TRAFFIC gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) early last year and this was reflected in the October 2012 report on wildlife crime in the UK. It suggested that enforcement of wildlife crime in the UK is suffering due to the short term availability of funds, a lack of proper training and guidance over prosecutions, and unnecessarily complex legislation.[2]  UK prosecutors and judiciary must be aware of the serious nature of these crimes and how to handle them appropriately. Available penalties are not applied rigorously enough to reflect the nature of illegal wildlife trade crimes, so fail to act as a strong deterrent for future offences. Specialist wildlife crime training for generalist prosecutors and sentencing guidelines for the judiciary are needed.  The creation of specific wildlife crime codes have been rejected by the Home Office, but without the ability to record wildlife crime levels it is impossible to show the impact of such crime, and what trends are occurring, both over time and regionally. It is hard to justify more resources when it is not possible to demonstrate the true size and trends of the problem. If codes are not the answer, WWF and TRAFFIC urge the government to demonstrate an appropriate, alternative way to capture the information on crimes so desperately needed using existing systems.  Many of the EAC recommendations are also reflected in their inquiry from 2004. WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the Government to reconsider how it can take appropriate actions to address wildlife crime.

Considerable attention has been devoted to understanding where and how residential location affects urban activity, yet little of this effort has been directed to work and what determines location choices in cities. This study addresses this question by providing a theory based on modern labor economics, which complements the residential location theory at the core of recent urban studies. It analyzes the importance of workplace location in assessing matters of spatial structure, commuting patterns, underemployment, and the formation of urban ghettoes.

AB  - Basic to several key issues in current urban economic theory and public policy is a presumption that local imbalances between employment and residential sites strongly influence people's commuting patterns. We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of job and housing locations. We find that the amount of commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across job locations only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting.

AB  - Ur spatial structure & class relationships within Ur environments of dependent capitalist social formations contrast strongly with those evidenced in advanced capitalist industrialized nations. A theoretical understanding is proposed of capital accumulation that characterizes core & periphery in the world system. The concepts of "articulated" & "disarticulated" accumulation are used to analyze these alternative processes & to link class formation & class struggle to their objective expressions in the structure of Ur space. The analysis of Ur structure in peripheral social formations must begin with a theory of dependency. The issues over which classes struggle & their capacities to engage in struggle are determined by the constraints on the process of accumulation at a world system level & their differential focus in the international DofL. These processes are themselves mediated by the state & the forms of state intervention. The structurally distinct process of "disarticulated" accumulation in the periphery is used as the basis for a consideration of Ur structure within dependent capitalist nations.

AB  - Due to continuous world-wide urbanization, especially in developing and emerging countries, urban environment represents one of the most dynamic landscapes on earth. The role of human settlements is becoming more and more important in land management, and the various structures of urban areas differ tremendously depending on social and historical backgrounds. So, beyond land-use and land-cover information, it is the urban composition that explains for social disparities, vulnerability to natural hazards, and deficits in urban and regional planning. In this study, first steps are presented towards and urban structural analysis using a multi-sensoral approach. With very high spatial resolution imageries, remote sensing offers techniques well-applicable to measure and monitor intra-urban heterogeneties. Imageries from Quickbird sensor and TerraSAR-X device, Spotlight mode, are taken to delineate field-mapped and well-defined urban structure types (UST). A robust rule base will be built which allows for accurate classifications and interpretation of typical-man-made structures. The most typical structural characteristics of urban regions are alignment and type of buildings, open and green spaces, and transportation network.

AB  - Most economic activity occurs in cities. This creates a tension between local increasing returns, implied by the existence of cities, and aggregate constant returns, implied by balanced growth. To address this tension, we develop a general equilibrium theory of economic growth in an urban environment. In our theory, variation in the urban structure through the growth, birth, and death of cities is the margin that eliminates local increasing returns to yield constant returns to scale in the aggregate. We show that, consistent with the data, the theory produces a city size distribution that is well approximated by Zipf's law, but that also displays the observed systematic underrepresentation of both very small and very large cities. Using our model, we show that the dispersion of city sizes is consistent with the dispersion of productivity shocks found in the data. CR  - Copyright &#169; 2007 The Review of Economic Studies Ltd.

AB  - Dynamics of urban environments are a challenge to a sustainable development. Urban areas promise wealth, realization of individual dreams and power. Hence, many cities are characterized by a population growth as well as physical development. Traditional, visual mapping and updating of urban structure information of cities is a very laborious and cost-intensive task, especially for large urban areas. For this purpose, we developed a workflow for the extraction of the relevant information by means of object-based image classification. In this manner, multisensoral remote sensing data has been analyzed in terms of very high resolution optical satellite imagery together with height information by a digital surface model to retrieve a detailed 3D city model with the relevant land-use land-cover information. This information has been aggregated on the level of the building block to describe the urban structure by physical indicators. A comparison between the indicators derived by the classification and a reference classification has been accomplished to show the correlation between the individual indicators and a reference classification of urban structure types. The indicators have been used to apply a cluster analysis to group the individual blocks into similar clusters.

AB  - Full article: Alor Star, Malaysia, 7th February 2013—A court case involving Malaysia’s biggest ever seizure of trafficked Tiger parts today saw the conviction of a 29-year old man, who was sentenced to a total 60 months in prison. However Mohd Nor Shahrizam Nasir, found guilty on two charges of illegal possession of Tiger parts and one for possession of African Elephant ivory, will only serve 24 months in jail as the judge ordered that his sentences run concurrently. A conviction under the section of the law involving Tiger parts also carries a mandatory fine of "not less than RM100,000 and not more than RM500,000 and a jail term not exceeding five years.” However, the court did not issue the mandatory fine. In February last year, he was arrested at this home where Wildlife Department officers found eight Tiger skins, 22 bags of Tiger skulls and bones and nine African Elephant tusks.  Mohd Nor Shahrizam, from the town of Alor Star in northern Peninsular Malaysia claimed trial to charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010. This morning he was handed down a sentence of 24 months each on the charges of keeping the eight Tiger skins, and the 22 Tiger skulls and bones. He received a further 12-month jail term on the third charge of keeping African Elephant tusks. Judge Mohd Rosli Osman granted the defence a stay pending an appeal and ordered that the convicted man’s bail, initially set at RM70,000, be increased by an additional RM10,000. If Mohd Nor Shahrizam raises bail, he will be free pending his appeal.   TRAFFIC welcomed the conviction but noted its concern that the sentence imposed contradicted the provision of the laws under which Mohd Nor Shahrizam was charged. “This is shocking given that the mandatory fine is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is also disappointing considering it has taken 13 years of hard work and the effort of so many to include a punitive minimum fine for heinous wildlife crimes,” said TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director Dr William Schaedla. TRAFFIC has learnt that the prosecution will seek a revision of the sentence. Schaedla also disagreed with the argument raised by the defence during the trial; that the crime in question was insignificant because it did not involve loss of life. “Such arguments fail to recognize that the arrest in this case was linked to the largest Tiger seizure Malaysia has ever seen – eight skins and the skulls and bones of 22 Tigers were impounded from the culprit’s Alor Star residence,” he said. “It also contradicts recent international developments that are putting wildlife crime on a par with other serious crimes such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking.” “The short jail term and the lack of a fine are a demoralizing finale to what should have been a victory against wildlife crime. We hope the lapse does not crush the spirit of those authorities who are still working hard to protect Malaysia’s 500 remaining Tigers.”

AB  - The aims of this paper are to empirically test and evaluate methods for describing intraurban polycentricity, and to evaluate the polycentric development with respect to the regional development plan of the Office of Urban and Regional Transportation in 2001. The study area is Stockholm County and the time period investigated is 1991-2004. Three dimensions of polycentricity are analyzed: urban nuclei size relations, spatial distribution of urban nuclei, and potential interaction (accessibility). According to the methods' various qualifications in describing polycentric forms it is proposed here that a combination of methods is preferable for this subject. The polycentric structure exposes an increasing and considerable concentration of urban resources to the major urban nuclei. This concentration is combined with an increased spatial dispersal of the urban nuclei. In relative terms, the accessibility has decreased concerning the accessibility by public transportation modes and increased (workspace) or remained on almost the same level (residential space) by car transportation mode. Thus, the urban structural change in the Stockholm region corresponds to the political guidelines. In spite of this, by the increase in relative accessibility by car and decrease in the relative accessibility by public transportation modes the goal concerning higher share in public transports may not be possible to fulfill.

AB  - Urban structure type (UST) mapping is widely used for assessing the ecological situation in the frame of urban planning. A wide range of spatial indicators has been developed for quantitative characterization of USTs. This requires detailed urban surface material inventories. Recent advances in hyperspectral remote sensing allow automated identification of surface materials. In this paper, a multi-stage processing system for flexible calculation of urban land cover indicators is presented and applied to a study area in Munich, Germany. The system uses hyperspectral images and height information and includes the stages (1) preprocessing, (2) hyperspectral surface material mapping, (3) indicator calculation and (4) multi-level validation. In the study area 38 spectrally distinct surface materials have been automatically mapped. They form the basis for the derivation of 7 spatial indicators describing the urban land cover. The mean absolute error for the surface material identification amounts to less than 8% and for indicator calculation the mean errors range between 3 and 11%. The validation has shown the general suitability of the developed approach for analyzing large urban areas. Limitations occur in mapping of surface materials of small urban objects. Further statistical analysis has revealed typical combinations of indicator values for each UST. Finally, the results were compared to indicators estimated by the municipality of Munich, demonstrating that they are comparable to currently available mapping products. The presented study showed the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for efficient and up-to-date derivation of urban land cover indicators for use in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cities are shaped by numerous decisions, yet urban spatial structure and locational decision-making are seldom linked. A principal components typology of land use change isolates four major processes of change: suburbanization, core area renewal, infrastructure growth, and specialized nucleations. These components identify the key decisions and decision agents involved. Comparative analyses of land use change and of site selection by individual developers in Toronto suggest a three-level hierarchy of locational determinants relating to the choice of site, to both site and context, and to factors apparent only at an aggregate level.

AB  - Conventional thinking in urban remote sensing is to synchronize the dates of when satellite imagery is captured with the date a social survey, such as a population census, is collected. It's assumed that identical dates, or dates as similar as possible, are intuitively important in order to make sure that structure, the physical configuration of a city as captured by remote sensing, relates as closely as possible to function, the socio-economic characteristics of a city, as represented by population censuses. However, this type of intuitive thinking is surely flawed because the structure of a city is hardly ever in harmony with the functionality of a city, at the same time. It is much more realistic to assume that there is a temporal lag between the socio-economic demands from a city's population and the consequential physical ramifications of such demands. In other words, the tangible layout of a city, i.e. roads, houses, etc, is a result of prior decisions made by planners with respect to demands from the city's population. This paper explores this temporal lag between structure and function by comparing the physical structure of cities from satellite images at T+1 with the functionality of the socio-economic characteristics from a population census in T-1. Initial results suggest an improved ldquoagreementrdquo between satellite images taken after a population census, in terms of predicting population growth and predicting residential demands. Further testing is needed in order to establish a theoretical link that can be used by planners in deciding where to develop cities, how sustainable such increased development can be contained and how best to reduce overcrowding, congestion and overall social deprivation.

AB  - The influence of the scale and diversity of municipal government and of community-wide voluntary associations on the formation of hospital councils was examined in 130 of the largest cities in the United States. These two variables, together with other organizational variables that describe communities accounted for the main part of the explained variance in the formation of hospital councils. They also accounted (1) for the relationship observed here and in other studies between how a community organizes itself for health and how it organizes itself in other spheres, notably with respect to antipoverty programs and (2) for the marketlike conditions under which the need for new interorganizational relations (here for hospital councils) is transformed into demand that brings about their formation. The second finding suggests that the degree of relationship between demand and supply depends upon organizationally induced variations in the marketplace. Both findings indicate that the integrative significance of government and voluntary associations may rest less upon linking individuals to their environment than upon linking organizations to one another, thereby supporting the feasibility of an interorganizational level of analysis.

AB  - Cities are the “engines of growth” because entrepreneurial and cre- ative activities are concentrated in cities. This suggests that cities grow by host- ing new businesses and “churning” industries advantageously. In so doing, cities need to adapt their spatial structure to mitigate negative externalities. Our previous paper (Lee and Gordon 2007) found that the links between urban structure and growth vary across metro size: more clustering in small metros and more dispersion in large metros were associated with faster employment growth. In this paper, we extend our research to investigate to what extent ur- ban spatial structure variables – dispersion and polycentricity – influence net new business formation (NNBF) and industrial “churning” in a cross-section of 79 U.S. metropolitan areas in the 2000s. The results of least squares regression and locally weighted regression analyses are mixed. OLS results for recent years fail to replicate our results for the 1990s. But applying a more powerful LOESS approach does give results for spatial impacts on NNBF and industrial churning that are consistent with the links between spatial structure and urban growth found in the earlier paper.

AB  - This paper developed a method to assess the appropriateness of urban structure via evaluating the accessibility of public transportation. Through a validated accessibility index, it combined the physical setting of urban environments with the residents' satisfactions toward public transportation. Taking Beijing as an example, this paper first analyzed the influencing factors of the accessibility of public transportation from three perspectives including public service, local development status, transportation and road construction. Then, it built a hierarchical logistic regression model of satisfaction. It was found that the satisfaction of people varied spatially, with the marginal effect of within the 5th Ring Road being lower than that outside the 5th Ring Road. The connectivity to the main places of the city by public transportation, and the density of bus stops within a distance of 800 m were found to have significantly affected the satisfaction of people toward public transportation. In addition, people of different attributes valued differently. The results had implications for improving the transportation environment of Beijing. (1) At present, the investment of public transportation should focus on the areas in the built-up areas inside the 5th Ring Road rather than the suburban areas. (2) It is socially desirable that the 800-m-service areas of bus stops cover the whole city; and according to the function of various areas, the optimal density of bus stops should be different. (3) The connectivity to the main function nodes of the city by public transportation should top the agenda on the planning of bus lines, as it can substantially improve the efficiency of public transportation system and the satisfaction of the people. (4) The spatial distribution of the people with different attributes such as age and income should be taken into account when local public transportation policies are made.

AB  - In this paper, we study the time-optimal trajectory planning of a sensor attached to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to provide complete 3-dimensional coverage with applications to urban environments with 2.5-dimensional features. The basic approach is to approximate the features of interest with a set of non planar coverage surfaces and to design a motion plan that guarantees the coverage surface is swept completely with a conical-field-of-view sensor. We establish a lower bound on time for a UAV to achieve complete coverage and derive the analytical coverage plan whose duration is a constant times this lower bound. Our hardware-in-the-loop simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - Full article: A project to promote sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plants in the mountains of China’s Upper Yangtze ecoregion has won the prestigious Equator Prize 2012.   The Equator Prize recognizes outstanding local initiatives working to advance sustainable development solutions for people, nature and resilient communities in countries receiving support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).   It is the second time the success of the project has been publicly acknowledged; in October 2011, the project received an “Outstanding Contribution Award” from the Chinese State Ministry of Environmental Protection, EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), Ministry of Commerce and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Over-harvesting of wild medicinal plant species is a serious conservation concern—aside from problems caused by the harvesting itself, the collectors can also have serious secondary impacts through camping within reserves, hunting and gathering fuel-wood to dry commercial quantities of medicinal plants. Such habitat destruction and disturbance also threatens endangered wildlife, including the Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the Takin Budorcas taxicolor.   The collection of medicinal plants in the Upper Yangtze is rising, with households compensating for loss of income from farming and timber logging due to the promulgation of two policies: a 1998 logging ban and a “Grain for Green” programme, introduced in 2000, which discourages farming on steep slopes.  To help alleviate matters, an initiative was developed through a comprehensive collaboration between WWF, IUCN and TRAFFIC as part of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), which led to local producer association members, harvesters and governmental officials receiving training in the implementation of organic wild crop harvesting practices and certification procedures, as well as application of the FairWild Standard principles.   “We are delighted to see public recognition of the success of this initiative, which has demonstrated how sustainable harvesting of wild plant resources creates positive benefits for local livelihoods and conservation efforts,” said Anastasiya Timoshyna, TRAFFIC’s Medicinal Plant Programme Leader.  Income for local producers in the project areas has increased, thanks to higher prices paid for certified sustainably harvested medicinal and aromatic plants. In the case of Schisandra berries Schisandra sphenanthera, international and local buyers paid at least 30% above normal market prices for certified produce. A survey of project sites in March 2011 found incomes from medicinal plant collection had risen, thanks to the certification schemes; in one village by almost 18% over 2007 levels.   The project also led to the establishment of links between producer associations and buyer groups: two communities have signed purchase agreements with a local winery and the newly established Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Cooperative has signed a 5-year fair trade agreement with a Californian company for supply of sustainably harvested Schisandra fruits.   In 2010, more than 5 tonnes (dry weight) of Schisandra fruits were sustainably harvested of which more than 3 tonnes were sold to Draco Natural Products (DNP Shanghai) for production of a concentrated dry extract specified by US-based Traditional Medicinals Inc (TMI). The project has scaled up from one village in the 2008 and 2009 harvests up to 22 villages in the 2011 harvest. From the autumn 2011 harvest, about 11.5 tonnes were shipped to DNP, enough to produce about 1.2 tonnes of certified organic dried extract for use in TMI products.   Further development of the project, supported through the Kangmei Institute of Community Development and Marketing has seen further adoption of sustainable harvesting methods in the region, and communities working through international partnerships to promote a ‘giant panda friendly’ brand and to create panda friendly certification standards for local harvesters.   “This project is proving that local harvesters from villages surrounding the Giant Panda conservation area can successfully implement meaningful sustainability standards,” said Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability for TMI.  “The Schisandra harvesters are helping to protect the panda bear habitat from disturbance while working to conserve biodiversity and earning additional household income through an organic and fair price premium.  “Traditional Medicinals remains committed to a long-term equitable trade relationship with the 22 participating villages represented by the Shuijing TCM Cooperative.   “Schisandra is only the first success story. As other wild medicinal plant species are added to the cooperative’s sustainable wild harvesting management plan, with eventual certified organic and panda friendly designations, household income will increase as a result of empowering and rewarding local communities for the important work of nature conservation.”

When households do not observe the price of the public good directly and because of the external economy arising from city size, the local government cannot determine the optimal property tax rate from empirical observation of consumer behavior. The relation between the property tax rate and city size is indeterminate. When land is necessary for public good production, there is an optimal amount of revenue sharing. The property tax rate alone, only under exceptional circumstances, can be used to limit city size and the amount of land in housing production.

The chapter illustrates the potential of DeSC for safeguarding privacy in a dynamic location-based services scenario: Mobile service users protect their potentially sensitive location by the use of a decentralized query algorithms, solely collaborating with peers close by and thereby excluding the privacy bottleneck of an omniscient global service provider. In an extensive set of consecutive experiments several decentralized query algorithms were tested, trading the level of privacy for the quality of service. The use of a real world test bed, - a small part of Ordnance Survey's OS MasterMap (R) Integrated Transport Network (TM) Layer for Southampton - underlines the experiments' validity. The chapter concludes with a research and development agenda for DeSC in the urban context.

AB  - Urban areas have developed under anthropogenic impact and hence feature strongly altered environmental conditions that influence today’s plant species distribu- tion. Generally, urban areas are rich in plant species, but on smaller scales richness can vary considerably. Our study aim is to identify areas of high species richness and to assess richness distribution patterns in the city of Hamburg by analyzing a floristic mapping dataset on the scale of 1 km2. Differences in plant species richness were analyzed between three urbanization zones. With multiple regression analyses, we tested effects of urban structure, habitat, and environmental conditions on the distri- bution of species richness measures. Total species richness per 1 km2 was 274±60 on average and differed only slightly between the urbanization zones. It increased with habitat diversity and decreased with Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for nutrients (multiple R2=0.31). Proportion of non-native species increased with mean annual temperature and decreased with EIVs for moisture (multiple R2=0.72), while propor- tion of endangered species increased with EIVs for moisture and decreased with EIVs for nutrients (multiple R2=0.66). Proportion of thermophilic species (multiple R2=0.58) could be explained bymean annual temperature. The emerging patterns probably differ from those in other cities due to the central port harboring a particular flora. Besides the expected high proportions of non-native species, high proportions of endangered species were also found in this area. Our results contribute to identifying drivers of biodiversity in cities and can thus be used to develop measures for the conservation of urban biodiversity.

AB  - Full article: New York, USA, 25th September 2012—Poaching and the illicit trafficking of wildlife products were raised on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time this Monday, during discussions on strengthening national and international governance. World leaders gathering in New York for the global body’s 67th annual meeting highlighted wildlife trafficking along with other severe threats to the rule of law such as corruption and drug running.  In a written statement, permanent Security Council member United States highlighted “the harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts, rule of law, governance and economic development.” The rapidly-growing illicit international trade in endangered species products, such as rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger parts, is now estimated to be worth $5 billion per year globally.   “Such organized crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing,” Gabon’s President Ali Bongo said during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. “Gabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon. But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperation.”   Permanent member France also emphasized the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime. “There are still entire sectors of activity without any legal safety,” French Minister Delegate for Development Pascal Canfin said. “International law is lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural resources, for example, or the trafficking of fauna.”   President Bongo took the occasion to reaffirm his country’s commitment to “combating violations of the Convention on International Trade [in] Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora as well as other conventions to protect the environment and biodiversity.”  In response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa, President Bongo oversaw the burning of Gabon’s seized ivory stockpile earlier this year after a full audit supported by WWF and TRAFFIC. Organized criminal syndicates, sometimes linked to armed insurgent groups, are believed to be behind many of the tens of thousands of elephant poaching deaths occurring in Africa each year. Ivory tusks are highly valuable on Asian black markets.   “Illicit wildlife trafficking can have severe consequences for people as well as the environment, yet it is not considered a serious crime by many governments. It is often a low risk and high profit criminal activity, which is a dangerous combination,” said Wendy Elliott, WWF Global Species Programme Manager. “Governments have made a significant step forward by introducing the issue into this important forum on the rule of law. We now call on all them to increase their law enforcement responses to wildlife crime on a commensurate basis.” Roland Melisch, Director of TRAFFIC’s Africa & Europe programmes said: “Good governance is essential to prevent crimes such as illicit wildlife trafficking. Countries need to be held accountable to their commitments under relevant United Nations treaties.”  WWF and its partner TRAFFIC, the wildlife monitoring network, are campaigning for greater protection of threatened species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants. In order to save endangered animals, source, transit and demand countries must all improve law enforcement, customs controls and judicial systems. WWF and TRAFFIC are also urging governments in consumer countries to undertake demand reduction efforts to curb the use of endangered species products.

AB  - Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles.

AB  - Global tendencies of urban structure changes, resulting from changes in technology and in the economy show first evidence by causing decentralization in the surroundings of big cities (Sassen, 1994). Such changes are taken as a challenge to look for new patterns of urban structure development and for new policies of development guidance in East Germany. The paper acknowledges the differences between east and west German traces of long-term urban structure development. The contribution regards the problems of East-German towns (inner area decline, loss of population, repeated waves of sub-urbanisation under GDR and FRG- governments) as indicators for opportunities in urban structure development. It concentrates on a case of example, a site in the city of Magdeburg, where the property market shows interest despite the fact that the town continues to loose inhabitants since 1990. Being part of the restructuring of an old industrialised area beside an old local core, being located near to the city centre and adjacent to the river Elbe, the site represents equally opportunities for the development of urban structure and of urban space. The urban qualities of the location indicate the opportunity for a new "nucleus" of urban development and promise a contribution to a competitive regional economy (s. Healey, 1993). Therefore, general criteria for qualities of urban development (Bentley e.a.) are referred to as a scale for evaluating existing and new conditions of the usability and the legibility of urban structures. This scale is supposed to represent processes of development which aim to a differentiated system of private and public spaces in a changing system of interconnected hierarchies of urban space. The article comprises - firstly, defining the subject and the questions of investigation, - secondly, introducing the reflection of long term and recent political influences on urban structure and urban space and reminding the major changes in property ownership from 1990, - thirdly, regarding the case of example concerning indications for new patterns of urban development and understandings of co-operation and competition from a practical point of view by evaluating the approach of the community in comparison to a students project, having been supervised by the author, - finally, drawing conclusions from the case about perspectives for guidance through planning gain which may provide new patterns of urban structure, new forms of cooperation and an alternative understanding of competition in the planning and development process.

AB  - Urban traffic structure is the core issue of urban transportation industry. Reasonable urban traffic structure can meet urban residential transit demand, and also reduce greenhouse-gas emission of vehicles so as to decrease negative environment impact. Based on the principles of low-carbon economy, a quantitative model for environmental impact of urban traffic structure is established in this paper, which includes two sub-models. The first sub-model is urban traffic structure optimization model, which considers transport efficiency as target variable and various traffic factors as constraint variables. MOBILE software can be used to calculate carbon emission factors of different vehicles. The second sub-model is to calculate carbon emission gross of vehicles and analyze influence of different changing factors by using COMMUTER software. The quantitative model and corresponding analysis results will offer valuable suggestions for urban transport planning and environment protection.

AB  - The intriguing associations between urban structure and inhabitants’ experiences, behaviour and wellbeing are at the core of people-environment research. With a new, place-based approach the various interpretations of inhabitant friendly, health promotive urban environments a) can be studied in close connection to the actual physical characteristics of the locations and b) the research findings can be transferred to the practitioners in visually informative form. The SoftGIS methodology developed in Aalto University enables the combination of ‘soft’ subjective data with ‘hard’, objective GIS-data. With the help of internet-based queries large empirical data can be gathered among various user groups, both children and adults. The softGIS data collected from the Helsinki metropolitan area and in the city of Turku among both adults (n=3100) and children (n=2800) reveal interesting associations between urban density, the proportion of green structure, the perceived quality of the environment, active living and the wellbeing and happiness of inhabitants.

AB  - Dengue is currently the most important arboviral disease globally and is usually associated with built environments in tropical areas. Remotely sensed information can facilitate the study of urban mosquito-borne diseases by providing multiple temporal and spatial resolutions appropriate to investigate urban structure and ecological characteristics associated with infectious disease. In this study, coarse, medium and fine resolution satellite imagery (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and QuickBird respectively) and ground-based data were analyzed for the Greater Puntarenas area, Costa Rica for the years 2002-04. The results showed that the mean normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was generally higher in the localities with lower incidence of dengue fever during 2002, although the correlation was statistically significant only in the dry season (r = -0.40; p = 0.03). Dengue incidence was inversely correlated to built area and directly correlated with tree cover (r = 0.75, p = 0.01). Overall, the significant correlations between dengue incidence and urban structural variables (tree cover and building density) suggest that properties of urban structure may be associated with dengue incidence in tropical urban settings.

In a comprehensive case study of the Copenhagen metropolitan area, Næss combines traditional quantitative travel surveys with qualitative interviews in order to identify the more detailed mechanisms through which urban structure affects travel behaviour. The case study findings are compared with those from other Nordic countries and analyzed and evaluated in the light of relevant theory and literature to provide solid, valuable conclusions for planning sustainable urban development. With a broader range of statistics than previous studies and conclusions of international relevance, Urban Structure Matters provides well-grounded conclusions for how spatial planning of urban areas can be used to reduce car dependence and achieve a more sustainable development of cities.

Several models of an urban structure resembling buildings and canyons were constructed by using concrete blocks in cubic form. By building and dismantling the urban models, the albedo change as a function of solar zenith angle was observed throughout the year. The result shows that the absorption increment originating from the irregular urban structure amounts to about 20% as compared with the absorption by a flat surface of the same material. The amount of additional absorption depends on the relative area occupied by canyons in the model.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of information and communication technologies (ICT) on urban structure. Improvements in ICT may lead to changes in urban structure, for example, because they reduce the costs of communicating ideas from a distance. Hence, they may weaken local agglomeration forces and thus provide incentives for economic activity to relocate to smaller urban centres. We use international data on city size distributions in different countries and on country-level characteristics to test the effect of ICT. We find robust evidence that increases in the number of telephone lines per capita encourage the spatial dispersion of population in that they lead to a more concentrated distribution of city sizes. So far the evidence on internet usage is more speculative, although it goes in the same direction. We argue that the internet is likely to have similar, or even larger, effects on urban structures once its use has spread more thoroughly through different economies.

AB  - Road traffic plays a crucial role in the shaping of urban spatial structure. The research on the relationship between them has always been a hot topic to economists, urban geographers and urban planning experts. Especially after the entering of 21st century, various problems have emerged with the rapid development of cities. Therefore, it has become a popular concern for both the government and academic circles about how to use road traffic efficiently to create an intensive urban space structure, thus solving the problems arising during the development of the city. The thesis reviews relevant research achievements about the intensive use of urban space based on road traffic systematically, as well as pointing out the prospect of future development in this field from the following aspects: the influences road traffic has on both urban exterior spatial pattern and urban interior spatial structure; the effects urban space has on road traffic and the urban space planning oriented to the road traffic.

Assuming consumers minimize costs in choosing between competing travel modes, the 19-equation model demonstrates that land rent differentials are diminished by adding an alternative travel mode, and that transport capacity is far more important than fare structures in determining transit patterns and land use. American urban structure appears to resemble European urban patterns as transportation modes proliferate.

AB  - In this paper we describe our novel use of space syntax for the design and development of pervasive systems. Pervasive systems are computer systems that are designed to be “invisible” to users because they are designed to blend in with their environment and become part of the fabric of everyday life. Pervasive systems consist of fixed, mobile and embedded components, each of which may entail interactive capabilities and intelligence. Due to their close relationship with the build environment, pervasive systems are an ideal domain for adopting a space syntax methodology. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we present an adaptation of the space syntax methodology aimed at researchers and designers of space and pervasive systems. By developing an adaptation of the space syntax methodology we intend for space syntax to be added the arsenal of tools and theo- ries that researchers use to understand and design pervasive systems. To exem- plify how this can be achieved, we present three case studies that demonstrate cru- cial ways in which space syntax analysis can aid the design of pervasive systems. The case studies presented here show how space syntax can be used in the devel- opment of pervasive system as an application development tool, as an exploratory tool, and as a modelling tool.

AB  - This paper is addressed to the problem of developing realistic-looking patterns of land use and activity from predictions generated by conventional urban models. The method developed is based on a geometric model of irregularity involving hierarchical cascading and recursion, whose rationale lies in the emergent field of fractal geometry. First the idea of fractans - shapes with fractional dimension - is introduced and then it is shown how two-dimensional patterns whose dimensions are consistent with a large city such as London can be simulated at different levels of detail or recursion. It is then argued that the hierarchical structure of cities should be exploited as a basis for such simulation, and it is argued that discrete choice models of individual spatial behaviour have excellent properties which enable their embedding into such simulations. The standard multinomial logit model is presented and then applied to house-type data in Greater London. A variety of models are estimated, house-type choice being related to age and distance from the centre of the city, and the spatial biases in these predictions are then mapped using prediction success statistics. These models are then used at the base level of a fractal simulation of house type and location in London. Random and deterministic model simulations are developed, and an unusual and possibly innovative feature of these simulations involves the way the inputs and outputs, data and predictions, are simultaneously displayed on the graphics device used. Conclusions for further research, particularly in spatial hierarchical modelling, are then sketched.

AB  - A place exists in a space (footprint) which evolves over a temporal extent (lifeline). This study focuses on those places such as cities or component places within cities (hereafter referred to as city places or simply places). It concerns the modeling and analysis of places from the integrative spatio-temporal perspective. Drawing on recent research development related to spatio-temporal ontology, this study discusses a spatio-temporal ontology specific to city places. The ontology distinguishes between the static view of places (Static-Place) and the dynamic view of spatial-temporal regions led by spatio-temporal processes (ST-Place). The study considers places as spatio-temporal constructs. It proposes the concept of primitive ST region for the construction of spatio-temporal regions and ultimately spatio-temporal places. The study then presents a spatio-temporal data model to link spatial features and the spatio-temporal processes. In this way, the study models an ST-place from a spatio-temporal perspective by forming high dimensional spatio-temporal regions. Based on this conceptual data model, the study further discusses the potential use of this model in spatio-temporal analysis in general and in reasoning spatio-temporal topological relations in particular.

AB  - Full article: Geneva, Switzerland, 26th July 2012—Statisticians from the University of Reading in partnership with TRAFFIC are helping in the global fight against the trade of illegal ivory, with a major revision of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), a global monitoring system for tracking illegal ivory trade.  With elephant poaching levels the worst they have been in a decade, and recorded ivory seizures at their highest levels since 1989, the revised system will give accurate and up-to-date information on the illegal trade of ivory. This will be of huge benefit for international and national policy makers on elephant conservation and on illicit trade who have previously struggled to get reliable and timely data.  At the heart of the upgrade is an innovative new database that allows countries to report seizures of illegal ivory online, making data entry easier and more accurate than ever before.  It will also encourage more countries to report illegal ivory trade as they will be able to access statistical summaries of their data and review other seizures where their country is implicated.  TRAFFIC manages ETIS on behalf of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is one of two elephant monitoring systems under CITES, the other being the Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) system.  The revised online ETIS will be showcased today at the CITES Standing Committee currently taking place in Geneva. In attendance will be representatives from many of the CITES Parties who will use the revised system. They will witness the functionality and the effectiveness of the database by way of a demonstration, ahead of its launch in September 2012.  Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood, statisticians from the University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, have worked closely with TRAFFIC to develop the revised ETIS. Dr Underwood, project leader, said: "We are very pleased that we are able to provide a solid statistical foundation to ETIS to ensure that it provides high quality and timely information on the illegal ivory trade at a crucial time for elephants." Recording illegal ivory seizures is just one aspect of the revised monitoring system, which now has enhanced capability to provide indicators of hidden illegal activity.  Applied Statistics Research Fellow Bob Burn, who conceived the current project and has been involved with ETIS since its inception in 1997, said: "Not all illegal ivory transactions are discovered or officially reported.  The challenge in analysing seizures data is to adjust for this gap by accounting for factors such as law enforcement effort and corruption. Using cutting edge statistical methods the monitoring system can now begin to combat this problem."  The statistical analyses will provide information on how patterns of illegal trade are changing over time and will identify problem countries so that attention can be focused upon those countries most heavily implicated in illicit trade. This provides crucial evidence for CITES and individual governments in their decision making when it comes to elephant conservation. The work was carried out under a Darwin Initiative project, led by the University of Reading, funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  UK Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: "These magnificent creatures are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers, and if we don't act now they may not have a future. This database, funded by Defra's Darwin Initiative, will accurately record illegal ivory seizures so we get a real picture of what is happening on the ground. This information can be shared around the world to help stop the illegal trade in ivory and put poachers out of business."  TRAFFIC's Tom Milliken, who manges ETIS, added: "Since 1997, our long-term collaboration with Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood from the University of Reading has progressively scaled up the science behind ETIS and made it a ‘best practice', state-of-the-art monitoring tool for the global conservation community.  TRAFFIC, but also elephants, trumpet their appreciation to Bob and Fiona and the Darwin Initiative!"  The database was developed in collaboration with Solertium Corporation, USA.

AB  - Urban riparian habitats are potentially important resources for native birds in arid ecosystems. Most studies have assessed the value of urban riparian habitat in terms of vegetation and natural resources; however, the surrounding land use and infrastructure may determine the viability of urban habitat. We studied the impact of urban struc- ture, the combination of land use, infrastructure and vegetation variables that work together to shape the urban environment, on avian riparian habitat in the Truckee Meadows, Nevada, USA. Land use and infrastructure explained avian species richness and abundance better than local vegetation alone, but community resemblance was more strongly correlated to vegetation. Avian species guilds responded differentially to surrounding land use, suggesting there may be a functional difference between land use types. The best models for bird diversity used urban structure (both land use and vegetation) to describe potential habitat. Urban structure describes urban habitat in ways that vegetation variables alone cannot. Studies that ignore land use and infra- structure and other socioeconomic variables are likely missing key functional differ- ences within urban ecosystems, and may miss the potential for compatible development that encourages both biodiversity and urban growth.

AB  - This paper seeks to extend the definition of a sub-centre beyond the usual definition as a place with significantly larger employment density that has an effect on the overall employment density of the nearby locations. Together with the previous conditions, it is suggested that it is necessary to include another which represents a structural element of an urban sub-system within the metropolitan configuration-that is, a place with intense spatial interaction with its hinterland. Therefore, a metropolitan area can be seen as one comprising urban sub-systems characterised by greater or lesser polycentrism. In this paper, a 'bottom-up' methodology based on commuter flows is proposed in order to detect metropolitan sub-centres. Using empirical data from the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, the proposed methodology is tested, comparing its results with those of other commonly used methodologies (cut-offs, parametric and non-parametric models). The results suggest that the proposed methodology permits optimising the sub-centre delimitation process.

AB  - Different discipline-specific methodological approaches to assess the vulnerability of the "urban environment" to climate change risks require a commonly accepted spatial working basis, which can ensure that the resulting heterogeneous investigations can be transdisciplinarily integrated by using an adequate spatially explicit classification. Therefore an 'urban typology' concept was developed and will be used as a practicable method to structure the spatial order of the sensitivity of settlement areas in HCMC. The Housingrelated 'urban typology' provides a uniform methodological and spatial framework for the different tasks within the interdisciplinary network of the research project to aid the development of future climate change resilience- Building and thus resilience- Urban Structure. The case study is based on initial research experiences of the development of GIS-based vulnerability indicators in the application area of adaptation of a high-risk agglomeration area to the future impacts of Climate Change. Based on the extended Urban Structure Type (UST) approach(HAGGAG & AYAD 2002). The proposed model represents an interpretative method to respond and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

In doing so, we outline a methodology for recreating the urban spatial structure of the six-square-kilometer Tiwanaku capital.

AB  - Recently a growing number of investigations is dealing with the characterization and partitioning of urban agglomerations into urban structure types (USTs) based on remote sensing data. Since the USTs of interest are usually chosen with respect to the research question, application and type of urban agglomeration there is a need for a flexible and adaptable approach for automatic UST classification. In this study we identify the commonalities of published approaches and derive requirements and tasks to deal with in UST classification. Based on this, we focus on the development of a UST classification system that is highly automated, flexible and adaptable to enable a wide applicability.

AB  - Traditionally, city classification studies have been considered descriptive. Empirical results have typically not been applied to explain or predict other urban characteristics. This pattern was reversed in the 1980s by the application of the results of two well-known classification studies as independent variables in a regression analysis. In performing statistical inference, it was implicitly assumed that the classifications provide measures of unobservable theoretical constructs. In this paper, it is argued that knowledge of a classification's validity is required prior to performing such inference. An example of a construct validation is provided by proposing that the physical and spatial characteristics of urban areas may in part be described by four independent dimensions and an attempt is made to operationalise and validate appropriate measures. -Author

AB  -  The purpose of this paper is to understand the relationship between the surface temperature distribution and urban structure in Tokyo metropolitan area. ASTER data and LIDAR data both are used for this analysis. The daytime (2001.9.24 at 10:39 JST) and night (2001.9.22 at 21:54 JST) scenes of ASTER TIR are used for the surface temperature in daytime and night. The same daytime scene of ASTER VNIR is also used for the land-cover. LIDAR data, 3D point clouds from the remote airborne mapping system, is used for the building height. As results, the distribution of the surface temperature is high at residential areas and low at business centers and main roads in daytime, and then it is reversed in night. The correlation between the surface temperature and the urban structure shows 1) green areas have a good impact on the urban heat environment and these areas are not enough, and 2) tall buildings make shadows and fall the surface temperature in daytime, but raise it for obstructing winds in night.

AB  - The concept of 'automobile dependence', interpreted as a path-dependence phenomenon, informs this assessment of urban transport and structure trends in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area (KLMA). 'Automobile-dependent' cities, where high private vehicle use is strongly entrenched, are contrasted with 'traffic-saturated' cities, in which modest numbers of vehicles cause great problems for urban structures that are unsuited to them. Data from a recent international compilation are used to place the KLMA's patterns into perspective. The KLMA is found to be not yet very automobile dependent but a number of strong trends are encouraging and entrenching ever higher private motor vehicle use. Agencies in the KLMA are investing heavily in car-oriented mobility, while building urban designs that are hostile to non-car alternatives, yet with densities that may be incompatible with high car ownership and usage. These trends seem to run the risk of entrenching an intractable traffic crisis.

AB  - This paper begins the task of integrating models of racist behavior into general theories of urban land use. The paper derives equilibrium prices for a racist city and demonstrates that the city is less dense at the core, more dense in the suburbs, and covers a larger area than an unprejudiced city. A more complex theory of housing supply is then developed, and it is shown that racism's impact on the ghetto depends upon the ease with which maintenance can be reduced, the cost of replacing abandoned housing, and the nature of legal controls on housing quality.
