AB  - Steam boilers are used to generate steam in order to meet the duty requirements of cold process streams. The most common heat exchanger network layout associated with the boiler is a completely parallel design, where the duty of each cold process stream is met by an external hot utility stream. This observation suggests that the flow rate of steam needed for the system can be reduced, while maintaining the required duty, simply by introducing series connections to the layout of the network (Kim, J. K.; Smith, R. Cooling water system design. Chem. Eng. Sci. 2001, 56, 3641?3658). Phase change of saturated steam to saturated liquid plays a vital role in the targeting method as well as the design of the network layout, since the saturated liquid (and resulting reuse liquid) is also used to meet the cold process duty requirements. A hybrid graphical and mathematical technique for targeting and network synthesis is presented. The main objective of the technique is to reduce steam flow rate without compromising the duty requirements of the process heat exchangers. In order to assess the advantage of a hybrid technique, a case study is used where a steam savings of 29.6% is obtained, compaired with using just saturated steam. We further present a complete mathematical technique to demonstrate the advantage of the graphical targeting concept in solution time improvement.\nSteam boilers are used to generate steam in order to meet the duty requirements of cold process streams.

AB  - "When there are two or more data systems and none of them enumerates the population at an acceptable completeness level, concern about the bias due to underenumeration suggests an estimator which makes joint use of data compiled by the combined imperfect data systems.  Conventional dual system estimators are based on the existence of two separate data collection systems.  Dual system network estimators assume a main survey and a follow-up quality check survey.  The main survey adopts a multiplicity counting rule that combines two mutually exclusive partial counting rules."  Three dual system network estimators are presented.  "One was previously proposed by Sirken (1979) and is the natural analogue of the conventional dual system estimator.  The two other estimators are proposed as potential improvements, although neither of them is the natural analogue of the conventional dual system estimator.  The design effects of the three estimators are compared analytically and empirically with one another, and with those of the single system conventional and network estimators."  (summary in FRE)

AB  - We are living in an advanced information society. The information revolution in computers is going on, among other areas, in the field of marketing. Until now, the term “Information System” has been used in the field of marketing mainly to refer to market research. We need to make the most of this information to aid decision making in new product development and sales promotion. It is fundamental that marketing be consumer oriented. However, the real needs of a contemporary consumer include factors which cannot be revealed by a questionnaire survey. The progresses of computer technology and its reduction in price has enabled the construction of a network system in the distribution stage.  The construction and application of a network system suitable to contemporary marketing management has now become part of the challenge facing business management. They must collect and process distribution information with speed and efficiency. And they must obtain information that is up-to-minute and sufficiently detailed for marketing activity which can then be carried out effectively with small risk. In other words, a company manager who is supported by an information system has come to be able to control in minute detail the information regarding purchase actions of various consumers.

AB  - Abstract The World Climate Research Programme's Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) addresses both the hydrological and meteorological components of the water cycle. One of the biggest challenges in GEWEX is to improve the understanding of how the wide range of processes within clouds affects the atmosphere on the large scale and, thereby, to develop ways of parameterizing these processes within climate and NWP models. The Joint Scientific Committee of WCRP at its 1992 meeting approved the establishment of a GEWEX Cloud System Study (GCSS) as a long-term program that will address these issues mainly through the development of cloud-resolving models and their use to generate realizations of a set of archetypal cloud systems. The focus of GCSS is on cloud systems spanning the mesoscale rather than on individual clouds. Observations from field programs will be used to develop and validate the cloud-resolving models, which in turn will be used as test-beds to develop the parameterizations for the...

AB  - This paper proposes an integrated model for assessing the impact of interdependency of electricity and natural gas networks on power system security. The integrated model incorporates the natural gas network constraints into the optimal solution of security-constrained unit commitment. The natural gas network is modeled by daily and hourly limits on pipelines, sub-areas, plants, and generating units. The application of fuel diversity (e.g., generating units with fuel switching capability) is presented as an effective peak shaving strategy for natural gas demand which could hedge price volatilities of natural gas and electric power. The proposed model can be used by a vertically integrated utility for the commitment and dispatch of generating units and the allocation of natural gas for the next day utilization. The proposed model can also be used for measuring the security of social services by modeling the interdependency of natural gas and electric power system infrastructures. If the proposed model is used by GENCOs, gas constraints will be submitted to electricity markets as energy constraints. Illustrative examples show the impact of natural gas supply infrastructure on the economic operation of a vertically integrated utility. The examples also discuss the impact of generating units with fuel switching capability on the power system security when the supply of natural gas is limited.

Multiple database servers with heterogeneous user authentication protocols are linked to this network. "One-stop information shopping" implies one log-on procedure per session, not separate log-on and log-off procedures for each server or application used during a session. These circumstances provide challenges at the policy and technical levels to data security at the network level and insuring smooth information access for end users of these network-based services. Five activities being conducted as part of our security project are described: (1) policy development; (2) an authentication server for the network; (3) Kerberos as a tool for providing mutual authentication, encryption, and time stamping of authentication messages; (4) a prototype interface using Kerberos services to authenticate users accessing a network database server; and (5) a Kerberized electronic signature.

The source of this quantity is from current transformers (CT's) which are located on or near the protected equipment. CT's are used to provide isolation from the power system and reduction in magnitude to a level usable by relays and meters. Protective relays use this quantity in numerous ways to determine if the protected system is abnormal and requires isolation. Failure of CT's to perform as designed has resulted in failure to trip, failure to trip promptly and tripping when not required.

Accurate load models capturing load behaviors during dynamics are therefore necessary to allow more precise calculations of power system controls and stability limits. Recently artificial neural network (ANN) techniques have been widely used in power system simulation analysis. This paper deals with data recorded during the field experiments in power systems using a kind of multilayer feed forward (MLFP) networks with error back- propagation (BP) algorithm and a kind of aggregate load model with least square identification. The results show that the ANN model with the improved back-propagation learning rule have a satisfactory interpolation and extrapolation ability, and also have the ability to describe the voltage-power non-linear relationship of load dynamic characteristics.

AB  - The Uruguayan power system is highly dependent on two 500 kV transmission lines connecting the largest generation site (Salto Grande) and the Argentinean interconnection in the North, to the largest loading area in the South. Actual occurrences, where both 500 kV lines tripped, lead the system to widespread blackouts including the critical area of Montevideo, the nation's capital district. This paper presents an investigation of a controlled separation of the Uruguayan network into two stable islands, using power swing blocking (PSB) and out-of-step tripping (OST) protection functions. The investigation is based on transient stability studies using comprehensive models and, on the role of PSB and OST covering many possible protection strategies. The study specifically compares the amount of load shedding necessary to achieve similar transient performance with and without a controlled islanding scheme. The results show first that the required load shedding is relatively high (about 500 MVA), and that the controlled islanding scheme allows similar transient performance with 20% saving of load curtailment.

Our analysis studies the stability properties of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) of the full n-city system in terms of the reproductive number R(0). Should vaccination reduce R(0) below unity, the disease will be eradicated in all n-cities.

AB  - Optimum power system stabilizer design has been a difficult task due to the nonlinear dynamics of the synchronous generators. An optimum power system stabilizer which is compensated for the nonlinear operation of the machine is described. A simple linear model of the synchronous machine is obtained at a given operating point by linearizing the nonlinear machine equations. The nonlinear characteristics of the machine are compensated by changing the linear model parameters depending on the prevailing operating condition of the machine. Optimum state feedback gains of the controller are calculated for the different sets of model parameters and scheduled according to the operating state. The algorithm presented can be considered as a generalization of the gain scheduling adaptive algorithms. Machine dynamics for different operating conditions are simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of this algorithm. The results show that the dynamic stability of the system is improved

AB  - A systemic management network system in dentistry is a remote dental support system, which can transmit portraits, voice, and vital sign data by an ISDN circuit. The network system consists of a center system apparatus and a terminal system apparatus (Fig. 1).The center system apparatus consists of a station PC, a headset, a camera, and a printer (Fig. 2). The terminal system apparatus consists of a TV phone unit, a camera and a vital sign monitor (Fig. 3). On the 17 th of October in 2000, we set up a center system apparatus in Department of Special Care Dentistry of Kagoshima University Dental Hospital and a terminal system apparatus in the Miyagi Dental Clinic in Okinawa Prefecture. Thereby, we can communicate with Dr. Miyagi. The difference between this network system and an ordinary TV phone is that the system is able to transmit the data obtained by a vital sign monitor to a station PC, and control remotely a vital sign monitor that is part of the terminal system apparatus from a station PC. A dentist in a dental office can thereby communicate with the staff in the Department of Special Care Dentistry about the general condition and preoperative evaluation of medically compromised patients who visit the dental office. And the staff can advise the dentist of stress reduction techniques and psychological sedation during dental treatment. If a medical emergency occurred with a patient in the dental office, the staff in Department of Special Care Dentistry could instruct the clinician On how to treat the patient, confirming blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, Spo2, pulse rate, pulse wave, and rate pressure product by such a systemic management network system. Recently, many patients with hypertension, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, cerebrovascular disorder, and diabetes mellitus have come to dental offices. These patients may be in danger because any dental procedure or psychological stress that can cause an elevation of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate may precipitate a heart attack or cerebrovascular accident. The network system is useful for supporting the systemic management during dental treatment in medically compromised patients who visit dental offices in regions far away from Kagoshima University Dental Hospital.

AB  - Network losses in electrical power delivery systems contribute, in-directly, to carbon emissions. Global and national carbon reduction programmes are crucial to meeting obligatory targets. In the UK, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) recognise the impact of distribution network power losses and offer incentives to operators to reduce emissions through the published Distribution Price Control Reviews (DPCR). With this increasing pressure upon distribution network operators (DNOs), the development of loss minimisation tools for the purpose of real time evaluation and control strategies for loss reduction could add value over the traditional methods used. This paper will build upon the research carried out within the Autonomous Regional Active Network Management System (AuRA-NMS) project with the scope of implementing a distribution network real power loss management algorithm. Results from development and integration, within a closed loop simulation environment on commercially available substation computing hardware, are presented.

AB  - The security of computer networks has been in the focus of research for years. While several sophisticated systems had been developed in the area of intrusion detection, new challenges arised. Pattern matching systems are not able to cope with high bandwidth (10 Gbps +) when analyzing the whole payload. Furthermore, new attack schemes arise by increasingly complex software and systems. New approaches like network behavior analyses (NBA) systems show promise for being able to cope with the new threats. These systems evaluate statistical flow data generated from the traffic of the monitored network. While originally designed for optimising traffic handling and accounting in the network, flow data appeared to be powerful for intrusion detection. NBA Systems based on machine learning techniques are able to evaluate these data and to recognize anomalies in the network. However, these systems suffer from a long-lasting learning phase and are susceptible to manipulations during that time. To overcome these shortcomings, we are introducing a fast-learning modular neural network based on pre-processed components. For the development of the new system, the possible attacks on NBA systems have to be investigated and understood in depth.

AB  - Distributed Generation (DG) is growing rapidly in power systems due to their potential solution for issues, like the deregulation in power system, to meet the power demand and the shortage of transmission capacities. Optimal placement of DG assumes significance that improper allocation of DG sources in power system would not only lead to increased power or energy losses, but can also jeopardize the system operation. Also optimal placement of DG is necessary for the maximization of reliability and stability in power system. In this paper classical grid search algorithm based on successive load flows has been employed to obtain optimal location and size of multiple DG units in radial power system network in order to minimize total active power losses and to improve voltage profile of the system. The proposed method is the extension of single DG placement to the placement of multiple DG units. It is significant because of the fact that with the integration of DG units at various locations, there is more reduction in total power losses and maximum voltage drop in the system is also decreased. The proposed method is tested on 12-bus radial distribution feeder with different sizes of DG source. The obtained results are presented in graphical manner

AB  - The real world is a three-dimensional (3D) space requiring that 3D geospatial information applications be developed in alignment with the observer's visual and perceptive habits. Particularly, 3D building model data are required in a wide range of areas such as urban planning, environmental protection, real estate management and emergency response. At the same time, the development of Web service technologies allows the possibility of the widely distributed 3D geospatial data on the web. 3D city building model with its related information is an important part in the construction of a digital city system, and has become a staple resource on the web nowadays. In view of the hierarchical representation of a 3D building model, an abstract of a 3D building model based on structure details is studied, and a novel representation approach named 3D transparent building hierarchical model is presented in this paper. This approach fully uses both the existing 3D modeling technologies and CAD constructing mapping data. By the spatial relationship description, structural components inside a building can be represented and integrated as hierarchical models in a unified 3D space. In addition, based on the characteristics of the 3D building model data, a service-oriented architecture and Web service technologies for 3D city building models are discussed. The aim of the approach is that 3D city building models can be used as a kind of data resource service on the web, and can also exist independently in various different web applications. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag 2010.

Since each sub-network has management privileges and policies individually, it is difficult to respond to harmful traffic such as warm viruses that affect entire networks. In this paper, we propose a high-level policy language and a middle-level data structure for the healthcare system. They were named Triton language and Common Access Management Form (CAMF) [Jangha Kim, et. al., 2004]. It enables the administrator to authorize a policy effectively and rapidly. Healthcare system networks have a number of administrators so that policy collision can occur.

AB  - Although the calculation capacity of the computer is increasing fast, the dynamic equivalence which works to generate the reduced equivalent power systems models is still irreplaceable. Coherency-based equivalence has been extensively used in engineering practice. However, there are still no wide-accepted rules or methods to decide the boundary of the retaining system and the system to be eliminated. This paper presents heuristic indices for preserving network decision and performance evaluation in power system dynamic equivalence. For validation purposes, this propose method is applied to a test system of IEEE 10 machine 39-bus system and dynamic equivalence of South China power grid in the year of 2010. Results show that the reduced system retains the dynamic performance of the original system with good accuracy, and the proposed method has good engineering value.

AB  -  Information transfer is of the most importance to the realization of modern SCADA controllers in power systems. To setup a relatively easy-installation communication network system for transferring controlling and sensing information, a CDMA2000 based cellular wireless communication system, i.e., the PowerWDN network, is introduced to such power SCADAs in this paper. By comparison with other wireless and wired communication platforms, the performance of PowerWDN is analyzed when applied to transfer power system signals. It is eventually revealed that, although being a little slower in response to sudden faults in power networks if compared with wired communication networks, the PowerWDN will still be of great significance to many practical uses in modern power systems, especially when the virtual private networking (VPN) technique is being applied.

AB  - The research constitutes the first effort to test the claim found in the world city theoretical literature that, as world cities strengthen ties with each other, their linkages with their countries' hinterlands and national urban systems will weaken. This research offers a more nuanced exploration of this hypothesis by taking into account variation in the nature of the state across countries in which world cities are located as well as the source of global capital in the world cities. Specifically, the research reported here suggests that three types of world cities-market-centred bourgeois world cities (MWC), state-centred political bureaucratic world cities (SWC) and dual-role world cities (DWC)-entail different deterritorialisation outcomes. Three countries that have prototypical global cities-Japan (SWC), China (DWC) and the US (MWC) are compared, applying longitudinal network modelling to relational data on national city networks. From 1993 to 2007, more globally connected MWCs weakened their national ties. In contrast, higher global status has no significant effect on the integration of SWCs or DWCs with their national urban systems. This indicates that the type of state, but not the source of capital, conditions whether the world city will deterritorialise vis-A-vis its national city system.

AB  - This chapter examines how XML technologies can be applied to network management tasks: modeling management information, instrumenting managed resources, management operations, communication between manager and agent, analyzing the data, and presenting the analysis result to users. An architectural framework for the development of XML-based network management systems have been presented. This framework can be used as a guideline for developing management systems. XML enables data to carry its metainformation in the form of an XML document. The metainformation is used for searching, filtering, and processing efficiently. The main benefits of XML are simplicity, extensibility, and openness. The simplicity of XML relies on tree structured text-based encoding of data, so one can easily create, read, and modify XML documents with even the most primitive text processing tools. XNM is a collection of network management methods that applies XML technologies to network management. Therefore, XNM employs the advantages of XML technologies and one can easily develop network management system using XML technologies. XML technology is viewed by many as a revolutionary approach for solving the problems that exist in current standards and practices for network and systems management. More work is needed to prove this by developing not only standards but also applying to manage real networks and systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is to investigate the power system operation strategy for an electrified mass rapid transit ( MRT ) network to enhance the loading factors of main transformers. The train motion equation has been applied to find the mechanical power demand profiles of the train set according to various operation modes by considering operation resistance. The DC load flow analysis is executed to derive the electric power loading of each traction substation and the AC load flow analysis is then performed to solve the dynamic loading behavior of main transformers for each time snapshot. To improve the loading factors of main transformers, the proper strategy of unit commitment and load transfer by switching operation are determined for the MRT operation during the peak and off peak periods. The Taipei MRT network is selected for computer simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. It is found that the loading factors of main transformers can be improved dramatically and the load balance among the transformers can be obtained by the proposed methodology.

AB  - Many opportunities exist to improve micro-architectural performance due to performance events that are difficult to optimize at static compile time. Cache misses and branch mis-prediction patterns may vary for different micro-architectures using different inputs. Dynamic optimization provides an approach to address these and other performance events at runtime. This paper describes a software system of real implementation that detects performance problems of running applications and deploys optimizations to increase execution efficiency. We discuss issues of detecting performance bottlenecks, generating optimized traces and redirecting execution from the original code to the dynamically optimized code. Our current system speeds up many of the CPU2000 benchmark programs having large numbers of D-Cache misses through dynamically deployed cache prefetching. For other applications that don't benefit from our runtime optimization, the average cost is only 2% of execution time. We present this lightweight system as an example of using existing hardware and software to deploy speculative optimizations to improve a program's runtime performance.

AB  - This report describes the motivations behind the development of the Balmorel model as well as the model itself. The purpose of the Balmorel project is to develop a model for analyses of the power and CHP sectors in the Baltic Sea Region. The model is directed towards the analysis of relevant policy questions to the extent that they contain substantial international aspects. The model is developed in response to the trend towards internationalisation in the electricity sector. This trend is seen in increased international trade of electricity, in investment strategies among producers and otherwise. Also environmental considerations and policies are to an increasing extent gaining an international perspective in relation to the greenhouse gasses. Further, the ongoing process of deregulation of the energy sector highlights this and contributes to the need for overview and analysis. A guiding principle behind the construction of the model has been that it may serve as a means of communication in relation to the policy issues that already are or that may become important for the region. Therefore, emphasis has been put on documentation, transparency and flexibility of the model. This is achieved in part by formulating the model in a high level modelling language, and by making the model, including data, available at the internet. Potential users of the Balmorel model include research institutions, consulting companies, energy authorities, transmission system operators and energy companies.

AB  - This report focuses on distance education within the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE) for the 2007-08 academic year and provides documentation of the substantial growth of distance education within all colleges and universities. Distance education is a field of continuous improvement and change, and NSHE institutions are constantly working to extend their offerings beyond their physical limits to meet the learning needs of students in Nevada. Without distance education many students, especially those living in Nevada's extensive rural areas and those with heavy work or family commitments, would not be able to pursue their higher education goals. The following are a few of the major highlights in this report: (1) The number of students enrolled in at least one distance education course increased from 5,798 in Fall 2001 to 24,656 in Fall 2007, an increase of 18,858 students or 325 percent; (2) The College of Southern Nevada (CSN) will soon launch the CSN Online Campus. The CSN Online Campus will meet the needs of the 100 percent online learners by providing all of the courses, programs, and services that are commonly provided to students attending traditional on campus courses and programs; (3) In order to provide a more robust support structure, Western Nevada College's (WNC) Library & Media Services reference librarians assumed responsibility as the first contact for students enrolled in online classes. This arrangement worked well over the past several years, with a record number of over 550 calls for assistance handled in student support; (4) Building on the universal deployment of WebCampus, all students admitted to Nevada State College (NSC) are enrolled automatically in an online course called "Student WebCampus Orientation". The course includes all of the WebCampus learning tools with related learning exercises; (5) Truckee Meadows Community College's (TMCC) WebCollege is developing a fast-track online degree program (courses offered in a 5-week online format) which will target nontraditional working adults and will offer an accelerated solution for degree completion. The degree program is slated to be launched in Spring 2010 and will feature credit for lifelong learning experience (where appropriate), a student academic plan, fostering student learning communities, and will focus on degree completion for nontraditional students; (6) The University of Nevada, Reno's (UNR) Teaching, Learning, and Technology staff is very active in training faculty to teach online. More than 1,000 class sections each semester have technology components. Technical support for online students through the Knowledge Center is excellent; (7) Since 2005, the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) Distance Education Office captions all streaming videos, which are used by distance education courses and sometimes the instructors' face to face campus sections. The captioning of videos ensures Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance. The shared use of distance education created materials utilizes scarce UNLV resources and upgrades educational effectiveness across the campus; and (8) Great Basin College's (GBC) distance education offerings currently account for over 51 percent of GBC's overall enrollment. Great Basin College's WebCampus continues to grow at an exceptional rate. The WebCampus has seen a 142 percent increase in FTE from Fall 2005 to Fall 2007. Students increasingly demand and expect distance education offerings. In order to meet the rising demand, some important elements should be examined in a statewide coordinated effort: infrastructure, faculty development and support, student services, accessibility, and the policies that govern distance education.

AB  - With the advent of modern day satellite technology, the electric utility industry is exploring opportunities to expand applications that can be served from space-based platforms. Traditionally, in the electric power industry the use of satellite-based technology is seen in many aspects of wide-area management -- weather satellites are used to provide information on demand and to thus, lower the probability of blackouts or brownouts; GPS satellites are used for system control by providing synchronized measurements; and Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites are being investigated for communication of the power system measurements with the desire to improve reliability and provide global coverage with low data latency. These LEO satellites are typically 500 -1500 km above the Earth's surface. The integration of satellite technology into power system operations is emerging now due not only to the large coverage area available from space, improvements in satellite reliability, and lower data-latency, but also the advent of lower cost small satellite buses. Today, satellite applications for power systems are an active area of research in such areas as wide area measurement, control, and communication.

AB  - Foreword : Railway stations are at the heart of the nation’s psyche. They feature in blockbuster films, romantic novels and the skylines of many towns and cities. However, they are far more important to the nation than as mere artistic reference points. Millions of people use the nation’s railway stations every day. Towns and cities have often developed around them, placing railway stations in the heart of many communities. The station can often help to provide an identity or symbol for the town or city; it can act as a point of reference as well as a civic amenity for people who want to use the station’s facilities, whether they are travelling or not. Done well, their design and operation helps to facilitate the success of the national rail network. A successful railway station will add to the passenger experience as well as support the economic, social and environmental benefits of rail. Their effective integration with other modes of transport and the surrounding area can provide for an end-to-end journey experience that makes sustainable public transport a real alternative to private vehicle usage. Given these varying demands on stations it is vitally important that they are planned, designed and improved in a manner that recognises all that they have to offer. I hope that this Guide will aid promoters, planners, architects and sponsors of station schemes to develop railway stations that maintain and enhance the legacy and contribution of stations going forward. Finally, I would like to thank the individuals and organisations who helped to shape and review this document including: Department for Transport, CABE, Transport for London, Stagecoach South West Trains, First Group, Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch, English Heritage, PTEG

The growth of the city system exhibits four stages that are evident from our quantitative analysis of the convergence of population in large cities and qualitative analysis of historical socioeconomic and technological developments. The decadal city size distributions in the aggregate evolve with a persistent pattern while individual cities over time shift positions in the urban hierarchy as the result of adapting or passing growth opportunities in infrastructure innovations, economic change, and industrial transformations. These decadal city size distributions exhibit persistent discontinuities that mainly occur in the upper and lower tails. The observed patterns and discontinuities are indicative of the stability and resilience of a complex adaptive system of cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The search for improvements in research performance is a powerful influence on all universities. Success in research is a major component in the various indicators of overall university performance. Hence universities are increasingly interested in how they can improve their competitive position in attracting, supporting and promoting the work of high-quality researchers. In times of financial stringency, however, they are also seeking to ensure that support and other services operate both efficiently and cost-effectively. In that context, this study reports on both the provision and the use of information-related support services for researchers in four research-intensive universities in the UK: Leicester, University College London (UCL), Warwick and York. It is one half of a pair of studies commissioned by the Research Information Network (RIN) in the UK and by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) in the US.1 Both studies set out to investigate what kinds of information-related services are available to support researchers through the research lifecycle, and how those services are used and valued by researchers. Both studies are limited in scope, and are subject to the limitations of small-scale case studies. Nevertheless, we hope that they offer some insights into the nature of the services provided to support researchers in their work, and the extent to which they meet researchers’ expressed needs.

The prototype\nprogram of this ITMS has been developed and then tested in an emulated\nmanufacturing environment, using CLIPS as the tool for building the\nrule-based program and Visual Basic 5 for constructing the OOVA module.\nIt is expected that the experience of developing and implementing the\nITMS may be useful for the design of the next generation of\ncollaborative agent-based systems to be adopted in a manufacturing\ninformation network. In this article, details related to the structure,\ndesign and implementation of the ITMS are covered with actual program\ncodes included. Further, a methodology for the design of the Rule-based\nInference Mechanism (RIM) is also presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science\nLtd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of this research work is to obtain the minimum number of measurements and their weights (index) in the power system network. The use of singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to find a simpler approximation that speed up the search dramatically. The SVD is used to solve the problem of minimum number of measurements placement while maintaining accuracy as well as network observability. In this paper, the weights (index) of the measurements are obtained by their effect measured by the respective relative error in state estimation. The critical and non critical measurements are identified in the system.

AB  - In order to ensure end user devices are healthy enough to gain access to the network, providers are making use of advanced network access control solutions, which propose an evaluation of configuration information (posture) about the device itself before providing access to the network. However, current solutions are focused on intra-domain scenarios, where end users and network belong to the same organization. This work proposes an architecture to provide this trusted network access control in other emerging scenarios: network roaming federations, like eduroam, where the accessed network provider is not where the end user belongs to. The paper describes how authentication and authorization mechanisms for these scenarios can be integrated to provide trusted network access control.

AB  - Characterization of rainfall variation in time and space is an indispensable part of crop monitoring for food security in Africa. In order to compensate for sparse and late- reporting rain gauge stations, early warning systems often rely upon indirect estimates of precipitation. Examples are estimates derived from satellite imagery and output fields from numerical models of the atmosphere. In order to support workshop discussions, rapid and limited comparisons of two such data sets were made against available station data for a region of western Kenya. Substantially better agreement with station data was observed for the satellite rainfall estimates than was the case with atmospheric model reanalysis fields. Though limited in scope, we believe the results are indicative of the relative performance of these two classes of indirect rainfall estimators.

AB  - Most studies of the size, growth, and distribution of cities have been\nbased on Western economies and have identified economic factors such as\nscale and agglomeration economies and level of economic development as\nmajor determinants of urban growth. It is unclear whether these\ngeneralizations are applicable in socialist economies. In this paper, I\nargue that institutional factors have played key roles in shaping\nChina's city system, which is characterized by declining population\nconcentration across cities and by tremendous vertical (population\ngrowth of cities) and horizontal (addition of new cities) expansions.\nThe empirical analysis focuses on describing the size distribution of\ncities, estimating a multivariate model predicting the population growth\nof cities, and performing a logistic regression analysis of new and\nexisting cities. The findings underscore the effects of urban and\nregional development policies, socialist institutions, changes in the\nurban administrative system, and state and local government interests,\nand suggest that they as a whole are more important than economic\nfactors in explaining the attributes and changes of China's city system.

AB  - The phenomenon of globalization has renewed interest in thinking about the place & role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (& their residents) has become increasingly tied to their position in international flows of investment & trade. While some have suggested the appropriateness of network techniques for the study of the global urban system, few have effectively realized their application. Utilizing data on the branch locations of the world's 500 largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 1981 & 2000, we employ network analytic techniques to examine change in the structure of the world city system. First, we evaluate the more than 3000 cities that are knit together in the MNE-generated city system in terms of three measures of point centrality (viz., degree, betweenness, & closeness) at both time points. Second, we use these measures to answer a series of questions regarding the development of the world city system: (1) How extensively has the structure of the world city system been altered across the era of globalization? (2) Have power & prestige in the world city system grown more concentrated? (3) Have cities been decoupled from "traditional" political geography in the course of globalization? In answering these questions, we trace out the changing structure of the world city system & address key concerns in the literature regarding its evolution.

AB  - The present study examined the influence of bilateral peripheral vestibular loss (BVL) in humans on postural responses to multidirectional surface rotations in the pitch and roll planes. Specifically, we examined the effects of vestibular loss on the directional sensitivity, timing, and amplitude of early stretch, balance correcting, and stabilizing reactions in postural leg and trunk muscles as well as changes in ankle torque and trunk angular velocity following multidirectional rotational perturbations of the support surface. Fourteen normal healthy adults and five BVL patients stood on a dual axis rotating platform which rotated 7.5 degrees at 50 degrees/s through eight different directions of pitch and roll combinations separated by 45 degrees. Directions were randomized within a series of 44 perturbation trials which were presented first with eyes open, followed by a second series of trials with eyes closed. Vestibular loss did not influence the range of activation or direction of maximum sensitivity for balance correcting responses (120-220 ms). Response onsets at approximately 120 ms were normal in tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), paraspinals (PARAS), or quadriceps muscles. Only SOL muscle activity demonstrated a 38- to 45-ms delay for combinations of forward (toe-down) and roll perturbations in BVL patients. The amplitude of balance correcting responses in leg muscles between 120 and 220 ms was, with one exception, severely reduced in BVL patients for eyes open and eyes closed conditions. SOL responses were decreased bilaterally for toe-up and toe-down perturbations, but more significantly reduced in the downhill (load-bearing) leg for combined roll and pitch perturbations. TA was significantly reduced bilaterally for toe-up perturbations, and in the downhill leg for backward roll perturbations. Forward perturbations, however, elicited significantly larger TA activity in BVL between 120 and 220 ms compared to normals, which would act to further destabilize the body. As a result of these changes in response amplitudes, BVL patients had reduced balance correcting ankle torque between 160 and 260 ms and increased torque between 280 and 380 ms compared to normals. There were no differences in the orientation of the resultant ankle torque vectors between BVL and normals, both of which were oriented primarily along the pitch plane. For combinations of backward (toe-up) and roll perturbations BVL patients had larger balance correcting and stabilizing reactions (between 350 and 700 ms) in PARAS than normals and these corresponded to excessive trunk pitch and roll velocities. During roll perturbations, trunk velocities in BVL subjects after 200 ms were directed along directions different from those of normals. Furthermore, roll instabilities appeared later than those of pitch particularly for backward roll perturbations. The results of the study show that combinations of roll and pitch surface rotations yield important spatiotemporal information, especially with respect to trunk response strategies changed by BVL which are not revealed by pitch plane perturbations alone. Our results indicate that vestibular influences are earlier for the pitch plane and are directed to leg muscles, whereas roll control is later and focused on trunk muscles.

AB  - The NF-κB/Jurkat/GFP™ cell line was specifically designed for monitoring the NF-κB signal transduction pathway in vitro in a physiologically relevant cell line. The NF-κB/Jurkat/GFP™ cells were derived from the human T lymphocyte-based Jurkat cell line. Jurkat cells were transduced with HIV-based pseudoviral particles packaged with an expression vector encoding the GFP reporter gene driven by the minimal cytomegalovirus (mCMV) promoter in conjunction with four copies of the NF-κB consensus transcriptional response element upstream of mCMV (Figure 1). Positively transduced cells were cloned by Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), and clonal populations that stably retained the proviral expression construct in Jurkat cell genomic DNA over many passages were selected. Clones that demonstrated a robust (≥ 30- fold) increase in GFP expression upon stimulation with TNF-α at 10 ng/ml for 24 hours were chosen for further development of the cell line (Figure 2). The resulting NF-κB/Jurkat/GFP™ cell line is the clonal population that exhibited the lowest background and the strongest response to TNF-α stimulation (Figure 3, page 3).

AB  - Despite the successful application of information technology to power system, there is still a lack of some application of information theory to power system. In the paper, a new concept named power system information theory is proposed to answer how to apply information theory to power system systematically. Here, decision-making for power system is treated as an information reconstructing process firstly. Then a generalized information channel model for decision-making is built, the uncertainty of probability-type information of power system is quantified, and based on a new principle for the minimization of information loss (MIL), a decision-making method in power system is proposed. The new method is applied to online topology error identification. Based upon information theory, topology error identification can be modeled by a novel optimization problem, which is much different from the traditional rule based methods. This quantified result will benefit topology error identification. Case study has been done to show the validity and efficiency of the principle and method proposed in this paper.

AB  - With an ever increasing amount of information being transmitted electronically, it is important that security be considered in every phase of local area network design and maintenance. Although much emphasis has been placed on such things as wireless networks and remote access, it is imperative that the core local area network not be overlooked. Because the wired local area network is the nervous system of an organization’s Information Systems, great care must be taken to properly secure it. This chapter begins by looking at the implications for the wired local area network infrastructure security. Next, local area network segmentation and traffic isolation will be discussed. By using segmentation and isolation, there is the increased opportunity for security boundaries. Another concept that will be discussed is the security of the local area network equipment. The local area network is only functional if the core equipment is operational, so securing equipment is an important part of any security strategy. To conclude, restriction of local area network access will be investigated and an organizational approach will be discussed. Because more and more users need access to local area network resources, there must be a way to identify and restrict who is allowed on the network and what access they are granted. In wired local area network infrastructure security, organizations must remember they are only as secure as their weakest point. By carefully considering the various aspects of the local area network security during design, these weak points can be reduced and the overall security of the network increased. Although it is impossible to be 100% secure and still be functional, by using some general guidelines to secure the wired local area network, many threats to the network can be reduced if not eliminated.

This framework offered two distinct advantages: (1) the provision of a secure agent-based management infrastructure and (2) the capability of achieving enhanced network management functionalities. In this paper, we propose two novel security schemes, namely the Visibility Domain Protection Scheme (VDPS) and the Visa Based Authentication Scheme (VBAS), for protection of management information and authentication and resource access control of management agents, respectively. These schemes seamlessly fit into the modular MASAM framework and facilitate two major security components defined in its abstract architecture. The efficiency of the two security schemes, focusing on the aspects of security and performance, is demonstrated and evaluation results are compared with the SNMPv3 standard.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

While the world continues to change rapidly, the ability to react to those changes is stymied by age old beliefs about what education should be, increasingly irrelevant expectations and mandatory assessments, and their own lack of understanding as to how these tools and these technologies fundamentally change the way they learn. Challenge as educators right now is to begin to reenvision their classrooms and their practice in order to help their students leverage these new connections and networks and, to put it bluntly, to stay relevant in their learning lives. This requires thinking deeply about the types of skills and literacies that 21st century learners will need in order to be as successful as they can be.

AB  - On-line power system analysis enables to make power mode-related decision based on information available at real time. The quality of the studies and efficiency of power system operation are closely associated with the accuracy of the power system models. Accurate and quick decision based on analysis on real time data has been necessary for making operational plan under the deregulation of power system world wide. In addition there has been phenomenal expansion of power system in India in recent times especially after introduction of Electricity Act 2003, introduction of open access and emergence of power markets through power exchanges have brought complexities in power system operation and control. Power network analysis on real time data is expected to further enhance the critical role in grid operation after proposed regulations for fixing the transmission tariff and loss apportionment. All these have necessitated power system analysis on real time conditions very accurate but based on diverse principle. In order to meet all requirements ranging from monitoring, commercial, reliability and stability angle, an attempt has been made to adopt hybrid nature of network model in real time supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system which has till date works on an integrated single network model. In this paper it is proposed for a theoretical basis of network modeling and the same is adapted in southern regional load despatch center (SRLDC) Bangalore India and analysis using energy management system (EMS) tools for the real time system. It has been shown how a systematic planning can make on-line network modeling and analysis relatively simple under complex operational requirement. Experimental results show that adaptation of on-line power management strategies can be a key tool in the hands of control engineers in the complex power system operation scenario.

The ANN in the paper is radial basis function network (RBFN), whose parameters are chosen by adaptive orthogonal least squares (adaptive OLS) algorithm, to compensate error of linear model of power system where a fixed-parameter CPSS is analyzed. The adaptive OLS algorithm is developed from the orthogonal least squares (OLS) algorithm to reduce the neural network size more efficiently. When the system condition is changed, this makes the fixed-parameter CPSS less efficient than a varied-parameter CPSS by ANN. Moreover, the adjustment of damping coefficient using the gradient descent method improves the oscillation damping.

AB  - This paper reports on research that has been performed into a Java
and CORBA based Network Management System (NMS). The research involved
the building of a prototype system which used a CORBA object abstraction
layer to model network elements with a Java-based operator interface
layered on top. The operator interface is a graphical user interface
(GUI) through which the network may be monitored and controlled. This
implies that the data displayed by the operator interface should be able
to be both viewed and edited as the operator desires. The system had to
allow for multiple distributed operator interfaces being used
simultaneously and asynchronously. One of the major issues that this
work focussed on was the mechanism by which the operator interfaces
would be able to maintain consistency between the data displayed by the
distributed operator interfaces while still providing efficient read and
write access to the data. An overview of the NMS architecture is
described initially, before focussing on the high level requirements of
the work that was done. The design and implementation of the approach
that was adopted is then explained and discussed in the context of the
requirements. A prototype implementation of the architecture using the
approach was developed for a simple SDH application. This paper
discusses the efficiency of the approach as it is implemented in the
prototype and the areas where the design can be extended. The paper
concludes that the approach used fulfils the defined requirements whilst
still keeping a simple, extendable architecture

AB  - Services and agencies continue to deploy IP SATCOM systems while awaiting migration to the joint IP modem (JIPM). As the JIPM nears production, challenges such as establishing responsibility for development of a common end user terminal, satellite and hub resource allocation and management, and long term sustainment for the end-to-end SATCOM infrastructure must be addressed. Currently, the DoD gateway hosts numerous IP SATCOM systems including Linkway, iDirect, and DVB-RCS. All of the SATCOM systems are responsible for providing defense information systems network (DISN) connectivity and services to the warfighter. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) aims to establish commonality and interoperability among the current capabilities. To achieve this end state, DISA is evaluating the establishment of a DISN satellite service (DSS) provided as an extension of existing IP SATCOM systems, DISN transport, and RF services embedded at the DOD gateways. As part of the DISN satellite service, DISA is designing a ubiquitous IP SATCOM suite capable of providing DISN connectivity and access to all of the DISN services including VTC, VoIP, NIPR, and SIPR. This paper will further elaborate the proposed DSS end user terminal components and capabilities and the advantages it provides to the deployed warfighter.

AB  - Along with the electric power information network system connecting into the Internet, the network and information securities are getting serious. This paper analyzes the characteristics of the electric power information network system, proposes the information network structure, and designs the security architecture of the electric power information network system. Moreover, the concrete security techniques used in the architecture are introduced in detail such as the security insulation techniques, including the physical insulation technique, the protocol insulation technique, firewall technique, VPN and VLAN technique, the security techniques of the system level, secure design strategy on the application level and other security techniques. Because an electric power system needs to send and receive secret messages frequently, an integrated encryption and digital signature algorithm is designed. These designs have applied to an electric power information network system, it is proved to be secure, reliable and practical

AB  - This paper presents a new method to solve the net- work reconfiguration problem in the presence of distributed gen- eration (DG) with an objective of minimizing real power loss and improving voltage profile in distribution system. A meta heuristic Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) is used to simultaneously re- configure and identify the optimal locations for installation of DG units in a distribution network. Sensitivity analysis is used to iden- tify optimal locations for installation of DG units. Different sce- narios of DG placement and reconfiguration of network are con- sidered to study the performance of the proposed method. The constraints of voltage and branch current carrying capacity are included in the evaluation of the objective function. The method has been tested on 33-bus and 69-bus radial distribution systems at three different load levels to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposedmethod. The results obtained are en- couraging. Index

AB  - Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are replication-deficient parvoviruses, which have traditionally required co-infection with a helper adenovirus or herpes virus for productive infection. The AAV Helper-Free System allows the production of infectious recombinant human adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV-2) virions without the use of a helper virus. The AAV Helper-Free System takes advantage of the identification of the specific adenovirus gene products that mediate AAV replication and the demonstration that these gene products can be introduced into the host cell by transfection.1 In the AAV Helper-Free System, most of the adenovirus gene products required for the production of infective AAV particles are supplied on the plasmid pHelper (i.e. E2A, E4, and VA RNA genes) that is co-transfected into cells with human AAV-2 vector DNA. The remaining adenoviral gene product is supplied by the AAV-293 host cells, which stably express the adenovirus E1 gene.2 The AAV Helper-Free System includes AAV-293 cells, which are HEK293-derived cells with improved adeno-associated virus production capabilities. By eliminating the requirement for live helper virus the AAV Helper-Free System provides a safer, purer and more convenient alternative to retroviral and adenoviral gene delivery systems.

AB  - Uninterrupted power supply is considered to be an important factor in defining a quality supply network. This becomes necessary for maintaining emergent critical load. In this paper, Multi Agent Controller (MAC) has been proposed to maintain the system operational criterions such as the maintenance of voltage and other parameters. This has been implemented in two area network to demonstrate the application of MAC where it maintains the continuity of power in the area subjected to fault. MAC is implemented by using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Simulation is carried out in Mat lab environment. Macsimjx has been used to interface the simulink model with Multi Agent System (MAS). Detailed simulation has been carried out during various fault conditions. The results demonstrate the continuity of power supply to the critical loads through Distributed Energy Resource (DER) even in absence of Grid power.

AB  - To satisfy the requirement of secure isolation of Infrastructure–as-a-Service (IaaS) for enterprise customers, virtual private clouds, which are separated from others by using virtualization technologies, are deployed. However, isolation with virtualization technologies cannot avoid the affect of performance degradation, such as traffic congestion. Therefore, bandwidth- guaranteed virtual private clouds are needed for excluding unintentional and unwanted influence among multiple customers. In this paper, we propose a sustainable network resource management system (NRM) introducing a CHAnging MEchanism of software moduLE based on the cONtext (CHAMELEON) and a virtual network point for multipoint network provisioning. With the proposed mechanisms, we successfully demonstrated the sustainability of the NRM, which controls six kinds of network equipment without any modification itself.

The two principal socioeconomic factors which contribute to the problem of drought are the policy bias of African countries towards urban areas and the role of external factors. With respect to physical factors, the author draws attention to the results of studies on urban inadvertent rainfall and suggests that mesoscale rainfall forecasters could do more accurate work by incorporating the effect of urban climate in their models. In the domain of water resources management and agricultural development, moreover, the development of urban agriculture could be encouraged downwind. Bibliogr., sum.

AB  - For the past 20 years, researches using the lens of world system theory (and other global political economy perspectives) have come to a better understanding of many of the anomalies in urbanisation patterns across more and less developed countries that had befuddled researchers whose assumptions left out global sources of social change. Recently this line of research has moved beyond regarding cities as mere objects of global forces, also theorising about their importance as lynchpins in the spatial organisation of the world economy. In this paper we review some of the scholarship that emphasises large cities’ roles as important modes of production, consumption, exchange and control at the global level; we develop the argument that systematic linkages - economic, cultural, political or social-relational - among global cities are likely to reveal the spatial organisation of the world-system; we review our position that formal network analysis provides a most promising methodological framework for analysing and mapping global intercity linkages; and we present a map of the current world city system based on our network analysis of recent air travel among many of the world’s great cities. We point out that our analysis is very preliminary and provides only a rough chart of the world city system at one point in time, and the data requirements for more detailed world city system maps for several periods of time are imposing, to say the least. Nevertheless, such a project holds the promise of revealing much about the spatial structure of our world system, how it has changed; how it is likely to change in the future; and how cities’ populations are affected by these changes. Completing the project will probably require collaboration among researchers in different countries.

AB  - Publisher Summary This chapter appraises the art of system and network configuration, which has come a long way from its humble roots in scripting of manual system administration. System configuration management is the process of maintaining the function of computer networks as holistic entities, in alignment with some previously determined policy. This policy describes how systems should behave and it is translated into a low-level configuration, informally defined as the contents of a number of specific files contained within each computer system. A typical system to be managed consists of a central-processing unit, hard disk, and associated peripherals, including network card, video card, etc. Depending upon the system, many of these components may actually be contained on a single computer board. A system typically starts its life with no operating system installed, often called “bare metal”. Configuration management is easy if one has access to unlimited hardware, and can encapsulate each distinct service on a separate machine. The complexities of configuration management arise from the need to combine or compose distinct and changing needs while utilizing limited amounts of hardware. The exact boundary between “system configuration management” andregular “system administration” is unclear, but there seems to be a solid distinction between the two at the point at which the overall configuration of a network of systems is being managed as an entity, rather than managing individual machines that contain distinct and unrelated configurations.

alleviation of voltage violations in the day-to-day operation of large
power networks. Voltage control for varying load and generation
conditions can be achieved by co-ordinated control of switchable shunt

while generator excitations are used in the dynamic control of voltage
profile. This paper deals with the development of an expert system for
voltage corrections for base case and contingency conditions using
switchable shunt reactive compensation and transformer tap settings. The
performance of the expert system is compared with the conventional
optimization technique of voltage control and concurrent results have
been obtained. The proposed expert system has been tested with simulated
conditions of a few practical power systems. Results obtained for a 24

purpose. The expert system is found to be suitable for online
application in energy control centers as the solution is obtained very

AB  - The brain is one of the most studied and highly complex systems in the biological world. It is the information center behind all vertebrate and most invertebrate life, and thus has become a major focus in current research. While many of these studies have concentrated on studying the brain directly, our focus is the structure of the brain itself: at its core an interconnected network of nodes (neurons). A better understanding of the structural aspects of the brain should elucidate some of its functional properties. In this paper we analyze the brain of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Consisting of only 302 neurons, it is one of the better-understood neural networks. Using a Laplacian matrix of the 279-neuron "giant component" of the network, we use an eigenvalue counting function to look for fractal-like self similarity. This matrix representation is also used to plot (in eigenfunction coordinates) both 2 and 3 dimensional visualizations of the neural network. Further analysis examines the small-world properties of the system, including average path length and clustering coefficient. We then test for localization of eigenfunctions, using graph energy and spacial variance. To better understand these results, all of these calculations are also performed on random networks, branching trees, and known fractals, as well as fractals which have been "rewired" to have small-world properties. This analysis is one of many stepping-stones in the research of neural networks. While many of the structures and functions within the brain are known, understanding how the two interact is also important. A firmer grasp on the structural properties of the neural network is a key step in this process

In addition, we calculate and show the transfer function that relates output signal dynamic to amplifier perturbation arising not only from channel add/drop, but also from pump power fluctuation. This allows optimum electronic circuit design and implementation of electronic feedback. The impact on a metro system of next-generation components, such as waveguide amplifiers, is reported. An experimental investigation of Er-(Yb) doped amplifiers has been performed and system experiments in a multiwavelength metro network are reported.

The HPC-M2 antibody is also shown to be multispecific in its effector function, since it lyses both phosphorylcholine coated erythrocytes, and B36-82 Fab coated red blood cells. The symmetry and multispecificity in effector function are presented as new evidence against the concept that the paratope of antibody molecule exists as a uniquely defined site on the antibody variable region. A theoretical consequence for immune system network theory is that the anti-idiotypic set and the internal image are functionally equivalent, the results support symmetric network models of regulation, and are evidence against asymmetric models.

Digital based (computer) relay systems do not circumvent, per se, wave distortion problems. Protection relays are shown to not respond to any single parameter such as the rms value or the fundamental component, of an applied signal. It is noted that there are no wave distortion performance standards nor waveform testing standards for protective relays, other than for harmonic restraint relays. This can be attributed to the lack of recognizing as a significant factor the causal relationship between relay performance and waveform distortion.

AB  - The deterministic and restricted nature of industrial control system networks sets them apart from more open networks, such as local area networks in office environments. This improves the usability of network security, monitoring approaches that would be less feasible in more open environments. One of such approaches is machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of the industrial control system network environment, many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. A machine learning based approach could reduce the amount of manual customization required for different industrial control system networks. In this paper we analyze a possible set of features to be used in a machine learning based anomaly detection system in the real world industrial control system network environment under investigation. The network under investigation is represented by architectural drawing and results derived from network trace analysis. The network trace is captured from a live running industrial process control network and includes both control data and the data flowing between the control network and the office network. We limit the investigation to the IP traffic in the traces.

AB  - Connection of a local area network to the Internet brings with it
a certain amount of risk. Once connected, local computer systems are
subject to attacks by other users on the Internet. To maintain system
integrity, system administrators need tools to accurately display the
status of communication between local hosts and remote hosts. The paper
describes an ongoing research and development project for Surveying
Network Information Flow (SNIF). The SNIF tool provides system
administrators and security officers an encapsulated view of network
communication and information flow for a set of monitored subnetworks.
The tool provides a real-time graphical interface, configurable
monitoring, alarms and signals, connection statistics, and an extensible
interface to permit links to external systems (LES). This tool is one of
many in a suite of security tools being developed at the University of

AB  - Phylogenetic methods for the analysis of species data are widely used in evolutionary studies. However, preliminary data transformations and data reduction procedures (such as a size-correction and principal components analysis, PCA) are often performed without first correcting for nonindependence among the observations for species. In the present short comment and attached R and MATLAB code, I provide an overview of statistically correct procedures for phylogenetic size-correction and PCA. I also show that ignoring phylogeny in preliminary transformations can result in significantly elevated variance and type I error in our statistical estimators, even if subsequent analysis of the transformed data is performed using phylogenetic methods. This means that ignoring phylogeny during preliminary data transformations can possibly lead to spurious results in phylogenetic statistical analyses of species data.

AB  - With the almost ubiquitous availability of wireless communication networks and the increasing communication capabilities of electronic devices, the prediction that most devices are constantly connected to the Internet is fast becoming a reality. Furthermore, the speed of the wireless networks is increasing at a fast rate. In a vehicular environment, passengers and vehicular sensors can access services in the Internet by utilizing a mobile network architecture which connects the vehicular network to the Internet through heterogeneous of a mobile network architecture using mobile routers, e.g. the NEMO architecture, allows the devices within the vehicle to connect to a vehicular wired or wireless local area network. The mobile router can then forward data between the local area network and the Internet using multiple access networks, external antennas outside the vehicle, and higher transmission power. These characteristics of the NEMO architecture increase the number of connectivity options to the devices connected to the vehicular network, thus increasing the available bandwidth and decreasing the cost of communications. However, the long latency of handoffs, and the overheads of the protocols involved in NEMO may limit the benefits and applicability of a NEMO based architecture. This chapter presents a mobile network architecture which addresses the handoff delays and protocol overheads of NEMO. The feasibility of the architecture is evaluated by comparing its performance with state of the art proposals using both analytical and empirical data.

System Network will most likely operate in a large environment with
diversified policies. The author proposes a policy based routing
architecture that would be a good candidate for this type of

source routing, path establishment, and encapsulation, and proposes
changes and new features that would circumvent the shortcomings of IDPR.
IDPR II eliminates the scaling problem by simplifying expression and
distribution of policies. It reduces complexity and provides capability
to handle a rich set of dynamically changing policies by eliminating the
notion of virtual gateways and a virtual gateway protocol. It adds
flexibility and robustness by providing both hop-by-hop and source route

Among the priorities that it identified for attention was the need for the exchange of information and experience, particularly with regards to the preventive and early diagnosis programmes of the Member States. Such initiatives were reinforced with the establishment of the ‘Europe Against Cancer’ (EAC) programme, which included a branch of secondary prevention, i.e. systematic population-based screening for specific sites of cancer where such interventions had been judged to be effective.2 Acknowledging that some Member States were already considering a national breast screening programme, a plan was developed to enable each of the twelve Member States of the European Community to propose a pilot-screening project within its borders. The European Breast Screening Network (EBSN) thus created has now been in existence for more than a decade. The majority of its screening programmes have progressed through their implementation phases, have introduced continuing quality improvement procedures, and now have entered the phase of programme evaluation.

Comparison of the north part of the Chinese national grid and the west state power grid in U.S. shows that the Chinese power gird is also a small-world. Then the achievements in collective dynamics of small-world networks are used to advance the analysis of cascading failure in power systems. We firstly analyze node failure and line breakdown respectively, and then proposed a Monte-Carlo simulation process to search root causes of cascading failure of Northern Chinese Power Grid. Simulation results show that cascading failure is high correlation to the statistical characters of these networks, especially the degree of the initial attack points and the character shortest path length of the restructured network after each step of components out of service, which are critical nodes and critical lines of the network. Historical statistical data of Chinese power system also shows similar rule of the existence of critical points in the networks.

AB  - The determination of power system network topology for off-line studies is a relatively simple problem since one-line diagrams inherently describe system configuration. In real time environments, system configuration is dynamic. Breakers may operate at any time producing some of the following effects: 1) circuits may or may not be disconnected, 2) substations may or may not separate possibly forming new nodes, thus varying the total number of nodes in a system, and 3) an interconnected system may split into several separated areas. Unless provisions are made to automatically incorporate in real time the effects of breaker operations on system topology, any calculation and decision based on a wrong configuration would be dangerous, especially when most needed: immediately after the occurrence of the abnormality ity which lead to breaker operations.

desired information is delivered to a user of the communications
service. In these days of overwhelming digital information broadcast via
numerous wide-area networks including the Internet and corporate
intranets, the ability of an individual user to obtain relevant, needed
information is becoming increasingly difficult. Information filtering
systems perform a data extraction function, analyzing an incoming stream
of information and selecting information that matches the needs of its
users. Inclusion of an information filtering mechanism in the
communications system ensures that the desired information is delivered
to a user. Currently, information filtering systems are based on
proprietary implementations that are not easily moved to other
platforms, do not readily scale for larger volumes of information, and
cannot be easily modified to handle new forms of data. This paper
presents an overview of the work we have done using the relational
database model to implement an information filtering system. We describe
the prototype information filtering system we have developed and its
initial system accuracy and performance measurements. Use of the

While many scholars suggest that the broader parameters of the world system structure the urban hierarchy embedded within or articulated to it, others argue that the urban hierarchy is decoupling from the world system. The analyses show that there has been some modest convergence in the distribution of power in the world city system. Moreover, they suggest that the mechanism for this convergence is the upward mobility of cities located in the semi-periphery and the east Asian region. The paper closes by considering the implication of these findings for a larger understanding of the relationship between globalisation, the structure of the world city system and its articulation with the world system.

AB  - The operational safety of electric systems is regularly highlighted by TSOs as an essential consideration to be taken into account to facilitate as much as possible the development and the effectiveness of the European electricity markets. However, the efforts TSOs have already done and are in the process of doing as regards market access have to be accompanied by enhanced coordination between TSOs to guarantee the operational safety of the interconnected system. The weaknesses of inter-TSO coordination are well known: no global, region-wide visibility, segmented security analyses, different security analysis models hampering joint security analyses, the lack of global assessment of coordinated remedial actions, and so on. As a consequence there is no quick, coordinated action to deal with congestions caused by unexpected events affecting the power system. This fragmented vision of each TSO to its own grid appears to be one of the main root causes of recent disturbances in Europe (September 2003 and November 2006). In the same time, the operational environment is changing and European TSOs have to combine successfully 3 major stakes that are: - the operational safety of the power system, - the insertion of a large part of renewable generation, specially wind generation, - the development of the electricity market. To provide relevant responses to two main stakes mentioned above, some TSOs support the idea to improve the coordination with a much more ambitious response, to meet the need for improved security of supply and to ensure credibility for their approach. The organisational model proposed to satisfy operational security concerns is based on the creation of a dedicated coordination centre, bringing together the technical resources and skills. The objectives of this centre are: - to build and to provide to the TSOs a common and broader view of the power system, by merging together national files in UCTE wide files, in different time frames (D-1, intra-day, real time), - to perform security analysis on these UCTE wide files, by simulating N-k contingencies on the base cases or taken into account variants of different parameters such as wind power generation, commercial exchanges between countries, to evaluate cross-border impact between the grids, and assess the security of a broader area of the grid (not only a national one), - to propose to the TSOs the implementation of optimised and coordinated remedial actions required to master these risks (network topology, generation values⋯). Coreso (Coordination of Electricity System Operators), first regional technical coordination centre shared by several TSOs, was incorporated on the 18th of December 2008 by RTE and Elia, respectively the French and Belgian power transmission system operators (TSOs). The paper develops: - the presentation of Coreso, - the way Coreso performs its security assessments (data, software⋯), - the main results and lessons learned after a couple of months of activity: how Coreso contributes to enhance the security of the CWE grid and to promote an efficient, secure and sustainable integration of renewable generation, - the questions raised by the experience of working in such an organisation with the TSOs.

The important issues in this stage are to determine the restoration sequence of target nodes, and to optimize the restoration paths for the node restoration sequence. Both of the two issues are considered as a whole in this paper. Some electrical indexes, such as line operating time, line operating costs, and cranking unit number, are introduced to reflect the electrical characteristics of power system network. At the same time, based on the topological characteristics of power system network, a topological index, node importance degree is introduced here to solve the optimization problem. Meanwhile, the classic Dijkstra algorithm and the genetic algorithm are employed to search the global optimal restoration sequence of target nodes and node restoration paths. The numerical tests on the IEEE 30 system validates the strategy proposed in this paper.

AB  - Power Line Communication (PLC) is an evolving communication network technology using the existing power lines and enables to provide the automatic meter reading service, high-speed Internet service as well as home networking service. As the use of PLC network and their applications increase, we need to manage the resources of PLC networks efficiently. Major PLC chipset and modem vendors are trying to provide network management solutions, but they are only specific solutions. It is necessary to provide a general PLC network management solution for PLC networks comprised of PLC devices from heterogeneous vendors. In this paper, we propose a PLC network management system called i-NetMSuite4PLC. We also propose a common PLC MIB (Management Information Base) based on some existing PLC MIBs. We present the design and implementation of the system.

The L-index provides an online mechanism for computing and rating the status of the interconnected system into the utility-supplied, pre-microgrid, microgrid-supplied and island operational modes for improved operation. It may also provide a triggering signal to control the point of common coupling (PCC) converter to reduce network voltage violations in situations where the MG system has the capability to inject reactive power to the grid during periods of emergency or peak loads. Simulation results obtained with IEEE 14 bus system with MG later connected to load bus twelve as a PCC to the microgrid system, showed the suitability of the developed model towards providing smooth operation under both normal and distressed conditions.

We present a new database that covers all actual cities as well as potential city locations over the period when the foundations for the European city system were laid. We relate each location’s urban chances to its physical, first nature, geography characteristics, and develop a novel empirical strategy to assess how the existing urban system surrounding each location (second nature geography) determines its urban prospects. First nature geography is the dominant determinant of city location until the sixteenth century. Second nature geography becomes important from the seventeenth century onwards, in a way that corresponds closely to predictions from new economic geography theory.

In the paper, the original small world network model has been modified in two ways. Firstly, the magnitude of the line impedance regarded as the weight of edges is taken into consideration which is not considered in the original model. The formulae of corresponding parameters of the model are also modified. The calculation results of some practical grids validate the correctness and effectiveness of the new model. Secondly, the complex number format of power flow is introduced as the network flow in the small world model. With the power flow and the topology of grids, the two main factors to the system vulnerability, considered, the improved small world model can be used as a tool for vulnerability analysis of grids.

AB  - This article formulates a transit network design model for determining frequencies of each transit line in a network. This transit network design model requires a mode-split assignment model with distinct transit lines, each with its own specified frequency, to capture the mode split effects of increases or decreases in individual transit line frequencies. It is shown how to refine conventional mode-split assignment models to include this feature. The resulting model includes more precise measures of transit access and transfer delays, so that it more accurately predicts mode choices and link flows. This variation of the mode-split assignment model uses Dial's transit loader to solve Frank-Wolfe subproblems, using frequencies of individual transit lines to find fastest transit paths, considering access time, ride time, and any transfer delays. Computational shortcuts using the standard Hooke-Jeeves algorithm are demonstrated.

AB  - An integrated network security system is provided which permits log-on to a normally locked client on the network in response to at least one coded non-public input to the client by a user. At least a selected portion of the coded input is encrypted and sent to a network server where the user is authenticated. After authentication, the server preferably returns a decryption key, an encryption key for future use and any critical files previously stored at the server to the client. The decryption key is utilized to decrypt any material at the client which were encrypted when the client was locked, including any material sent from the server, thereby unlocking the client. The decryption key may be combined with untransmitted portions of the original coded input in a variety of ways to generate an encryption key for the next time the terminal is to be locked. When one of a variety of client locking conditions occurs, the previously generated encryption key is utilized to encrypt at least selected critical material at the client. Critical directories or the like in encrypted form may be sent to the server and a message is sent to the server that the client is locked, which message is utilized by the server to inhibit the client from further access to at least selected resources on the network.

Furthermore, a general criterion to map functionalities to system and network models is presented. As a case study, the proposed methodology is applied to the design of a Voice-over-IP client.

AB  - In recent years, cellular networks have become open public networks to which end subscribers have direct access. This has greatly increased the number of threats to cellular networks. Though cellular networks have vastly advanced in their performance abilities, the security of these networks still remains highly outdated. As a result, they are one of the most insecure networks today – so much so, that using simple off-the-shelf equipment, any adversary can cause major network outages affecting millions of subscribers. In this chapter, we address the security of cellular networks. We also educate readers on the current state of security of cellular networks and their vulnerabilities. In addition, we outline a cellular network specific attack taxonomy–also called the three-dimensional attack taxonomy. Furthermore, we also discuss the vulnerability assessment tools for cellular networks. Finally, we provide insights as to why cellular networks are so vulnerable and why securing them can prevent communication outages during emergencies.

A network can be defined using several levels of definition (detail) following the importance of the nodes (resp. the edges) within an application. The object-oriented concepts are applied to the alphanumerical data part and to model the topology of the graph. The data manipulation operators are basic operators.

AB  - Historically, tuition and mandatory fee rates of all North Dakota University System (NDUS) institutions (except the 2-year campuses) have been less than their regional counterparts. Average tuition and fee increases at NDUS institutions were significantly higher than their regional counterparts in 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, as a result, the gap between tuition and fee rates at all NDUS institutions, except the 2-year campuses, and their regional counterparts has narrowed significantly in recent years. At the 2-year campuses the gap has widened significantly since 2003-04 with NDUS two-year campus tuition and fee rates, on the average, about $660 more than their regional counterparts. Funding for the needs based state grant program has not kept pace with tuition increases and has declined as a percent of estimated tuition collections, from 2.19 percent of estimated annual tuition collections in 1989-91 to 1.82 percent in 2007-09.

Based on the individual local searching the artificial fish-swarm algorithm (AFSA) is an up-to-date proposed optimal strategy, which possesses good capability to avoid the local extremum and obtain the global extremum. Here, a new artificial neural network (ANN) based forecasting model using AFSA is built in which the weights of ANN are trained by AFSA, then the neural network using AFSA is applied to short term load forecasting. Applying the presented forecasting method to a certain actual power network it is shown that comparing with traditional BP neural network forecasting method the presented forecasting method has better adaptive ability and can give better forecasting result.

AB  - We propose a network management system which is suitable to disaster situation in U-city environment. U-city is a smart city with the intelligent convergence system that integrates IT technology and urban engineering technology such as environment, road traffic, safe and GIS. The network used in U-city should provide services without transmission failure and support functionality which enlarges the role of sensors used to collect information. Thus, a network management system which manages user's information is necessary. SNMP is the most widely used management protocol standard on the internet. But it manages a network has a static topology and the number of devices which are managed is small. To overcome SNMP problems, we propose an ubiquitous network management system (uNMS) that mobile devices in it is suitable in mobile network which go in and out U-city frequently and can manage lots of agents. And uNMS minimizes a usage of bandwidth. As shown in simulation results overheads are decreased about 40% and the connectivity is increased about 14%. When the mobility of mobile agents increases, the connectivity is 30% higher than SNMP.

AB  - A power system is continually subjected to external and internal
disturbances that are capable of causing instability in the system. The
process of determining the stability of the system following the
disturbances is known as security assessment. In particular, dynamic
security assessment evaluates the stability of the power system with the
time-dependent transition from pre-fault to post-fault states taken into
consideration. For large disturbances, critical clearing time is a
measure of the stability of the power system. The critical clearing time
is a complex function of many variables, and its determination using
conventional methods such as numerical integration is generally a time
consuming and computationally intensive task. As an alternative
approach, the artificial neural network is used in this paper to predict
the critical clearing time. In particular, a multilayered feedforward
neural network with error backpropagation algorithm was used to predict
the critical clearing time of 2 different electric power systems; a 2
machine 5 bus system and a 3 machine 8 bus system. For the former power
system, the optimal result of a percentage mean absolute error of 0.6%
was obtained with a neural network structure of 1 hidden layer, 18
hidden neurons and the logistic activation function. The larger system
had an optimal result of percentage mean absolute error of 2% with a
neural network structure of 3 hidden layers, 30 hidden neurons and the
logistic activation function

AB  - Due to the increasing of power system fault and failure, voltage sag (dip) will occur instantaneously with respect to the fault and failure itself. The power system network consists of high voltage (HV), medium voltage (MV) and low voltage busbar (LV). Monitoring equipment in the power systems network are installed at strategic and appropriate 33/11 kV feeder. The propagation and the travelling of voltage sag from one busbar to another busbar can't be recorded in each part of the power system network. This paper has been written to investigate the propagation of voltage sag from one busbar to the other busbar through transformer connections due to power system faults. Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD/EMTDC) will be used to construct and simulate a power system model network. The results of this work later will be used to develop an empirical rule for the propagation of voltage sag in power system network. It is hoped that the empirical rule can be used for an example planning for voltage sag mitigation in the power system networks and monitoring purposes.

Data on the branch locations of the worlds 500 largest multinational enterprises in 2000 are subjected to two broad types of network analytic tech- niques in order to analyze the world city system. First, 3,692 cities are analyzed in terms of three measures of point centrality. Second, blockmodeling techniques are employed to generalize further about the positions and roles played by cities in the system. These tech- niques are used to trace out the structure of the world city system, locate cities in the context of a global urban hierarchy, and explore the degree to which this diverges from a simple one-to-one matching of cities onto nation-states in the world system.

AB  - Protocol reverse engineering, the process of (re)constructing the protocol context of communication sessions by an implementation, which involves translating a sequence of packets into protocol messages, grouping them into sessions, and modeling state transitions in the protocol state machine, is well-known to be invaluable for many network security applications, including intrusion prevention and detection, traffic normalization, and penetration testing, etc. However, current practice in deriving protocol specifications is either mostly manual or focusing on automatic reverse engineering the message format only and leaving the protocol state machine inverse undone. Although regular expressions offer superior expressive ability and flexibility, application protocols are described by regular expression manually based on sufficiently understanding protocol itself. At present there is not an effect method to realize classification, recognition and control automatically for the known applications and the unknown applications in future. In this paper a novel approach is presented to model network application specification. In this work, the whole automatic protocol reverse engineering is realized through accomplishing the protocol state machine, and then the FSMs are translated to corresponding regular expressions to enrich and update the pattern database. This approach uses grammatical inference and is motivated by the observation that an implementation of the protocol is inherently a state transition process, the state machine model the essence exactly. The important significance is to describe various state protocols with a common method through modeling the protocol state transition, including known and unknown ones. This approach had been implemented in the system and evaluated using real-world implementations of three different protocols: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and compared the extracted protocol to the corresponding other newly system, such as 17-filter.

EAG corresponds to an equipment of the electric power system such as a bus, a transformer and a transmission line, while SBAG is a pseudo-object which consists of neighboring circuit breakers and disconnecting switches. The proposed multi-agent system realizes appropriate switching operations by interacting with neighboring agents. Computer tests on a model system show that the proposed approach is effective and promising.

AB  -  In modern power systems, it is important to analyze many dynamic phenomena which appear on the system when the usefulness of new power electronic based apparatus protective relay systems and others is verified, for which a real-time power system simulator is becoming a very effective means. In general, however, it is very expensive and it is very difficult for beginners to understand how to use it. Therefore, studies on low-cost and easy-use real-time power system simulators have so far been done. We have developed models of power system components for the real-time power system simulator using DSP (digital signal processor) combined with commercial CAD (computer aided design) software "MATLAB/SIMULINK". The use of commercial software can drastically decrease the development cost of the simulator. In this paper, a simplified reduction model of a transmission network consisting of unbalanced three phase transmission line with mutual impedance is proposed for reducing computing time for the transmission network of the digital simulator.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to educate both IT staff and senior management for small-medium sized businesses (SMB’s) as to the network security threats that exist. The paper presents a digest of industry best practices for network security, which will hopefully assist SMB’s in setting priorities for securing the perimeter of a typical SMB network. The security industry does a good job of publicizing security threats on a continual basis. However, much of what we read in the press contains little if any context associated with each new security threat that can assist senior management or IT staff of the SMB’s in determining which threats to address, and in what priority order. This paper will seek to bridge this gap, by providing guidance to companies who, faced with the seemingly impossible and endless task of securing their network, need help deciding where to start, and where to focus- what to do first, second, third, and so on, among the myriad of information security threats that are out there, and possible solutions.

AB  - It is broadly recognized in the aerospace industry, as well as many others, that organizations which effectively execute development projects to meet desired cost, schedule, and performance targets for their customers produce higher levels of customer satisfaction and also a significant source of competitive advantage. Continually meeting the needs of the customer through effective project execution allows a company to become a preferred supplier favored in source selection for follow-on contracts and new development projects necessary for business growth. This research effort examines one aerospace company, which has multiple, diverse development projects on-going at any one time across several business units. The motivation for this thesis is to explore the product/system development capacity of the enterprise by analyzing the historical program performance of major projects, understanding the level of problem projects or fire fighting within the project pipeline, and the perceived causes of poor project performance. In addition, system dynamics models are developed to analyze the dynamics associated with project planning and resource planning strategies for both multi-project and single project scenarios. This analysis provides insight into the potential for project pipeline "tipping" and the effects of various project management and resource planning strategies in an aerospace product/system development context. Such analysis is believed to provide greater insight and opportunity to improve the product/system development performance for the enterprise.

AB  -  This work proposes a methodology and a practical tool for the study of long-term network planning under uncertainties. In this approach the major external uncertainties during the planning horizon are modeled as macroscenarios at different future time instants. On the other hand, the random nature of actual operating conditions is taken into account by using a probabilistic model of microscenarios based on past statistics. Massive Monte-Carlo simulations are used to generate and simulate a large number of scenarios and store the detailed results in a relational database. Data mining techniques are then applied to extract information from the database so as to rank scenarios and network reinforcements according to different criteria.

AB  - Electric power system network planning is influenced by the uncertainty in many parameters, such as future customer-demand/fossil-fuel-price parameter projections and new generation plant locations, which can generally be modeled in an approximate or subjective manner at best. Historically recorded wind power data presented here supports the contention that medium-term wind power generation profiles tend to follow more stable probability distributions. While it is widely acknowledged that the addition of wind power to a system makes network investment analysis more difficult in some respects, such data patterns nevertheless evoke an important discussion on how this relatively more probabilistic (i.e. not uncertain) characteristic of wind power may have some positive value for transmission planning and its related decision making procedures.

As the numbers of information available increases, there are more inadequate and junk information which consume efforts and time for information search and sharing. In order to support personalized social network services, there are technical and service oriented requirements for managing and providing accumulative experiences of social users according to their own knowledge and life-style. Such social network services generally implements a recommendation system that provides services based on user history and profiles including statistics information for service customization. Therefore there is probability of producing irrelevant information results because of the fact that the conventional recommendation system does not consider to support a dynamic generation of the context information of users.

AB  - Power line communication (PLC) is an evolving communication network technology using pre-installed power lines, which provides the electricity to the household or the building, in order to provide services such as Internet access, Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) and home networking. As PLC networks and their applications grow with the advances in PLC technologies, we need to efficiently manage the resources of PLC networks. Currently, major PLC chipset and modem vendors are trying to provide network management capabilities in their devices by defining their own private management information base (MIB). However, it is insufficient to manage PLC networks comprised of multi-vendor PLC devices using a proprietary MIB. In this paper, we present our work on integrated network management of multi-vendor PLC networks. Particularly, we have focused on two aspects: 1) defining a common PLC MIB, the common management information for all types of PLC devices and 2) providing Integrated PLC Management System (IPMS). Our work can be used as a guideline for an international standardization for PLC network management.

First, Tabu search is applied to optimize set of the weighting matrices Q and R over their wide range of operating conditions. Second, a radial basis function (RBF) neural network with orthogonal least square learning is used to adapt feedback gains, which correspond with Riccati equation. The proposed method AOPSS is illustrated with application to design of stabilizer for a single generator connected to an infinite bus under various disturbances. The eigenvalue analysis and the time domain simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed AOPSS to improve damping characteristics and to enhance the system stability over wide range of loading conditions. Moreover, AOPSS gives better performance than conventional stabilizer and adaptive conventional stabilizer.

To overcome the drawbacks of conventional PSS (CPSS), numerous techniques have been proposed in the literature. Based on the analysis of existing techniques, this paper presents an indirect adaptive neural network based power system stabilizer (IDNC) design. The proposed IDNC consists of a neuro-controller, which is used to generate a supplementary control signal to the excitation system, and a neuro-identifier, which is used to model the dynamics of the power system and to adapt the neuro-controller parameters. The proposed method has the features of a simple structure, adaptivity and fast response. The proposed IDNC is evaluated on a single machine infinite bus power system under different operating conditions and disturbances to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

AB  - Literacy is examined from the viewpoint of systemic linguistics. It is proposed that "literacy" means intervening in the social processes by working with written language, and this can not be accomplished by an individual alone. "Using written language" can not be isolated from "using language." While sociologically, it may make sense to treat literacy as a thing in itself, linguistically, it does not. Writing may have its own grammar, discourse semantics, and genres, but everyone who writes, speaks; and the primary context of writing is speaking. All ideologies in literate cultures are the product of both; not the sum of the two, but the dialectic between them. At this level, it makes little sense to treat literacy and oracy separately; the concept needed is that of "articulacy," or making meaning by using text in context.

AB  - Harmonics in HVDC power systems caused by highly non-linear devices affect its performance. Controlling and eliminating such harmonics have been a great concern of power engineers in power system design and operation. The HVDC power system harmonic analysis is, therefore, essential in power system planning, control, and operation. The two main mathematical approaches in power system harmonic study are the time-domain analysis and the frequency-domain solution. The former is suitable for studying phenomena including non- linearity, switching operations, long-time simulations, and control systems. The latter, on the other hand, is appropriate for studying phenomena such as frequency dependence, system equivalents, and frequency response. This paper discusses the time and frequency domain methods in the HVDC power system harmonic analysis. It reviews the sources of HVDC system harmonics. The paper also reveals the advantages and disadvantages of the methods and points out their suitable applications in power network harmonic computations.

AB  - This chapter presents a state of the art of the management of ad-hoc networks. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-organizing network that can be spontaneously deployed by a set of mobile devices (laptops, phones, personal assistants) without requiring a fixed network infrastructure. Ad-hoc networks are a potential solution for the increasing need of mobility and ubiquitous computing. These self-configuring networks are spontaneously deployed by a set of heterogeneous nodes of various capacities and resources, without requiring any preexisting infrastructure. The dynamic and distributed nature of ad-hoc networks raises new challenges towards monitoring and controling them. From an organizational point of view, several models can be considered for the purposes of ad-hoc network management. The recent standardization of ad-hoc routing protocols clarifies the context of ad-hoc networking for defining management approaches. The traditional classification defines five FCAPS functional areas: fault, configuration, accounting, performance, and security. Fault management is not a well-covered area. Issues related to observability are challenging: fault management can be hindered by the impossibility to observe a given node in ad-hoc networks. The constraints of future networks may reverse the tendency: all the optimization approaches defined for ad-hoc networking could be applied to the networks of the future. The growing dynamics of these ones might generate an edge network management crisis.

AB  - The development of distribution networks for participation in active network management (ANM) and smart grids is introduced using the microgrid concept. In recent years, this issue has been researched and implemented by many experts. The second part of this paper describes those developed operational concepts of microgrids that have an impact on their participation in ANM and in the requirements for achieving targets. Power quality is the most challenging task in microgrids, especially when the system switches from normal parallel operation (grid-connected mode) to island operation. Indeed, following planned or unplanned transitions to island mode, microgrids may develop instability. For this reason, the paper addresses the principles behind island-detection methods, black-start operation, fault management, and protection systems, along with a comprehensive review of power quality. Finally, island detection and the other topics are summarized with a flowchart and tables. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  -  Nowadays, power harmonic problems have attracted more attention in power systems. Traditional technical tools for harmonic distortion analysis using either FFT or DFT are, however, susceptible to the presence of noise and sub-harmonics in the distorted signals. In this paper, an alternative method using back propagation neural network algorithm has achieved satisfactory results for dynamic harmonic distortion analysis in noisy environments. Sensitivity considerations are also conducted to determine the key factors affecting the performance efficiency of the proposed model to reach the lowest errors of testing patterns.

Power quality phenomena are short-time problems and of many varieties. Particularly, the transients happen during very short durations to the nano- and microsecond. Thus, a method for detecting and classifying transient signals at the same time and in an automatic way is recommended. The proposed wavelet network (WN) combines the properties of the wavelet transform and the advantages of neural networks. Especially, the additional feature extraction to improve the recognition rate is considered. The configuration of the hardware of WN (PQ-DAS) and some case studies are described.

AB  - Neural networks have been applied in various new ways to the manifold problems in power systems. The great majority of neural network designs attempt to model a dynamic mapping with one neural network. Recently, attempts have been made at using system-type neural networks for distributed parameter systems, where the system dynamics is distributed over a spatial-temporal domain. In this paper, system-type neural networks is illustrated, which are designed using semigroup theory. The objective will be either to achieve extrapolation of functional patterns along one axis, or to achieve a forecasting of functional patterns in multiple axes.

AB  - The paper argues that systems analysis provides an invaluable frame for many aspects of urban studies. Two uses of the systems approach are identified. First, there is the use of the approach to conceptualize the phenomenon of study such that the researcher's emphasis is on the nature of the interrelationships of the objects and the attributes of the system of interest on the one hand, and the study of subsystems of interest within an interacting whole, on the other. Secondly, there is the use of the systems approach to generate appropriate methodological tools for the analysis and description of urban spatial and functional structure. For these uses of the system approach, the concept of entropy, introduced from both thermodynamics and information theory, plays a significant role. Empirically, the concept is used to generate interaction patterns of the journey to work subsystem in Jos, Benue Plateau State, Nigeria, while certain indices of information theory entropy are used to unravel the nature and structure of these flows or movements of people. It emerges that the concept of entropy can be used in studies of urban spatial structure as an integrating concept provided that our terms are defined explicitly and unambiguously. © 1976.

AB  - Demonstrates the application of the immune system reaction network
concept to sequential control, by determining control sequences of
sequential control plants that can be modeled by a sub-class of Petri
nets with modular modeling characteristics, defined as PI*-net. The
determination of control sequences of a sequential control plant modeled
by Petri nets is equivalent to the determination of firing sequences of
these models. We propose an approach for finding firing sequences based
on the immune system response mechanism, which differs substantially
from conventional enumerative methods. The firing sequence problem is
reformulated by decomposing it into several smaller sub-problems, the
model itself is divided into several sub-models and local firing
sequences that will compose the original model firing sequence are
selected by interacting common transitions of these sub-models, through
local objective functions. Local objective functions are set dynamically
by internal and inter sub-problems interactions, based on the immune
system response regulatory model. Simulations demonstrated the validity
and promising performance of the proposed approach

AB  - Full deregulation would allow bilateral contracts between the
suppliers and the buyers. This concept, however, leads to the confusion
of transmission loss sharing and generation of the reactive power. Two
methods, incremental load flow approach (ILFA) and marginal transmission
loss approach (MTLA), have been developed to determine a generator's
share of transmission loss in a fully deregulated power system. ILFA is
very simple and employs the load flow technique in an iterative way.
MTLA is basically a mathematical modeling of the transmission losses
based on Kron's loss formula in a fully deregulated network. It
calculates marginal increase in transmission loss due to an increase in
load. These methods along with some numerical results have been

AB  - Tele-care system has been regarded as one of important industry in the future. This study tends to integrate many functions in long-distance care system through the Web services. For instance, integrating wireless measuring instruments and information systems helps patients in hospitals or at home to have access to complete care. When patients rest at home or do activities outside, measuring instruments may monitor their basic physiological status through the wireless transmission equipment. If an exception occurs, measuring instruments may issue a warning signal to remind, or inform the relatives and friends and even health care centers through Internet automatically in order to save time. Moreover, when patients have to get in hospitals or process online interview, doctors may use the daily recorders to identify or discuss. This study uses physiological monitoring chips to measure status; now the chip can measure body temperatures, respirations and ECG physiological information. The final studies have shown questions of the hidden nodes, exposed nodes and access points. To simulate the experiment, this experiment used NS2 (Network Simulator Version 2) simulation software. As a result, the performance of network service nodes will be affected by the mode of nodes-operation.

AB  - Power system operation aims, in principle, at maintaining reliable and secure supply of electricity while minimizing the total cost of operation. In theory, there are two main objectives that could be considered, namely the maximization of system security and the minimization of total operating cost of supplying energy. In practice, however, the security requirements are included as constraints rather than formulating the problem as a security maximization mandate. The system security constraints are in fact boundaries that surround all possible operating modes (scenarios) of the power system. In other words, these boundaries form the feasible operating domain in the parameter space spanned by various operating variables within which the system can safely be operated. For a given operating scenario, the associated security level is measured by the "distance" (for example, the Euclidean norm) of the operating point from the security region boundary. This paper presents a novel framework for identification and representation of operating security regions in power systems as well as evaluation of security levels associated with different operating scenarios. While the concepts and principles presented are general, the work of this the paper is confined to the interpretation of the security boundary in terms of system stability criteria. Of course, the framework presented is applicable quite as well to other criteria that may be considered.

The central information management system branches to the second level, which contains decision making support, production monitoring, total quality control and process safety management. On the third level, reporting to production monitoring, appears productivity management, energy management, process control and process optimization. According to the specific range of activities of every organization, each system on the third level will open a pyramid of subsystems until reaching plant floor, laboratory, research or administrative activities.

AB  - The word ‘ganyu’ is widely used in Malawi to describe a range of short-term rural labour relationships, the most common of which is piecework weeding or ridging on the fields of other smallholders, or on agricultural estates. Ganyu is a crucial poverty issue in Malawi because: • After own-farm production, ganyu is the most important source of livelihood for most poor households – for some it is becoming even more important than own-farm production. • Ganyu is the most important coping strategy for most poor households in the crucial hungry period between food stores running out and the next harvest. • The need to do ganyu to obtain an immediate supply of food may conflict with own-farm production and therefore, while addressing an immediate crisis, can lock some households into a vicious cycle of food insecurity. • Low ganyu wage rates mean agricultural labourers do not earn sufficient incomes to invest in sustainable livelihood development. Despite the widespread practice of ganyu, and its importance to the poor, it is an under-researched component of the jigsaw that makes up the livelihoods of rural Malawians. This is a mistake, as ganyu is too important to the poor to be sidelined – it will play a critical role in future rural development strategies and has important interactions with the current debate about developing safety nets in Malawi. The paper discusses recent literature on ganyu and opens up a debate about various future scenarios and how different strategies may affect rural labour markets.

AB  - The fuse is the most common and widely used protective device in electrical circuits. Though the “fuseless” concept has been catching on for quite some time, quite a lot of low voltage distribution circuits are protected with fuses. Fuses form a major backup protection in medium-voltage and high-voltage distributions up to 11 kV where switches and contactors with limited short-circuit capacities are used. All fuses irrespective of the type have inverse characteristics. Inverse means that the fuses can withstand their nominal current rating almost indefinitely but as the current increases, their withstanding time starts decreasing making them “blow.” The blowing time decreases as the flowing currents increase. The fuses blow in case the currents flowing through them last for more than their withstand time. This property limits the use of fuses in circuits where the inrush currents are quite high. Hence it is not possible to use fuses as overload protection in such circuits, because it may be necessary to select higher-rated fuse to withstand inrush currents. Accordingly the fuses are mostly used as short-circuit protection rather than as overload protection in such circuits.

AB  - Power system automations technologies are essential for power system operations and controls. A variety of communication systems including optical fiber, microwave and power line communications are used to transmit these EMS/SCADA data. In these communication modes, fiber communication is used to transmit IEC 101/104 protocol data in most power grids due to its large bandwidth and high reliability. However, fiber is very fragile when large natural disasters happen. Earthquake, snow-ice strike, hurricane would probably destroy the infrastructures of the fiber systems. In some tough geographical areas such as mountainous West Sichuan Plateaus, the construction and operation of fiber communications are very costly and difficult. After 2008 5.12 Sichuan Earthquake Sichuan Electric Power Corporations started to investigate some alternative communication systems against natural disasters. Compared to traditional fiber communications, VSAT communication (Very Small Aperture Terminal for satellite communications) has 3 advantages: (1) The setup of a VSAT station is convenient and flexible. (2) The VSAT system is robust against natural disasters since it does not need wired cable or fiber. (3) The setup and operation of VSAT system is cost effective in some tough geographic areas. In Sichuan Power, we proposed an new data networks for EMS/SCADA data transmission based on VSAT systems. The structure of our system is a star-like topology: we place the VSAT communication terminals to some substations and power plants in areas which cannot afford fiber infrastructures economically or geographically. A central VSAT station is set on Power Dispatching Center. All data in VSAT system are based on TCP/IP protocol. The first problem for such a system is to select suitable VSAT communication modalities. We chose SCPC (Single Carrier per Channel) over TDMA (Time-Division Multiplex Access) as our favorable modality because SCPC could provide reliable and persistent data link and easy to-
-
 manage. A detailed analysis will be included in full text. For IEC 101 protocol, the traditional 2M channel is transferred to IP packets to access the VSAT system. For IEC 104 protocol, data is directly accessed to VAST system through Ethernet connections. Since the satellite link is not stable due to a variety of environmental reasons, traditional TCP may have large transmission delay or even cannot be used in such environments. To meet the requirements of IEC protocols in transmission delay, we developed a TCP/IP accelerator dedicated for satellite communication based on SCPS-TP (Space Communication Protocol Standards - Transport Protocol). The SCPS-TP is modified version of traditional TCP/IP protocol adapted to space communications and it considers the effects of packet loss due to satellite link outage. A SCPS-TP based TCP/IP accelerator is added to each VSAT terminal in order to minimize the transmission delay. Our experiences showed that such VSAT system a very useful and robust in power systems against disasters.

AB  - More and more network applications have appeared in recent years. Government, university, industry and individual Internet users and network services need more bandwidth and various network applications. Many new network protocols are proposed so that it is now becoming harder to manage the network. In the conditional network, every network protocol uses the fixed port, the so-called well-known port number. In the past, it was easy to classify and manage the network traffic because we could identify the network service by the port number. However, new types of network applications do not use fixed port number. The method of traffic classification with fixed port number is inadequate. In recent years, the DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) is used to classify the traffic. This study deploys a NMS (network management system) based on DPI and SNMP. The NMS controls the network devices and services according to the traffic classification of DPIS (DPI server). The platform of DPIS is implemented on the Netfilter framework in Linux kernel.

Then, the high order nonlinear differential equations are linearized by using the perturbation method. Here, the machine speed equations of the system are derived and the eigenvalues are obtained from the state matrix. In addition, the contributions of machines to a particular eigenvalue are computed.

AB  - WAPS (Wide-Area Protection System) utilizes global information to realize system protection instead of local information to achieve better protection performance. Its advantages and research achievements are introduced and its architecture and communication network investigated. Referring to the three generations of SCADA system, the features of three architectures (centralized, distributed and networked) for WAPS are discussed in detail. The networked architecture is considered to be more flexible, reliable and suitable for wide-area protection than the others. The networked WAPS is modeled and simulated based on OPNET simulator. The communication delays of different communication networks are compared and it is suggested to use 100 M Ethernet to deal with burst data transmission.

AB  - In a deregulated electrical power system network, every
transaction of electricity between a generator and a customer involves
some loss. In some cases, a generator while supplying its load however,
may, actually decrease the transmission loss by opposing an initial
flow. This flow is commonly termed as counter-flow. An algorithm has
been developed to trace counter-flow in a deregulated power system
network and calculate transmission loss share of each generator
considering counter-flow. Two methods, namely the incremental load flow
approach (ILFA) and marginal transmission loss approach (MTLA) are
utilized to determine allocation of transmission losses

AB  - China's urbanization has accelerated during the era of reform. While there has been real progress in urbanization, the process has also been skewed by several administrative measures designed to foster urbanization and economic growth. According to a popular view, as many as 70 per cent of China's administrative jurisdictions now come under the rule of urban governments. This must be an exaggeration given that many parts of China are still essentially rural. This article examines three measures - turning prefectures into cities (di gai shi), turning counties into cities (xian gai shi), and turning cities and counties into urban districts (xian shi gai qu) - that have contributed to "inflated urbanization." Five propositions budgetary, urbanization, regulatory, organizational streamlining and policy incentive - are discussed to see if the three measures have either originated from or have affected them. We find that while the regulatory observation is relevant only for the measure of xian shi gai qu, the other four propositions are useful, though to varying degrees, for understanding the logic of the changing "city system" in the past two decades.

AB  - Frequency is an important parameter in power system monitoring, control and protection. This paper shows how a combination of neural networks and genetic algorithm can be used to estimate power system frequency. Neural networks on the other hand offer great advantages in learning, adaptation, fault tolerance and parallelism. Genetic algorithm is a parallel global search technique that emulates natural genetic operators. In the proposed algorithm learning of weights of neural networks is done using genetic algorithm. The results obtained by simulation show better performance of the proposed control structure when compared with traditional error back propagation and least mean square algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is studied through simulations at different situations of power system.

AB  -  This paper proposes a new methodology of the power system dynamic security assessment. It automatically and successively scans contingencies of a power system; furthermore, based on the concept of stability margin, the severity of the contingencies is ranked. Its complement application is on the base of the combination with a dynamic simulation program. The authors demonstrate how to apply this new method to assess the stability security of the real-world network. In the assessment, two types of contingencies (N-1 and N-2) are applied on transformer, generator, bus or line. Assessment results help researchers and operators to make proper adjustment of system operation to ensure system security. It is shown that the new methodology is a comprehensive and practical approach to assess the power system security.

AB  - More than 60 percent of adults in the United States are overweight or obese, and obese persons are more likely to be ill than those who are not. Obesity presents challenges to physicians and patients and also has a negative impact on health status. Some patients who are obese may delay medical care because of concerns about disparagement by physicians and health care staff, or fear of being weighed. Simple accommodations, such as providing large-sized examination gowns and armless chairs, as well as weighing patients in a private area, may make the medical setting more accessible and more comfortable for obese patients. Extremely obese patients often have special health needs, such as lower extremity edema or respiratory insufficiency that require targeted evaluation and treatment. Although physical examination may be more difficult in obese patients, their disproportionate risk for some illnesses that are amenable to early detection increases the priority for preventive evaluations. Physicians can encourage improvements in healthy behaviors, regardless of the patient's desire for, or success with, weight loss treatment.

AB  - Static security assessment of power systems is a time-intensive task involving repetitive solutions of power flow equations. The issue addressed in this paper is how to substantially reduce the amount of offline security assessment simulations used for neural net training. A Kohonen-based classifier is developed for this purpose. With the proposed scheme, the status of the system security is not needed for all training patterns. Only a selected sample of the training patterns needs to be assessed through simulations. Once the network is adequately trained, neurons that respond to secure or insecure states are self organized in clusters. In the testing stage, the pattern security states is determined by correlating the test pattern with a cluster of a known security status. The proposed scheme also provides information on the degree of system insecurity, and the range of the operation violation.

AB  - Breast calcification diagnosis was studied by using clinical findings and computerized image processing of a mammogram in a network of trained expert learning systems (Outcome Advisor [OA]). The system was tested with records not used for training and performance was compared with radiologist. The network was 72% accurate in classifying clusters of calcifications as malignant or benign over a set of test cases radiologists had considered "hard-to-diagnose calcifications," and referred for biopsy. The radiologists had decided to conduct biopsy by selecting an equal number of positive and negative cases for the test group; thus the radiologists' performance with respect to categories of benign versus malignant was constrained to be 50/50. Statistical analysis shows only a 2% probability that the observed accuracy of 72% was a chance performance in recognizing whether a cluster is benign or malignant. The feasibility of developing a network of OAs for diagnosing breast cancer integrating digital image processing of mammograms is promising.

AB  - Harmonic and interharmonic distortion has become a main concern in electric distribution systems. Different types of harmonic and interharmonic sources exist in power system e.g. thyristor bridges, arc furnaces, cycloconverters and saturable magnetic devices. High harmonic voltages can be problematic to various sensitive equipments. Various harmonic surveys are conducted by various utilities and R&amp;amp;D organizations across the world to identify the level of harmonic distortion. National and international standards are implemented in various countries to limit the harmonic distortion. Interharmonics can be found in networks of all voltage classes and can cause temperature rise and torques in induction motors and flicker in lighting equipment. The problem with various available standards is that they are not treating the problem of interharmonics. No significant work on survey of interharmonics present in power system network has been reported. In this paper a summary of results of survey of interharmonics conducted in Indian power system network is presented. Interharmonic survey is conducted at 0.415 KV, 11 KV, 33KV, 132 KV and 220 KV networks feeding power to various categories of customers. The aim of the work is to identify the level of inter-harmonics in the various supply system feeding power to various categories of customers. The measurement and analysis is performed by using advanced power quality analyzer. According to the voltage and current inter-harmonic levels present in various supply systems , the effects of inter-harmonics on the system and solutions are discussed. Result of this survey will help to understand the existing level of interharmonic in voltage and current and need to address interharmonic issue in harmonic standards.

Focusing on rootkits that use inline function hooking techniques, we showed that our system could successfully categorize a sample of rootkits using unsupervised EM clustering. In this paper, we extend our previous work by outlining a new procedure to help system/network administrators identify the rootkits that have infected their machines. Using a logistic regression model for profiling families of rootkits, we were able to identify at least one of the rootkits that had infected each of the systems that we tested.

AB  - Oregon's Legislature in 2011 affirmed a clear and ambitious goal for the State, known as the "40-40-20" goal, which states that by 2025 all adult Oregonians will hold a high school diploma or equivalent, 40% of them will have an associate's degree or a meaningful postsecondary certificate, and 40% will hold a bachelor's degree or advanced degree. Leaders across the state have been working to advance Oregon's educational attainment rates, but the passage of the goal into law through Oregon Senate Bill 253 has prompted a new drive for action and change. On November 1, 2011, approximately 300 education leaders from across the state and the nation convened in Corvallis, Oregon for a day-long symposium, "From Goal to Reality: Achieving 40-40-20 in Oregon," hosted by the Oregon University System (OUS) Chancellor and the Oregon State Board of Higher Education. The symposium brought together Oregon and national policy experts, Governor John Kitzhaber, legislators and policymakers, college and university presidents, K-12 superintendents and practitioners, business and community leaders, and students to look at ways to achieve the 40-40-20 goals. This report highlights just some of the innovative thinking, initiatives, and challenges which were articulated at this event, and which can help guide Oregon's next decisions and conversations about improving educational attainment levels in the state.

AB  - If a large scale of disaster occurs such as the East Japan Great Earthquake, there would be some possibility of the informational isolation from others because of the disconnection of communication network or high congestion. In facts, the East Japan Great Earthquake isolated many Japanese coastal resident areas, and the lack of disaster information is considered to affect the speed of rescue, evacuation, and sending life materials. DTN (Delay Tolerant Network) is supposed to be one of the effective methods to transmit significant data even under poor network conditions. However, when DTN is applied to local areas such as the Japanese Northern East coastal cities which were severely damaged by the earthquake, DTN might not work effectively. That is because there are some considerable problems such as fewer roads, cars, and pedestrians than in urban areas. Moreover, the scale of area is likely wider than that of urban areas because it includes many non-residential areas such as rice fields, gardens, and woods. Therefore, it is necessary to consider additional effective functions when DTN is applied for a Disaster Information Network System in local areas. In this paper, DTN with CWN (Cognitive Wireless Network) is proposed for a Disaster Information Network System for the usage of local areas. Then, we consider the actual usage of DTN in local areas, and the simulation of DTN with different wireless network interfaces as held by the GIS data of Taro, Miyako City, Iwate in Japan, a town severely damaged by the East Japan Great Earthquake. The results and future studies are discussed for the DTN usage of Disaster Information Network System in local areas.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in working with local communities to establish marine protected areas to help conserve dwindling marine resources. Given the urgent nature of this problem, it is essential that project managers and communities learn how to best apply this approach and understand the conditions1 under which this strategy will most likely achieve success. In August 2000, and again in 2003, representatives of a number projects from across the Pacific and Southeast Asia came together in Fiji and the Philippines. Each of the projects is currently using some form of a locally-managed marine area (LMMA) strategy. The meetings were designed to allow these different projects to share and discuss their experiences in using locally-managed marine areas. From these initial meetings, representatives of some of these projects have agreed to work together and form a collaborative 'learning network' so that they can systematically share their knowledge and experiences about how to use this strategy more effectively and improve their conservation impact.2 This network is called the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) Network.

AB  -  Power system stabilizers (PSS) are used to generate supplementary control signals for the excitation system in order to damp the low frequency power system oscillations. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional PSS (CPSS), numerous techniques have been proposed in the literature. Based on the analysis of existing techniques, this paper presents an indirect adaptive neural network based power system stabilizer (IDNC) design. The proposed IDNC consists of a neuro-controller, which is used to generate a supplementary control signal to the excitation system, and a neuro-identifier, which is used to model the dynamics of the power system and to adapt the neuro-controller parameters. The proposed method has the features of a simple structure, adaptivity and fast response. The proposed IDNC is evaluated on a single machine infinite bus power system under different operating conditions and disturbances to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

AB  - While there has been progress towards pandemic preparedness in recent years, continued vigilance and investments are critical for global health security, people’s livelihoods and economic development. There have been three major epidemiological events in the first decade of this century: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. They demonstrate that we face continuing threats of pandemic influenza and other infectious diseases. The risk would appear to be increasing. Pandemics of both known and – as yet – unknown infectious diseases threaten people and economies of all countries. Developing countries are likely to be the hardest hit. There have been intense efforts to address H5N1 HPAI since the early outbreaks of disease in poultry in 2003. They have resulted in significant reductions in the number of countries affected since 2006. This trend could easily be reversed if focus is not maintained and resources are not allocated as part of the routine business of ministries of health and agriculture. There are three priorities. First – continued joint working by governments, communities and industry, both for multi-hazard disaster preparedness and for bio-secure animal rearing. Joint efforts are needed to prevent and control H5N1 HPAI, to ensure that control and response systems tackle a broad range of emerging and existing disease threats and to improve coordination between animal, human and environmental health disciplines. This One Health approach is necessary to ensure that countries are ready to detect, assess and respond to pandemics. Second – long-term investments in animal and human health. Experience from the global responses to SARS, H5N1 HPAI, and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 provide lessons for the future, moving away from emergency measures to longer term sustained disease prevention, the development of capacities to respond to incursions and, where appropriate, to eradicate disease. There will always be a need for improvement in the forecasting and monitoring of disease emergence, spread and potential impact. This will aid the management of risks and consequences, and lead to better capacity for tackling problems at source before they become regional, continental or global threats. The One Health approach will greatly facilitate development of these capacities. Third – well-functioning animal and human health delivery systems. Effective responses to animal and pandemic influenza are best implemented locally. Therefore, all countries should aim to have strong, practical and predictable delivery systems for animal and human health, including emergency and contingency planning systems that reflect global standards and legal frameworks such as the OIE veterinary standards and the WHO International Health Regulations. World leaders at the International Ministerial Conference on Animal and Pandemic Influenza (IMCAPI) 2010 indicated their political support for these priorities through The ‘Hanoi Declaration’ and backing for the ‘Framework for Sustaining Momentum’ – two documents that feature prominently within this report.
