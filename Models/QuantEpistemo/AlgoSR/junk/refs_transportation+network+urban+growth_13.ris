AB  - The detected traffic data for single point or link cannot satisfy the needs for network-level traffic status information with the rapid development of the traffic control and guidance systems. This paper proposed a modeling and clustering method for network-level urban traffic status based on the dynamic traffic flow assignment ratios. The traffic assignment ratio matrix model integrates traffic status, topology and relation between links, with the dynamic traffic assignment ratios estimated by Linear Programming. The network-level traffic status is clustered by Self-Organizing Map and the typical patterns are discovered. The experiment proves the efficiency and applicability of this method for network-level traffic status modeling and analyzing.

AB  - AbstractThe design of urban bus transit systems aims to determine a network configuration with a set of bus lines and associated frequencies that achieve the targeted objective. This paper presents a methodology framework to formulate and solve the bus transit network design problem (TNDP). It first proposes a TNDP taking into account the travel time stochasticity. A robust optimization model is formulated for the proposed problem, which aims to minimize the sum of the expected value of the operator cost and its variability multiplied by a weighting value. A heuristic solution approach, based on k-shortest path algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, Monte Carlo simulation, and probit-type discrete choice model, is subsequently developed to solve the robust optimization model. Finally, the proposed methodology is applied to a numerical example.

AB  - The transportation network design problem (NDP) with multiple objectives and demand uncertainty was originally formulated as a spectrum of stochastic multi-objective programming models in a bi-level programming framework. Solving these stochastic multi-objective NDP (SMONDP) models directly requires generating a family of optimal solutions known as the Pareto-optimal set. For practical implementation, only a good solution that meets the goals of different stakeholders is required. In view of this, we adopt a goal programming (GP) approach to solve the SMONDP models. The GP approach explicitly considers the user-defined goals and priority structure among the multiple objectives in the NDP decision process. Considering different modeling purposes, we provide three stochastic GP models with different philosophies to model planners' NDP decision under demand uncertainty, i.e.; the expected value GP model, chance-constrained GP model, and dependent-chance GP model. Meanwhile, a unified simulation-based genetic algorithm (SGA) solution procedure is developed to solve all three stochastic GP models. Numerical examples are also presented to illustrate the practicability of the GP approach in solving the SMONDP models as well as the robustness of the SGA solution procedure. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  -  The evaluation of on-line intelligent transportation system (ITS) measures, such as adaptive route-guidance and traffic management systems, depend heavily on the use of faster than real time traffic simulation models. Fast-running traffic models are needed off-line for use in iterative approaches that imitate drivers' adaptation to changes to the network topology. The paper describes a simulation-based dynamic-equilibrium traffic assignment model. The determination of time-dependent path flows is modeled as a master problem that is solved using the method of successive averages (MSA). The determination of path travel times for a given set of path flows is the network-loading sub-problem, which is solved using the space-time queueing approach of Mahut (2000). This loading method has been shown to provide reasonably accurate results with very little computational effort. The model was applied to the Stockholm road network, which consists of 4342 links, 1980 nodes and 250 zones, representing over 11,000 turns. The results show that this model is applicable to medium-size networks with a very reasonable computation time.

AB  - This paper puts forward an alternative method which deals with the simulation and estimation of urban traffic network. The method is based on Cell Transmission Model (CTM), a macroscopic model for freeway traffic modeling. Some modifications on basic CTM are made to meet the requirement of urban traffic modeling. In order to test the performance of this model, a small virtual traffic network is set up and its simulation results are compared with those of Paramics', a microscopic simulator implemented under similar conditions. Furthermore, a much larger virtual network based on real metropolitan traffic system is constructed and investigated, using which we test the propagation of congestion. We reach the conclusion that our macroscopic model has the potential to depict the general evolution of urban traffic system, and simulate the propagation of congestion within complicated traffic network.

AB  - Control in urban traffic networks constitutes an important and challenging research topic nowadays. In the literature, a lot of work can be found devoted to improving the performance of the traffic flow in such systems, by means of controlling the red-to-green switching times of traffic signals. Different techniques have been proposed and commercially implemented, ranging from heuristic methods to model-based optimization. However, given the complexity of the dynamics and the scale of urban traffic networks, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. In this work, a new hybrid model for the traffic behavior at an intersection is introduced. It captures important aspects of the flow dynamics in urban networks. It is shown how this model can be used in order to obtain control strategies that improve the flow of traffic at intersections, leading to the future possibility of controlling several connected intersections in a distributed way.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

AB  - This paper presents a novel user equilibrium traffic assignment model in view of the fuzzy path costs for multiclass transportation network. In the model, drivers are divided into several classes according as their knowledge about the network traffic condition and travel-decision characteristics are the same within each class, but differ among classes. Some new concepts, such as OD perceived cost and familiar level with the traffic condition, are introduced based on a-cut of fuzzy set. The equilibrium principle is defined based on the similarity measure and equilibrium condition is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. A numerical example shows that the proposed model obtains more realistic results than the other two models, UE and SUE.

AB  - Network traffic policy verification is the analysis of network traffic to determine if the observed traffic is in compliance or violation of the applied policy. An intuitive approach is the use of machine learning techniques based on specific network traffic characteristics. These traffic characteristics are also known as features, which have to be extracted and selected carefully to build robust and accurate learning models. Thus, finding the best possible learning model in combination with extracting the best possible feature-set is a necessary requirement to design accurate traffic classification models. While feature selection can be automated to find the best subset of a given set of features, there are no known mechanisms to solve the problem of feature extraction. Thus, extracting the best possible features has to be done empirically. In this work we present a framework to simplify the empirical model selection and feature extraction process.

AB  - Based on long-term transportation network design decisions and potential parameter variations, it is important that demand uncertainty is considered in transportation modeling. In this paper, we present a novel robustness measure that combines the two objectives by minimizing the expected travel time while bounding the relative regret in each scenario facing uncertain origin-destination demand (OD demand). The concept of ??-robust solution is introduced into the transportation network design problem. We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

Experiments show that these techniques can significantly improve the performance of the fluid-based network simulation.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

In this talk, we analyze traffic data collected from three deployed networks: a cellular wireless network used by public safety agancies, a satellite network used by Internet service providers, and the Internet. We describe analysis of network log data collected from E-Comm, a public safety trunked radio network that utilizes circuit-switched cellular wireless technology. We examine statistical distributions and autocorrelation functions of call inter-arrival and call holding times during busy hours. Our findings indicate that traditional Er land models used for voice traffic may not be suitable for evaluating the performance of trunked radio networks.

We investigate long-range dependence as the traffic patterns very, propose a traffic model for the transmission control protocol (TCP) connections, and use data from billing records to predict future traffic loads. Since discovering network topology is important for analyzing routing protocols and network robustness and resilience, we also examine datasets from the route views and RIPE projects and identify important properties of Internet graphs.

AB  - This paper uses a genetic algorithm to systematically examine the underlying characteristics of the optimal bus transit route network design problem (BTRNDP) with variable transit demand. A multiobjective nonlinear mixed integer model is formulated for the BTRNDP. The proposed solution framework consists of three main components: an initial candidate route set generation procedure (ICRSGP) that generates all feasible routes incorporating practical bus transit industry guidelines; and a network analysis procedure (NAP) that decides transit demand matrix, assigns transit trips, determines service frequencies, and computes performance measures; and a genetic algorithm procedure (GAP) that combines these two parts, guides the candidate solution generation process, and selects an optimal set of routes from the huge solution space. A C++ program code is developed to implement the proposed solution methodology for the BTRNDP with variable transit demand. An example network is successfully tested as a pilot study. Sensitivity analyses are performed. Comprehensive characteristics underlying the BTRNDP, including the effect of route set size, the effect of demand aggregation, and the redesign of the existing transit network issue, are also presented.

AB  - Our research work concerns the development of a multimodal urban traffic simulator designed to be a tool of decision-making aid similar to a game wherein the user-player can test different scenarios by immersion in a 3D virtual city. Our approach is based on the activity-based model and the multi-agent technology. The implemented result is a hybrid simulator connecting numerical simulation and behavioural aspects coming from real data. This paper is focused on two points: firstly, we introduce how a final user (the traffic regulator) instantiates and assembles components so as to model a city and its urban traffic network; secondly, we present the use of Dempster-Shafer theory in the context of discrete choice modelling. Our approach manipulates input variables in order to test realistic representations of behaviours of agent categories in a decision-making process. The traffic modelling is based on a questionnaire elaborated from standard arrays of Taguchi. The significant variables and interactions are determined with the analysis of variance which suggests a reduced model describing the behaviour of a particular social category. The belief theory is used to take into account the doubt of some respondents as well as for the preferences redistribution if the number of alternatives changes. The effects of external traffic conditions are also quantified to choose a 'robust' alternative and to use the agents' memory.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The traffic assignment problem associated with a given transportation network is the process of distributing zone-to-zone trips on links of the network. A number of methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but none have been found to be entirely satisfactory. This paper is concerned with the nonlinear mathematical model of the problem, where the link-traveling costs are increasing functions of the link flows and no explicit capacity constraint is imposed on individual links. An efficient algorithm is developed, using a node-arc formulation of the problem. It is an adaptation of the convex-simplex method that takes advantage of the very special network structure of the traffic assignment problem formulated in this way. Numerical results obtained with a moderate size street network are presented.

AB  - Numerous transportation applications as diverse as capital investment decision-making, vehicle fleet planning, and traffic light signal setting all involve some form of (discrete choice) network design. In this paper, we review some of the uses and limitations of integer programming-based approaches to network design, and describe several discrete and continuous choice models and algorithms. Our objectives are threefold—to provide a unifying view for synthesizing many network design models, to propose a unifying framework for deriving many network design algorithms, and to summarize computational experience in solving design problems. We also show that many of the most celebrated combinatorial problems that arise in transportation planning are specializations and variations of a generic design model. Consequently, the network design concepts described in this paper have great potential application in a wide range of problem settings.

AB  - The vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) consists in assigning a set of scheduled trips to a set of vehicles in the public transportation, where the relation of every trip is not only cooperation but also competition. This paper analyzes two sorts of optimization models for vehicle scheduling problem in public transportation. The problems of minimizing vehicles’ time headway for cooperation network and maximizing the value for competition network are formulated in this presented paper. Also, the departure interval model is presented. The above models are solved by the heuristic algorithms in the presented paper respectively, and the numerical results show that the solutions are more efficient

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization\nproblems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which\ncan characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to\nstochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization\nproblem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - If we are to accommodate the rate of urban growth which North America will face in the first half of the twenty-first century, it is the contention of this paper that we must build new cities, not new towns, beyond commuting distance of existing cities. These can be located in open countryside on virgin land, or they can grow around existing small towns, all in conjunction with the construction of an innovative personal transportation system. In this paper a hexagonal modular structure, in which self-contained urban units can be combined and added to over time, is proposed as a new urban form and AVCS maglev - which will serve the new cities efficiently - is proposed as a key transportation strategy.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - We consider a transportation network with a set of origins and a set of destinations. Given a set of budgets for the residential and employment developments, and network enhancement, the problem is one of allocating the resources within the system, so that the probability of overloading the links in the network is minimized. For the improved transportation system with new household and employment distribution patterns, a combined distribution and assignment model is used to map the land-use pattern to the link-loading pattern in the network. Assuming that the actual demand of each origin-destination (O-D) pair follows a certain distribution, the road users choose their destination and route in accordance with the user equilibrium principle that is based on the long-run perceived travel cost. Moreover, it is assumed that despite the short-term demand fluctuation, the O-D-link choice proportion remains unchanged for the choices of destination and route, and the stochastic demand of all O-D pairs are independent. Explicit formulae for the mean and variance of the traffic volume on each link are derived. Using the central limit theorem, the probability that the traffic volume does not exceed the link capacity can be estimated, from which we can calculate a network reliability index. This index represents the probability that all links in the network are within the respective capacities. The problem can be formulated as a bi-level program, in which the upper-level sub-program maximizes the network reliability index with respect to the residential and employment allocations and network enhancements, whereas the lower-level sub-program is the combined distribution and assignment model with long-run travel cost functions. The problem is solved by a genetic algorithm. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology.

AB  - A structural model is provided for traffic assignment to a transit model. It deals with a hierarchy of layers from passenger to network passing by vehicle, service route and line, while taking advantage of the spatial structure of service routes and lines. A range of capacity effects are addressed: in-vehicle passenger capacity, access-egress capacity in relation to dwelling time, platform occupancy by vehicles which may reduce service frequency. The model treatment involves a line sub-model, which amounts to a sophisticated cost-flow relationship, and platform sub-models first for passenger storage and flowing, second for vehicle operations. Traffic equilibrium is addressed in a hyper path framework on the basis of leg links. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examine the impact of network traffic dependencies on queueing performance in the context of a popular stochastic model, namely the infinite capacity discrete-time queue with deterministic service rate and M | G | ??? arrival process. We propose approximations to the stationary queue size distribution which are generated by interpolating between heavy and light traffic extremes. This is done under both long- and short-range dependent network traffic. Under long-range dependence, the heavy traffic results can be expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler special functions which generalize the exponential distribution and yet display power-law decay. Numerical results from exact expressions (when available), approximations and simulations support the following conclusions: Network traffic dependencies need to be carefully accounted for, but whether this is accomplished through a short- or long-range dependent stochastic model bears little impact on queueing performance. The differences between exponential and power-law queueing are negligible at the "head" of the distribution, and manifest themselves only for large buffers. ?? 2007.

AB  - We provide a sensitivity analysis of separable traffic equilibrium models with travel cost and demand parameters. We establish that while equilibrium link flows may not always be directionally differentiable (even when the link travel costs are strictly increasing), travel demands and link costs are; this improves the general results of Patriksson [Patriksson, M., 2004. Sensitivity analysis of traffic equilibria. Transportation Science 37, 258-281]. The new results contradict common belief that equilibrium cost and demand sensitivities hinge on that of equilibrium flows. The paper by Tobin and Friesz [Tobin, R.L., Friesz, T.L., 1988. Sensitivity analysis for equilibrium network flow. Transportation Science 22, 242-250] brought the classic non-linear programming subject of sensitivity analysis to transportation science. Theirs is still the most widely used device by which "gradients" of traffic equilibrium solutions are calculated, for use in bilevel transportation planning applications such as network design, origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation and problems where link tolls are imposed on the users in order to reach a traffic management objective. However, it is not widely understood that the regularity conditions proposed by them are stronger than necessary. Also, users of their method sometimes misunderstand its limitations and are not aware of the computational advantages offered by more recent methods. In fact, a more often applicable formula was proposed already by Qiu and Magnanti [Qiu, Y., Magnanti, T.L., 1989. Sensitivity analysis for variational inequalities defined on polyhedral sets. Mathematics of Operations Research 14, 410-432], and Bell and Iida [Bell, M.G.H., Iida, Y., 1997. Transportation Network Analysis. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK] describe one of the cases in practice in which the formula by Tobin and Friesz would not be able to generate sensitivity information, because one of their regularity conditions fails to hold. This paper provides an overview of this formula, and illustrates by means of examples that there are several cases where it is not applicable. Our findings are illustrated with small numerical examples, as are our own analysis. The findings of this paper are hoped to motivate replacing the previous approach with the more often applicable one, not only because of this fact but equally importantly because it is intuitive and also can be much more efficiently utilized: the sensitivity problem that provides the directional derivative is a linearized traffic equilibrium problem, and the sensitivity information can be generated efficiently by only slightly modifying a state-of-the-art traffic equilibrium solver. This is essential for bringing the use of sensitivity analysis in transportation planning beyond the solution of only toy problems. We finally utilize a new sensitivity solver in the preliminary testing of a simple heuristic for bilevel optimization in continuous traffic network design, and compare it favourably to previous heuristics on known small-scale problems. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work proposes a hybrid traffic model for multimedia networks as a fundamental element in a network planning optimization procedure. The proposed model uses a combination of the fBm (fractional Brownian motion) and Markovian traffic characterization procedures combined with link parameters in order to produce more accurate values of QoS metrics. The hybrid traffic model was evaluated in a network scenario that aggregates different traffic types with different combinations of Hurst parameters and variance coefficients. The results show that the QoS metrics calculated with the hybrid traffic model appear to be more accurate than the ones obtained exclusively with the fBm or the Markovian models. With these results, the proposed model appears to be useful in network planning optimization methods. .

AB  - In order to represent traffic assignment on a road network, we propose a new route choice model taking account of the imprecisions and the uncertainties lying in the dynamic choice process. This model makes possible a more accurate description of the process than those (deterministic or stochastic) used in the literature. We assume that drivers choose a path all the more than it is foreseen to have a lesser cost. The predicted cost for each path is modelled by a fuzzy subset which can represent imprecision on network knowledge (e.g. length of links) as well as uncertainty on traffic conditions (e.g. congested or uncongested network, incident … ). The costs of all possible paths are compared and result in an attractiveness degree for each path. Various comparison indices can be used to represent the different possible natures of drivers when making their decisions (pessimistic/optimistic, risk-taking/risk-averting). The fuzzy choice model was compared with the LOGIT model (a widely used stochastic discrete choice model) and has been proved to be able to find the same results. The effect of Advanced Travellers Information Systems (ATIS) on drivers is modeled as a modification of the imprecision or the uncertainty of the predicted cost of a route.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Foreword : Railway stations are at the heart of the nation’s psyche. They feature in blockbuster films, romantic novels and the skylines of many towns and cities. However, they are far more important to the nation than as mere artistic reference points. Millions of people use the nation’s railway stations every day. Towns and cities have often developed around them, placing railway stations in the heart of many communities. The station can often help to provide an identity or symbol for the town or city; it can act as a point of reference as well as a civic amenity for people who want to use the station’s facilities, whether they are travelling or not. Done well, their design and operation helps to facilitate the success of the national rail network. A successful railway station will add to the passenger experience as well as support the economic, social and environmental benefits of rail. Their effective integration with other modes of transport and the surrounding area can provide for an end-to-end journey experience that makes sustainable public transport a real alternative to private vehicle usage. Given these varying demands on stations it is vitally important that they are planned, designed and improved in a manner that recognises all that they have to offer. I hope that this Guide will aid promoters, planners, architects and sponsors of station schemes to develop railway stations that maintain and enhance the legacy and contribution of stations going forward.

AB  - Previous approaches used to solve the transit route network design problem (TRNDP) can be classified into three categories: 1) Practical guidelines and ad hoc procedures; 2) Analytical optimization models for idealized situations; and 3) Meta-heuristic approaches for more practical problems. When the TRNDP is solved for a network of realistic size in which many parameters need to be determined, it is a combinatorial and NP-hard problem in nature and several sources of non-linearities and non- convexities involved preclude guaranteed globally optimal solution algorithms. As a result, the meta-heuristic approaches, which are able to pursue reasonably good local (possibly global) optimal solutions and deal with simultaneous design of the transit route network and determination of its associated service frequencies, become necessary. The objective of this research is to systematically study the optimal TRNDP using hybrid heuristic algorithms at the distribution node level without aggregating the travel demand zones into a single node. A multi-objective nonlinear mixed integer model is formulated for the TRNDP. The proposed solution framework consists of three main components: an Initial Candidate Route Set Generation Procedure (ICRSGP) that generates all feasible routes incorporating practical bus transit industry guidelines; a Network Analysis Procedure (NAP) that determines transit trips for the TRNDP with variable demand, assigns these transit trips, determines service frequencies and computes performance measures; and a Heuristic Search Procedure (HSP) that guides the search techniques. Five heuristic algorithms, including the genetic algorithm, local search, simulated annealing, random search and tabu search, are employed as the solution methods for finding an optimal set of routes from the huge solution space. For the TRNDP with small network, the exhaustive search method is also used as a benchmark to examine the efficiency and measure the quality of the solutions obtained by using these heuristic algorithms. Several C++ program codes are developed to implement these algorithms for the TRNDP both with fixed and variable transit demand. Comprehensive experimental networks are used and successfully tested. Sensitivity analyses for each algorithm are conducted and model comparisons are performed. Numerical results are presented and the multi-objective decision making nature of the TRNDP is explored. Related characteristics underlying the TRNDP are identified, inherent tradeoffs are described and the redesign of the existing transit network is also discussed.

AB  - This book is the result of several years of research into the modelling and efficient solution of problems in transportation planning and related areas. The aim of this book is to provide a unified account of the development of models and methods for the problem of estimating equilibrium traffic flows in urban areas, from the early days of transportation planning heuristics to today's advanced equilibrium models and methods. Also, the aim is to show the scope and---just as important---the limitations of present traffic models. The development is described and analyzed using the powerful instruments of nonlinear optimization and mathematical programming within the field of operations research. The book includes historical references as well as many recent developments, and aims to clarify the close relationships between several lines of development by placing them in a new, unifying framework. The first part of the book is devoted to mathematical models for the analysis of transportation network equilibria. Chapter 1 describes the traditional transportation planning process of which traffic assignment is a central part. The development of traffic assignment heuristics is described. Chapter 2 analyzes the basic models of traffic assignment, based on the principles of Wardrop. Existence, uniqueness and stability results are given. Extensions of the basic models, including non-deterministic travel cost perceptions and additional flow relationships modelled through the introduction of side constraints, are discussed. Chapter 3 analyzes traffic equilibrium models for general travel cost functions such as variational inequality, nonlinear complementarity, and fixed point problems. The recent development of optimization reformulations of asymmetric variational inequalities is accounted for in detail. The second part of the book is devoted to methods for traffic equilibrium problems. Chapter 4 gives a uniform description of methods for the basic traffic assignment models and their extensions discussed in Chapter 2. Important concepts, such as partial linearization, decomposition, and column generation, are described in detail for general convex programs, and are subsequently used to describe and interrelate traffic assignment methods. Chapter 5 gives the corresponding treatment of the general traffic equilibrium models described in Chapter 3, based on the concepts of cost approximation, decomposition, and column generation. Optimization reformulations of general traffic equilibrium problems are utilized to derive a new class of traffic equilibrium methods which requires mild assumptions on the models. An appendix summarizes the definitions of the concepts most frequently used. The scope of the material is limited to static models of traffic equilibrium; neither dynamic nor combined traffic models are dealt with in detail. The results obtained in this book can, however, be applied to the analysis and solution of such models also. In order to economize with the space available, the reader is often directed to other works for more details. The resulting reference list is extensive---it contains more than 1,000 entries---and serves the additional purpose of being a source for anyone interested in acquiring deeper knowledge in the field. The book will be of interest to researchers in transportation, operations research, and quantitative economics---and those entering these areas of research---who wish to extend their knowledge of equilibrium modelling and analysis, and of the foundations of efficient optimization methods adapted for the solution of large-scale models. The book can also be used in advanced graduate courses in the areas just mentioned. This book could provide the basic material for a course in transportation research. A course in structured mathematical programming, with application to traffic equilibrium problems, is defined by Chapters 2 and 4, or by Chapters 2-5, the latter including the foundations of variational inequality models and methods. A course in equilibrium modelling is defined by Chapters 2 and 3. The text assumes some familiarity with nonlinear programming theory and techniques: it would therefore be preferable to combine material from this book with that of a modern textbook in nonlinear programming.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - A coordination of vehicle flows is usually reached by a cyclical operation of traffic lights, and by synchronizing these cycles. The typical conditions, however, for which traffic lights are normally optimized for, never occur exactly. Large fluctuations in the number of vehicles arriving during one cycle time may lead to an inefficient usage of green times, which are often either too short or too long. The method we propose here allows for variable adjustments not only of the duration, but also of the order of green phases, while it reaches at least the same intersection throughput capacity as an optimized fixed-time controller. This is particularly important, when intersections are highly saturated, road networks are heterogeneous, or if public transport is to be prioritized. We reach the stabilization of queues and red-time durations by a decentralized supervision of (potentially unstable) locally optimizing traffic light controllers. The proposed supervisory concept makes sure that all network flows get a green light regularly and long enough. In addition, it enables flexible responses to local fluctuations in the demand, and it favors a self-organized coordination of traffic flows. In a simulation of the city center of Dresden, Germany, we could compare the proposed concept with an adaptive state-of-the-art controller (which has been optimized within the same simulation suite and includes green waves). Results indicate that not only the mean value of travel times is reduced, but also in their variance, which is positive for the reliability of public transport and individual trip scheduling.

AB  - This paper presents a novel fuzzy model and a fuzzy logic controller for an isolated signalized intersection. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal waiting time and length of queue. Usually fuzzy traffic controllers are optimized to maximize traffic flows/minimize traffic waiting time under typical traffic conditions. Consequentially, these are not the optimal traffic controllers under exceptional traffic cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We apply state-space equations to formulate the average waiting time vehicles in traffic network at fixed time control. also, We propose a novel fuzzy model and new fuzzy traffic controller that can optimally control traffic flows under both normal and exceptional traffic conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller at novel fuzzy model is better that of conventional fuzzy traffic controllers under normal and abnormal traffic conditions.

AB  - The traditional method of road traffic design normally only considers how to meet the traffic demand in a single node, due to a lack of network analysis, resulting in an unreasonable distribution of road network resources. Based on this condition, the characters and nodes correlation in the signal control traffic network were analyzed from the perspective of matching the road facility network and the traffic flow network. Then a computing model of nodes correlation was proposed and empirical analysis was carried out using field data. The results show that this model can give a good description of nodes correlation and can be used as the basis of traffic network analysis and design. © ASCE.

AB  - Thousands of diverse applications and services flow daily over networks used by governments, industry, and private users. Attacks can be hidden within these information flows by disguising malicious network traffic to appear to be legitimate. Generally, TCP or UDP based protocols can be mapped to specific network services. However, intruders do hide unauthorized activity by using non-standard protocols or standard protocols in non-standard ways to avoid detection. This paper describes current work and future directions that the Network Security Research Group at the Communication Research Centre (CRC) would take to identify flows of information that disguise attacks. Research challenges include uncovering unauthorized activities in high-speed, high-volume network links and within protocols that are intended to obscure the details of the information carried

AB  - It has been approved that the scale-free feature exists in various complex networks, such as the internet, the cell or the biological networks. In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - This paper presents a vehicle routing problem in dynamic urban traffic network with real-time traffic information. Both re-current and non-recurrent congestion are considered in the problem. We develop a method to solve the problem by combining the initial routes arrangement with the real-time route adjustment. The initial route planning is made by solving a time-dependent vehicle routing problem under recurrent congestion conditions. The genetic algorithm is applied. During the plan implementation, a new mechanism updating at the critical node is proposed to adjust the routes with real-time traffic information subject to the unexpected traffic accidents in non-recurrent congestion environment. Through the numerical simulation, the results show that the new route updating mechanism is more effective than others in the literatures, and the advantage by adopting the new mechanism becomes more prominent when the network becomes more dynamic.

AB  - A predictive continuum dynamic user-optimal (PDUO-C) model is formulated in this study to investigate the dynamic characteristics of traffic flow and the corresponding route-choice behavior of travelers within a region with a dense urban road network. The modeled region is arbitrary in shape with a single central business district (CBD) and travelers continuously distributed over the region. Within this region, the road network is represented as a continuum and travelers patronize a two-dimensional continuum transportation system to travel to the CBD. The PDUO-C model is solved by a promising solution algorithm that includes elements of the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method (FEM), and the explicit total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta (TVD-RK) time-stepping method. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the utility of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm in solving this PDUO-C problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Crossroads are important part of urban traffic system, whose flow prediction on each direction is one of the most extraordinary key functions in the urban ITS. Some forecasting models have been developed, but these methods' precision usually can't meet with practical requirement. In this article, a neural network model is presented for forecasting crossroads traffic flow using backpropagation (BP) neural network. Through forecasting traffic flow at Hongqi crossroad in Ganzhou City, the result shows that this model has a considerable accuracy, which provides a new reliable and effective way of forecasting short term traffic flow of crossroads in urban road network.

Accurate network traffic modeling and prediction are important for network provisioning and problem diagnosis, but network traffic is highly dynamic. To achieve better modeling and prediction it is needed to isolate anomalies from normal traffic variation. Thus, we decompose traffic signals into two parts normal variations, that follow certain law and are predictable and, anomalies that consist of sudden changes and are not predictable. ARIMA analysis and modeling for network traffic prediction is able to detect and identify volume anomaly or outliers.

AB  - A quantity of practical importance in the design of an infrastructure network is the amount of traffic along different parts in the network. Traffic patterns primarily depend on the users' preference for short paths through the network and spatial constraints for building the necessary connections. Here we study the traffic distribution in a network model which takes both of these considerations into account. Assuming users always travel along the shortest path available, the appropriate measure for traffic flow along the links is a generalization of the usual concept of "edge betweenness". We find that for networks with a minimal total construction cost, a small number of connections must handle a disproportionate amount of traffic. However, the introduction of even very few additional links greatly reduces the maximal traffic along any of the links in the network.

AB  - This article addresses the problem of a traffic network design problem (NDP) under demand uncer- tainty. The origindestination trip matrices are taken as random variables with known probability distributions. Instead of finding optimal network design solutions for a given future scenario,we are concerned with solutions that are in some sense good for a variety of demand realiza- tions.We introduce a definition of robustness accounting for the planners required degree of robustness. We pro- pose a formulation of the robust network design problem (RNDP) and develop a methodology based on genetic al- gorithm (GA) to solve the RNDP. The proposed model generates globally near-optimal network design solutions, f, based on the planners input for robustness. The study makes two important contributions to the network design literature. First, robust network design solutions are sig- nificantly different from the deterministic NDPs and not accounting for them could potentially underestimate the network-wide impacts. Second, systematic evaluation of the performance of the model and solution algorithm is conducted on different test networks and budget levels to explore the efficacy of this approach. The results high- light the importance of accounting for robustness in trans- portation planning and the proposed approach is capable of producing high-quality solutions.

constructed combining the deterministic traffic signal control system

traffic congestion length are described by a linear time-varying
discrete dynamic system. The three signal control parameters consisting
of the cycle length, green split and offset are aimed to be
systematically and adaptively controlled so as to minimize the sum of
the traffic congestion lengths in a traffic network. We propose such a
route guidance algorithm as evaluates the shortest mean travel time
route from the driver's current position to his destination. From the

AB  - The technologies and applications aiming at the dynamic properties of micro-level road traffic have made plenty of contributions for the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in past decades, which causes a lack of understanding and analysis for the dynamical properties of the whole structure at macro-level. Therefore, in this paper, we construct the Variable-Structure Dynamic Network modle (VSDN) and the Extended Variable-Structure Dynamic Network model (EVSDN) for urban road traffic systems, basing on the Level-Of-Service (LOS) and the traffic reachability. The VSDN model defines the edge set at any time includes only the edges whose LOS lies in un-congestion levels, which causes that the structure of the urban road traffic network varies with time. Furthermore, we extend VSDN to EVSDN that redefines the edge set to combine the micro-level time-varying characteristics into the macro-level topology. The experiments with traffic data and topology data of the Beijing road traffic system show that the EVSDN model is scale-free at some peak-time phases and the appearance of the scale-free property represents the significant change of topological features of urban road traffic networks. During rush hours, the scale-free property can be used to characterize urban road traffic networks.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - Network location models have been used extensively for siting public and private facilities. In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions. We conclude by identifying promising research directions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uncertainties in demand and supply simultaneously cause the travel time variations. Confronted with such travel time variations, drivers with and without ATIS will take different travel time reliability-based path choice behaviors. After the consideration of the co-relationship between the two driver classes, such path choice problem is formulated as a mixed equilibrium traffic assignment model in terms of a variational inequality problem, which can be solved by a heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the new features of the proposed model.

AB  - This paper proposes a global optimization algorithm for solving a mixed (continuous/discrete) transportation network design problem (MNDP), which is generally expressed as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraint (MPEC). The upper level of the MNDP aims to optimize the network performance via both expansion of existing links and addition of new candidate links, whereas the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) problem. In this paper, we first formulate the UE condition as a variational inequality (VI) problem, which is defined from a finite number of extreme points of a link-flow feasible region. The MNDP is approximated as a piecewise-linear programming (P-LP) problem, which is then transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. A global optimization algorithm based on a cutting constraint method is developed for solving the MILP problem. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and to compare the results with alternative algorithms reported in the literature.

AB  - Traffic simulation is an important tool for modelling the operations of dynamic traffic systems and helps analyse the causes and potential solutions of traffic problems such as congestion and traffic safety. Microscopic simulation models provide a detailed representation of the traffic process, which makes them most suitable for evaluation of complicated traffic facilities and Intelligent Transportation Systems that often consist of complex traffic management, safety and information systems. Macroscopic and mesoscopic models on the other hand, capture traffic dynamics in lesser detail, but are faster and easier to apply and calibrate than microscopic models. Therefore they are most suitable for modelling large networks, while microscopic models are usually applied to smaller areas. The objective of this thesis is to combine the strengths of both modelling approaches and diminish their individual weaknesses by constructing a hybrid mesoscopic-microscopic model that applies microscopic simulation to areas of specific interest, while simulating a surrounding network in lesser detail with a mesoscopic model. Earlier attempts at hybrid modelling have concentrated on integrating macroscopic and microscopic models and have proved difficult due to the large difference between the continuous-flow representation of traffic in macroscopic models and the detailed vehicle-and driver-behaviour represented in microscopic models. These problems are solved in this thesis by developing a mesoscopic vehicle-based and event-based model that avoids the (dis)aggregation problems of traffic flows at the inter-model boundaries. In addition, this thesis focuses on the general problems of consistency across the entire hybrid model. The requirements are identified that are important for a hybrid model to be consistent across the models at different levels of detail. These requirements vary from network and route-choice consistency to consistency of traffic dynamics across the boundaries of the micro- and mesoscopic submodels. An integration framework is proposed that satisfies these requirements. This integration

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We study the stochastic transportation-inventory network design problem involving one supplier and multiple retailers. Each retailer faces some uncertain demand, and safety stock must be maintained to achieve suitable service levels. However, risk-pooling benefits may be achieved by allowing some retailers to serve as distribution centers for other retailers. The problem is to determine which retailers should serve as distribution centers and how to allocate the other retailers to the distribution centers. Shen et al. (2003) formulated this problem as a set-covering integer-programming model. The pricing problem that arises from the column generation algorithm gives rise to a new class of the submodular function minimization problem. In this paper, we show that by exploiting certain special structures, we can solve the general pricing problem in Shen et al. efficiently. Our approach utilizes the fact that the set of all lines in a two-dimension plane has low VC-dimension. We present computational results on several instances of sizes ranging from 40 to 500 retailers. Our solution technique can be applied to a wide range of other concave cost-minimization problems.

A new method of non-stationary network traffic based on superstatistics theory is discussed in the paper.

The user equilibrium distribution of flow was found by using the Frank-Wolfe algorithm. The applied algorithm was analyzed in some aspects such as number of iterations, convergence patterns, response time, as well as changes in network demand. The traffic assignment models were analyzed by using the algorithm during the P.M. peak hour (hour of highest traffic congestion). The analysis was compared with the results from the traffic assignment procedure using TransCAD® (well-known and used transportation demand software) for the 2005 database and it was found that the software is somewhat faster than the algorithm, but the latter could be a good tool for practitioners and students for modeling small networks.

AB  - Full article: UK, 18th March 2013 - As part of the response to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) the UK government has announced it will not commit to long-term financial support for the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) beyond 2013-14. This team plays a vital role in preventing wildlife crime here in the UK, and is also a contributor in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.  Commenting, Heather Sohl, species expert for WWF-UK said: "This is highly disappointing news, especially after the UK has fought hard towards an end to international wildlife trafficking at the CITES meeting over the last two weeks.[1] When the world is recognising illegal wildlife trade as a serious crime and looking for government commitments to end the trade, the UK should be stepping up its efforts to address these crimes within our own borders. The recommendations of the Committee are reasonable and would have achieved this, but the government is avoiding a long-term commitment to tackling wildlife crime."  The Government also rejected recommendations to tighten up the recording of wildlife crime data to help keep track and tackle trends in wildlife crime. Stephanie Pendry, Enforcement Programme Leader at TRAFFIC, who has worked as part of the unit, said: "I have witnessed first-hand the vital role that this unit plays. In the case of illegal wildlife trade, culprits are often part of wider criminal networks that operate across borders, and cracking down on such trade takes time and joint effort. It is precisely this time that the Unit have not been afforded by the Government, which is a real shame and will have a knock-on effect on operations to protect wildlife."  WWF and TRAFFIC gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) early last year and this was reflected in the October 2012 report on wildlife crime in the UK. It suggested that enforcement of wildlife crime in the UK is suffering due to the short term availability of funds, a lack of proper training and guidance over prosecutions, and unnecessarily complex legislation.[2]  UK prosecutors and judiciary must be aware of the serious nature of these crimes and how to handle them appropriately. Available penalties are not applied rigorously enough to reflect the nature of illegal wildlife trade crimes, so fail to act as a strong deterrent for future offences. Specialist wildlife crime training for generalist prosecutors and sentencing guidelines for the judiciary are needed.  The creation of specific wildlife crime codes have been rejected by the Home Office, but without the ability to record wildlife crime levels it is impossible to show the impact of such crime, and what trends are occurring, both over time and regionally. It is hard to justify more resources when it is not possible to demonstrate the true size and trends of the problem. If codes are not the answer, WWF and TRAFFIC urge the government to demonstrate an appropriate, alternative way to capture the information on crimes so desperately needed using existing systems.  Many of the EAC recommendations are also reflected in their inquiry from 2004. WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the Government to reconsider how it can take appropriate actions to address wildlife crime.  Notes to editors: [1] CITES is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The 16th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP) took place in Bangkok, Thailand between 3 and 14 March 2013. www.cites.org  [2] The Environmental Audit Committee conducted an inquiry into Wildlife Crime in the summer of 2012 and published its report in October. http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmenvaud/140/14 002.htm  [3] In February 2-13 the government announced one further year of funding for the unit until April 2014 - at the same level of funding as 2012-13 - but it did not comment on its intentions to make a long-term arrangement for funding the Unit, as recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new\nand redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is\nconcerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway)\nnetwork users. This paper presents a hi-level optimization model-in\nwhich the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first\ntime-for solving the public transportation network redesign problem\n(PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total\ncost, including user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost,\nfor the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource-\nand policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user\nself-routing optimization problem in which all transit users try to find\nthe transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number\nof transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic\nalgorithm-based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP hi-level\noptimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical\nresults are described.

AB  - This study developed a dynamic traffic control formulation designated as dynamic intersection signal control optimization (DISCO). Traffic in DISCO is modeled after the cell-transmission model (CTM), which is a convergent numerical approximation to the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. It considers the entire fundamental diagram and captures traffic phenomena such as shockwaves and queue dynamics. As a dynamic approach, the formulation derives dynamic timing plans for time-variant traffic patterns. We solved DISCO based on a genetic algorithm (GA) approach and applied it to a traffic black spot in Hong Kong that is notorious for severe congestion. For performance comparisons, we also applied TRANSYT to the same scenarios. The Results showed that DISCO outperformed TRANSYT for all the scenarious tested especially in congested traffic. For the congested scenarios, DISCO could reduce delay by as much as 33% when compared with TRANSYT. Even for the uncongested scenarios, DISCO's delays could be smaller by as much as 23%. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper addresses the discrete network design problem (DNDP) with multiple capacity levels, or multi-capacity DNDP for short, which determines the optimal number of lanes to add to each candidate link in a road network. We formulate the problem as a bi-level programming model, where the upper level aims to minimize the total travel time via adding new lanes to candidate links and the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) problem. We propose two global optimization methods by taking advantage of the relationship between UE and system optimal (SO) traffic assignment principles. The first method, termed as SO-relaxation, exploits the property that an optimal network design solution under SO principle can be a good approximate solution under UE principle, and successively sorts the solutions in the order of increasing total travel time under SO principle. Optimality is guaranteed when the lower bound of the total travel time of the unexplored solutions under UE principle is not less than the total travel time of a known solution under UE principle. The second method, termed as UE-reduction, adds the objective function of the Beckmann-McGuire-Winsten transformation of UE traffic assignment to the constraints of the SO-relaxation formulation of the multi-capacity DNDP. This constraint is convex and strengthens the SO-relaxation formulation. We also develop a dynamic outer-approximation scheme to make use of the state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear programming solvers to solve the SO-relaxation formulation. Numerical experiments based on a two-link network and the Sioux-Falls network are conducted. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Optimal network design for transportation corridors of regional space groups is studied by using combinatorial optimization. The optimal investment model of multimodal transportation corridors is formulated by establishing supply capacity constraint and travel time constraint of transportation corridors. The unit investment cost and the length of transportation corridors is synthetically considered in the model. A method is designed by considering the characteristics of multimodal transportation corridors and the network structure of regional groups, and computational schemes are provided. The efficiency of solution is improved by using a genetic algorithm for large number of nodes. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model and the algorithm is verified through examples, which indicate that the optimal investment scheme is identified to meet transportation demands for planning and the average travel time of each transportation mode. The relationship between transportation demands and transportation corridor design is analyzed, and the results indicate that the model and the solution could be a promising approach to improving the traffic investment programs.

AB  - A combined transportation-land use model is proposed in this paper. Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

But there is one difficulty in how the simulation system can generate network traffics with high accuracy on a much larger time scale. So, in this paper, we present an architecture design for the distributed testing system of generating self-similar network traffic based on parallel methods and implement it via TCP/IP.

AB  - Urban bus route network design involves determining a route configuration with a set of transit routes and associated frequencies that achieves the desired objective. This can be formulated as an optimization problem of minimizing the overall cost (both the user's and the operator's) incurred. In this paper, the use of genetic algorithms (GAs), a search and optimization method based on natural genetics and selection, in solving the route network design problem is reported. The design is done in two phases. First, a set of candidate routes competing for the optimum solution is generated. Second, the optimum set is selected using a GA. The GA is solved by adopting the usual fixed string length coding scheme along with a new variable string length coding proposed in this study. The former assumes a solution route set size, and tries to find that many best routes from the candidate route set, using a GA. The route set size is varied iteratively to find the optimum solution. In the newly proposed variable string length coding method, the solution route set size and the set of solution routes are found simultaneously. The model is applied to a case study network, and results are presented.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A simple example and a more complicated urban-design case study are included to demonstrate the viability of this approach in solving the simultaneous-optimization problem. As a secondary benefit, this set-partitioning model can be reformulated as an integer, generalized-network, flow problem for which new efficient computer codes, capable of solving networks with thousands of nodes and variables, are available.

AB  - In order to alleviate urban traffic problems such as congestion, air pollution, and shortage of fuel, it is necessary to develop public traffic system with priority. A fundamental requirement for bus priority policy is to develop transit flow assignment models in the multimode network. Travelers' choice behaviors, e.g., mode and route choice, are important in modeling transit network flows. This paper develops a combined model for modal split and flow assignment in two modes network to obtain the proportion of traffic demand shared by bus and private car while considering the interactions between these two modes. And then a heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model. At last, a numerical example is used to illustrate the application of the model and algorithm. The results show that the traffic demand of private cars will increase quickly in the congested network for the lower service level of buses.

The congestion pricing models for two time periods (peak and off-peak) and two travel modes (car and bus) on a general urban highway network are constructed and are resolved by an excess-demand approach. A simulation study is conducted to analyze the temporal, spatial and modal effects of congestion tolls. Then the sensitivity analysis of key parameters is conducted to test the stability of the model. The main findings of this study are that congestion pricing schemes are effective in shifting peak time period traffic to the pre-peak time period; diverting traffic from tolled mode to untolled mode and from low occupancy vehicles to high occupancy vehicles. © ASCE.

AB  - Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.

possible distracting effect of the onboard gadget on the driver.
Congestion avoidance may improve traffic safety on the network. Thus,
reducing congestion on freeways by diverting traffic to alternative
arterials is expected to reduce the accident risk on freeways. However,
safety on these arterials may be reduced as they become more congested.
A methodology for predicting changes in accident rates as a result of
traffic diversion by ATIS in Orlando's Transportation Network is
presented

AB  - In this paper, the controllability and H∞ control method of urban transportation network are considered. Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - From the angle of whole trip chain, the paper constructs the passenger flow assignment model in comprehensive transportation network based on the general cost equilibrium through full consideration of the passengers' trip behavioral characteristics. In this model, it is proposed that connection and transfer efficiency among the different transportation modes and urban traffic modes in distribution nodes should be taken into account, whose quantization method and mathematical network transformation method of general cost are also proposed. To solve the model, general cost-flow function is firstly constructed based on different modes and connection-transfer system through considering the links' controlling modes and managing characteristics and the assignment result is obtained through applying the iteration method of all-or-nothing. Finally, the comparative analysis is carried out through taking the comprehensive transportation networks in the Guanzhong-Tianshui economic area as a case to prove the model's validity and Practicality.

AB  - The cell-transmission model-based single-destination system optimal dynamic traffic assignment problem proposed by Ziliaskopoulos was mostly solved by standard linear programming (LP) methods, e.g., simplex and interior point methods, which produce link-based flows involving vehicle-holding phenomenon. In this paper we present a network flow algorithm for this problem. We show that the problem is equivalent to the earliest arrival flow and then solve the earliest arrival flow on a time-expanded network. In particular, a scaled flow scheme is proposed to deal with the situation in which the ratio of backward wave speed to forward wave speed is less than one. The proposed algorithm produces path-based flows exhibiting realistic nonvehicle-holding properties. Complexity and numerical analyses show that the algorithm runs more efficiently than LP.

AB  - Application and extensions of a dynamic network equilibrium model to the Advanced Driver and Vehicle Advisory Navigation Concept (ADVANCE) Network are described in this paper, ADVANCE is a dynamic route guidance field test designed for 800 km(2) in the northwestern suburbs of Chicago. The dynamic route choice model employed in this paper is solved efficiently by a modified version of Janson's DYMOD algorithm. Realistic traffic engineering-based link delay functions, instead of the simplistic Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) function, are used to estimate link travel times and intersection delays for most types of links and intersections. Further, an expanded intersection representation is utilized, resulting in a network of nearly 23,000 links and 10,000 nodes. Time-dependent link flows, travel times, speeds and queue spillbacks are generated for the ADVANCE Network. The model was solved on a CONVEX-C3880. Convergence and computational results are presented and analyzed.

AB  - Phylogenetic methods for the analysis of species data are widely used in evolutionary studies. However, preliminary data transformations and data reduction procedures (such as a size-correction and principal components analysis, PCA) are often performed without first correcting for nonindependence among the observations for species. In the present short comment and attached R and MATLAB code, I provide an overview of statistically correct procedures for phylogenetic size-correction and PCA. I also show that ignoring phylogeny in preliminary transformations can result in significantly elevated variance and type I error in our statistical estimators, even if subsequent analysis of the transformed data is performed using phylogenetic methods. This means that ignoring phylogeny during preliminary data transformations can possibly lead to spurious results in phylogenetic statistical analyses of species data.

AB  - To effectively alleviate traffic pressure of urban arterial roads, optimizing one-way traffic organization is the key to bring microcirculation transportation network into full play. Aiming at reducing the saturation of arterial roads and microcirculation roads, the paper develops the bi-level programming model for optimizing one-way traffic organization with consideration of the maximum saturation restriction. The decision-making variable of the upper level programming is the scheme of one-way traffic organization of branch roads and the optimization targets are to minimize the average saturation of arterial roads and to minimize the excess of saturation over its maximum of arterial roads. The lower level programming is an equilibrium traffic assignment problem under the restrictions of the capacity of arterial roads and branch roads and the maximum saturation. The genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the model. The traffic conditions of arterial roads and microcirculation roads before and after optimizing of one-way traffic organization were compared by an example, which also proves the effectiveness of one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network. The proposed model provides an optimization method for one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network.

This study focuses on urban traffic safety, which is based on analyzing the present situation and the causes of traffic congestion, from the perspective of sustainable transportation, combined with the urban traffic planning theory and traffic intelligent development trends, and puts forward the traffic safety measures. Car networking (Internet of cars) is one part of Internet of things, which is equipped with electronic sensor vehicles for terminals. It connects the vehicle static or dynamic information and the information network platform through the RFID and the wireless data communication technology. Thus, it forms the network that has the function of effective supervision and comprehensive service for all vehicles.

Simultaneously, the feasible route in such augmented transit network is then defined in accordance with the passengers’ behaviors. The passengers’ travel costs including walking time, waiting time, in-vehicle time and transfer time are formulated while the congestions at stations and the congestions in transit vehicles are all taken into account. On the base of these, an equilibrium model for urban transit assignment problem is presented and an improved shortest path method based algorithm is also proposed to solve it.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

The model is approximate and is applicable to networks with many origin-destination pairs and many bottlenecks. Optimality of the solution determined by the model is discussed. It is particularly shown that, unlike in the steady state (Dafermos and Sparrow, 1969), reducing total travel times by using the local marginal delay will not generally result in an optimal solution. Results are provided for two networks.

AB  - Network user equilibrium or user optimum is an ideal state that can hardly be achieved in real traffic. More often than not, every day traffic tends to be in disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, thanks to uncertainties in demand and supply of the network. In this paper we propose a hybrid route choice model for studying non-equilibrium traffic. It combines pre-trip route choice and en-route route choice to solve dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) in large-scale networks. Travelers are divided into two groups, habitual travelers and adaptive travelers. Habitual travelers strictly follow their pre-trip routes which can be generated in the way that major links, such as freeways or major arterial streets, are favored over minor links, while taking into account historical traffic information. Adaptive travelers are responsive to real-time information and willing to explore new routes from time to time. We apply the hybrid route choice model in a synthetic medium-scale network and a large-scale real network to assess its effect on the flow patterns and network performances, and compare them with those obtained from Predictive User Equilibrium (PUE) DTA. The results show that PUE-DTA usually produces considerably less congestion and less frequent queue spillback than the hybrid route choice model. The ratio between habitual and adaptive travelers is crucial in determining realistic flow and queuing patterns. Consistent with previous studies, we found that, in non-PUE DTA, supplying a medium sized group (usually less than 50%) of travelers real-time information is more beneficial to network performance than supplying the majority of travelers with real-time information. Finally, some suggestions are given on how to calibrate the hybrid route choice model in practice to produce realistic results.

In addition, ordinary timed Petri nets model the signal timing plans of the traffic lights controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - As an example of integrating signal control with network traffic assignment, the notion of path-based signal coordination in transportation networks is introduced and illustrated. The use of a real-time dynamic traffic assignment system allows prediction of the traffic flow patterns and identification of the dominant paths in the network. The signalized intersections along these paths, which may consist of combinations of straight sections and turning movements, are coordinated to increase the capacity of the freeway and the surface street system to efficiently absorb diverted traffic from the freeway. A set of experiments is designed to compare the network performance under the path-based coordination scheme with no coordination and arterial-based coordination. The experiments are conducted for both pretimed and vehicle-actuated signal control. An actual network, which represents the south-central part of the Fort Worth area, is used in these experiments. The network consists of a freeway (I-35W) surrounded by a street network with a total of 178 nodes and 441 arcs. The path-based coordination scheme is shown to outperform arterial-based coordination in the cases of both pretimed fixed control and vehicle-actuated signal control. A significant reduction in the network average travel time under the path-based coordination scheme is observed compared with the other schemes. This application further illustrates the benefits of real-time dynamic traffic assignment for advanced traffic management under incident conditions.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to solve shortest path problems in route choice processes when each link's travel time is a fuzzy number, called the Perceived Travel Time (PTT). The PTT is a subjective travel time perceived by a driver. The algorithm solves the fuzzy shortest path problem (FSPA) for drivers in the presence of uncertainty regarding route travel time. For congested networks, the method is able to find the shortest path in terms of perceived travel time and degree of saturation (congestion) along routes at the same time. The FSPA can be used to support the fuzzification of traffic assignment algorithms. The applicability of the resulting FSPA for the traffic assignment was tested in conjunction with incremental traffic loading and was applied to a large-scale real network. The results of the traffic assignment based on the FSPA, User Equilibrium (UE) and a stochastic loading network model (Dial's assignment algorithm) were compared to the observed volume for certain links in the network. We conclude that the proposed method offers better accuracy than the UE or Dial's assignment algorithm for the network under testing.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

The objective is to make an optimal investment decision in order to minimize the total travel cost in the network, while accounting for the route choice behaviors of network users. Because of the computational difficulties experienced with the solution algorithm of nonlinear bi-level mixed integer programming with a large number of 0-1 variables, the discrete network design problem has been recognized as one of the most difficult yet challenging problems in transport. In this paper, at first a traditional bi-level programming model for the discrete network design problem is introduced, and then a new solution algorithm is proposed by using the support function concept to express the relationship between improvement flows and the new additional links in the existing urban network. Finally, the applications of the new algorithm are illustrated with two numerical examples.

In this paper, based on a definition of O-D First-In-First-Out violation, we propose a new dynamical system model of the route choice behavior at the aggregate, route level for both static and dynamic transportation networks. An equilibrium of such a dynamical system can be a user equilibrium or a partial user equilibrium. We prove that, for static, symmetric traffic assignment problem with fixed or variable demand, only user equilibria are stable for the dynamical system, and the objective function in the mathematical programming formulation (Beckmann, McGuire, and Winsten, 1956) can be considered as the potential energy of the dynamical system. We then present an Euler-based perturbation method for finding user equilibrium and solve two examples for both static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. This new model is simple in form and could be applied to analyze other properties of transportation networks.

AB  - Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities grow—their shape and size—will have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growth—that is, transportation routes, land use, and topography—were directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study site—St Louis, Missouri—to predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naïve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naïve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the models’ performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth.

AB  - Full article: Bangkok, Thailand, 16th May 2012—Thai police have seized the carcasses of two Tigers, a Leopard and a Golden Cat from a house in Khan Na Yao, in Bangkok today.  Officers from the Crime Suppression Division and the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police have arrested a Thai man and a Vietnamese man in connection with the crime. All three species are protected in Thailand, and are all listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The animals, found chopped up and stuffed into a freezer in the house, were believed to have been sourced from Malaysia and moved through Sadao, a district in the southern Thai province of Songkla, which shares a border with Malaysia.  Initial investigations have shown the animals were bound for China via Nong Khai, a town near the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.   From Nong Khai, the animals were to be transported across the Mekong River to Lao PDR before being moved to China.  Police said the suspects were paid 8,000 Baht (USD250) to transport the animals from the south of Thailand to Bangkok.  The seized animals have been handed over to the Wildlife First Aid Clinic where samples will be taken for DNA analysis.  “Any DNA analysis should be undertaken with an eye toward establishing the origins of these animals. Going forward, it will be important to know exactly where they came from.” noted TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director, Dr. William Schaedla.  “We also hope the Thai authorities will undertake a thorough investigation of the transport routes being utilized by the smugglers and co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighboring countries. Simply seizing dead animals will not be enough to prevent future losses of tigers and other endangered animals to wildlife trafficking.”  For further images of the haul, please contact Richard Thomas, +44 752 6646216, richard.thomas@traffic.org.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This dissertation involves the development of three key components of the ATMIS: dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), surveillance, and management. Traffic volume (or queue) control scheme is widely used in traffic control practice and has been proven to be effective in managing congestion or gridlock. However, DTA considering the effects of traffic volume control schemes has been missing from literature. To fill this gap, this dissertation considers the analytical traffic volume (queue) control for traffic networks under two route choice behavior assumptions, i.e. dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) and dynamic system optimum (DSO). Existence of equilibrium to the DUE with traffic volume control is proven. The DSO analysis highlights the differences between the dynamic externalities of the two vertical queue models. The results are applied to investigate the traffic induced air pollution pricing. For the surveillance part, this thesis concentrates on the development of a macroscopic traffic flow model to capture traffic dynamics on networks influenced by demand and supply uncertainties. Based on the modified CTM and the switching mode model (SMM) a stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM) is proposed. The uncertain wavefronts are captured by probabilities of occurrence of operational modes which describe different congestion levels. The SCTM is calibrated and validated by several empirical studies. We compare the performance of the SCTM with Monte Carlo Simulation of the MCTM (MCS-MCTM). The results confirm that the SCTM outperforms the MCS-MCTM. We apply the SCTM to estimate the queues and delays at signalized intersections and compare the results with some well-known delay and queue estimation formulas. The comparison results show a good consistency between the SCTM and these formulas. In the traffic management part, optimal and robust decision making problems for managing uncertain network traffic are investigated. The traffic management problems are formulated as stochastic dynamic programming problems. A closed form of optimal control law is derived. The robust decision making problem, which aims to act robustly with respect to the supply uncertainty and to attenuate the effect of demand uncertainty, can be recognized as an equivalent optimal decision making problem. The applications of the proposed methods to incident management are also highlighted.

This paper reviews the latest use of smart cards in securing network, online services, operating systems, and card-holder identity. Smart card network authentication is routinely used on GSM and 3G networks, and this paper shows how the same infrastructure can be extended to perform WiFi access point authentication. Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication. Finally, the paper will show how smart cards and trusted platform module have complementary roles for recuring the operating systems, and the use of smart cards in identity frameworks such as liberty alliance or Microsoft cardspace.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

AB  - A novel user equilibrium traffic assignment model in view of the drivers' different familiar levels with the network is presented in this paper. In the model, drivers are divided into classes according as their knowledge about the network traffic condition and travel-decision characteristics are the same within each class, but differ among classes. Some new concepts, such as OD perceived cost and familiar level with the traffic condition, are introduced based on alpha-cut of fuzzy set. The equilibrium principle is defined based on the similarity measure and can be regarded as a generalization of Wardrop's user equilibrium (UE). A proposed numerical example show that the new model obtains more realistic results than the other two models, UE and SUE.

Propose a bi-level uncertain model with robust optimizations. In the upper-level problem, the costs of expansion are uncertain by adding random variables to the cost function coefficients. Every random variable belongs to [0,1]. In the lower-level problem, the demand between each origin-destination pair is uncertain and belongs to a bounded interval and an ellipsoid. Then apply a genetic algorithm combined with the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to solve the model. Numerical examples suggest that the robust model with uncertain data has the advantage of operability and stability over the deterministic model.

AB  - The problem of finding the most cost efficient network design by considering two or more demand matrices that represent varying network traffic over several time periods, is referred to as multi-hour net- work design. Capacity installations need to be determined such that the network is robust enough to allow routing of the demand matrices non-simultaneously. In the paper the multi-hour network design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and the solution approach is based on a branch-and-cut framework that incorporates several classes of valid inequalities. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of problem reduction on computing times. Results from domination theory are applied to reduce the number of non-simultaneous traffic demand matrices to a so-called dominant (sub-)set. That is, matrices from the original data set are removed which do not change the solution space of a feasible network. In addi- tion, strategies for strengthening the right-hand side of metric inequalities are presented and computational results are provided based on measurements from an operational network.

AB  - In a recent paper a traffic assignment model has been constructed in which the cost on a link may depend not only on its load, but also on the loads on other links of the network. In this paper it is shown that this model is also capable of handling the case of several classes of users in the same transportation network each of which has an individual cost function and, at the same time, contributes to its own and other classes' cost functions in an individual way. Typical applications arise not only in street networks where vehicles of different types share the same roads (e.g., trucks and passenger cars) but also in other types of transportation networks (e.g., telephone networks). An algorithm is constructed for finding the system-optimizing flow pattern for such a multiclass-user transportation network.

In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transportation planning models do not usually consider intersection delays explicitly in calculating path travel times. However, because intersection delays often make up a considerable portion of total travel time in urban areas, ignoring them will result in inaccuracy in model results. Incorporating intersection delays into a traffic assignment model presents several challenges. One is that future signal timing plans are unknown, and another is that introducing intersection delays into traffic assignment renders the necessary condition for convergence invalid. This paper proposes a pragmatic approach to considering intersection delays in traffic assignment by assuming that signal timing plans will be optimized for given traffic conditions and by demonstrating that a convergent solution can be obtained when intersection delays are explicitly accounted for. A large data set of traffic volume combinations representing the operation of an intersection and the corresponding intersection delays based on optimized signal timing are obtained from TRANSYT-7F. This data set is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model that provides delay estimates for given traffic conditions for certain types of intersection configurations. An iterative process of traffic assignment and delay estimation is carried out to obtain a stable assignment solution. The delay estimates from the ANN delay model are evaluated by the percentage root mean squared errors, which are less than 25.6%, with larger prediction errors typically associated with severely oversaturated conditions. An example is presented to show the use of the delay model in traffic assignment. The delay model allows the concurrent optimization of signal controls and traffic routing to obtain a local optimum network solution.

AB  - A multicommodity discrete kinematic wave model that possesses the theoretical rigor and computational efficiency inherent in the kinematic wave theory is proposed for simulating network traffic flow. In this model, fluxes through boundaries and junctions are computed systematically under the supply-demand framework. In addition, traffic is modeled by commodity type so that the effects of geometric characteristics of a road network on traffic dynamics can be captured. Although traffic is not ordered down to the vehicle level as in existing kinematic wave simulation models, the noncompliance with the first-in-first-out property in this model is still of the order of Δ t , the time increment. Hence travel times in the average sense can be defined from cumulative curves. Finally, the evolution of traffic dynamics in a sample road network is shown to demonstrate the stability, numerical convergence, and soundness of the proposed network kinematic wave model.

AB  - A robust optimization model is presented for the dynamic traffic assignment-based continuous network design problem, which accounts for a bilevel objective and long-term origin-destination demand uncertainty. The model also embeds Daganzo's cell transmission model. The objective minimizes the trade-off between expected total system travel time (TSTT) and expected risk. As such, the robust model provides the optimal solution that is least sensitive to the variation of travel demand, given the degree of robustness by transportation planners. The new robust model is compared with the existing network design models on a simple cell transmission test network. The robust model with greater degree of robustness yields less expected risk with the sacrifice of higher expected TSTT. The robust model yields the most robust solution, and no other model provides a satisfactory solution across the budget range. In addition, how a visualized graph may be used to elicit the preference information from transportation planners on the desired degree of robustness is illustrated.

AB  - This paper proposes a bi-level model for network design problem (NDP) under demand uncertainty. Most of the conventional NDPs are carried out under deterministic condition. Only a few studies pay attention to NDPs under uncertainty in transportation networks. In this paper, the conventional NDP is extended to explicitly take into account the demand uncertainty, which refers to the fluctuations of day-to-day total number of vehicular trips between an origin-destination pair during the observational window. Under such uncertain condition, travel times are no longer deterministic and travelers have to consider risk-taking path choice behaviors. The corresponding reliability-based traffic assignment model is adopted as the lower-level problem of the bi-level model. The upper-level problem utilizes the expected total system travel time as the objective function for determining the optimal capacity enhancement scheme. An Iterative-Optimization-Assignment algorithm is developed to solve the bi-level model. In the numerical example, it is found that travelers' risk-taking behaviors have significant impact on the results of NDP under uncertain condition.

AB  - To determine the optimal investments on road network of comprehensive transportation system, a bi-level programming model for continuous network design problem was employed. At the upper level problem, planner makes investment decision in links and hubs of a comprehensive transportation system to minimize the total times costs plus investment costs and the external costs such as environment pollution, land use and energy exhaustion. At the lower level, users choose their paths in accordance with deterministic user equilibrium. We design an algorithm based on extremal optimization to solve the upper level problem, in which only investments on those links and hubs with high marginal cost are updated randomly at each step to combine the merits of gradient-based methods and intelligent heuristics. Numerical comparison was made on a grid network with 9 nodes and 14 links. The result shows that the algorithm is competitive with gradient-based and simulated annealing methods.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - This paper investigates the performance of accessibility-based equity measurements in transportation and proposes a multiobjective optimization model to simulate the trade-offs between equity maximization and cost minimization of network construction. The equity is defined as the spatial distribution of accessibilities across zone areas. Six representative indicators were formulated, including GINI coefficient, Theil index, mean log deviation, relative mean deviation, coefficient of variation, and Atkinson index, and incorporated into an equity maximization model to evaluate the performance sensitivity. A bilevel multiobjective optimization model was proposed to obtain the Pareto-optimal solutions for link capacity enhancement in a stochastic road network design problem. A numerical analysis using the Sioux Falls data was implemented. Results verified that the equity indicators are quite sensitive to the pattern of network scenarios in the sense that the level of equity varies according to the amount of overall capacity enhancement as well as the assignment of improved link segments. The suggested multiobjective model that enables representing the Pareto-optimal solutions can provide multiple options in the decision making of road network design. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Agile electronics manufacturing requires integrated design, supply and manufacturing planning for modular products where suppliers and manufacturing resources are network distributed. This research is concerned with the modeling of such a distributed manufacturing network. The performance of network-based distributed decision systems is dominated by the network configuration and related access delays. Recent traffic measurement studies observed heavy-tails in the network traffic. Our basic approach is based on the quantile match to fit hyperexponential distributions to heavy-tailed distributions. We adopt the ON/OFF network traffic model and compare the fitted hyperexponential model with the heavy-tailed model. The results validate our fitting hyperexponentials. Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets (GSPNs) are introduced to analyze both the steady state and the transient behaviors of the distributed system. The results indicate that the transient analysis is more important than the steady-state analysis in network traffic modeling, since in most cases the distributed network does not reach the steads state.

AB  - In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

World leaders gathering in New York for the global body’s 67th annual meeting highlighted wildlife trafficking along with other severe threats to the rule of law such as corruption and drug running.  In a written statement, permanent Security Council member United States highlighted “the harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts, rule of law, governance and economic development.” The rapidly-growing illicit international trade in endangered species products, such as rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger parts, is now estimated to be worth $5 billion per year globally.   “Such organized crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing,” Gabon’s President Ali Bongo said during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. “Gabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon. But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperation.”   Permanent member France also emphasized the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime. “There are still entire sectors of activity without any legal safety,” French Minister Delegate for Development Pascal Canfin said. “International law is lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural resources, for example, or the trafficking of fauna.”   President Bongo took the occasion to reaffirm his country’s commitment to “combating violations of the Convention on International Trade [in] Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora as well as other conventions to protect the environment and biodiversity.”  In response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa, President Bongo oversaw the burning of Gabon’s seized ivory stockpile earlier this year after a full audit supported by WWF and TRAFFIC. Organized criminal syndicates, sometimes linked to armed insurgent groups, are believed to be behind many of the tens of thousands of elephant poaching deaths occurring in Africa each year. Ivory tusks are highly valuable on Asian black markets.   “Illicit wildlife trafficking can have severe consequences for people as well as the environment, yet it is not considered a serious crime by many governments. It is often a low risk and high profit criminal activity, which is a dangerous combination,” said Wendy Elliott, WWF Global Species Programme Manager. “Governments have made a significant step forward by introducing the issue into this important forum on the rule of law. We now call on all them to increase their law enforcement responses to wildlife crime on a commensurate basis.” Roland Melisch, Director of TRAFFIC’s Africa & Europe programmes said: “Good governance is essential to prevent crimes such as illicit wildlife trafficking. Countries need to be held accountable to their commitments under relevant United Nations treaties.”  WWF and its partner TRAFFIC, the wildlife monitoring network, are campaigning for greater protection of threatened species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants. In order to save endangered animals, source, transit and demand countries must all improve law enforcement, customs controls and judicial systems. WWF and TRAFFIC are also urging governments in consumer countries to undertake demand reduction efforts to curb the use of endangered species products.

AB  - Network design problem has originated in the practice of traffic engineering. Planning and designing road system has always been the most important task of traffic engineers. The objective of network design problem is to plan and design an improvement project for a road network systematically so that the total travel cost of the whole road system is minimized. Because of the complexity of the models, which are expressed as non-convex and bi-level programming, satisfactory solutions of network design problem are rather difficult to obtain by the traditional non-linear optimization algorithms. The paper has studied the models of network design problem and has designed a genetic algorithm. With a test road network as an example, it has shown the application of the new genetic algorithm to network design problem. Impacts of a model parameter upon solutions are then carefully analyzed and some meaningful conclusions and suggestions have been drawn.

AB  - To improve performance of public traffic network, the hierarchy method of choosing optimum lines (HMCOL) is proposed. By HMCOL, the lines of public traffic network are classified by three layers: backbone lines, limb lines, and branch lines, then the traffic lines of different layers are chosen by those specified roles on network and are integrated into hierarchy network, thus making whole traffic network cost-effective and advisable. So, the shortcoming of neglecting branch lines assignment of conventional method is overcome. The HMCOL principles and basic procedure for traffic network design are introduced. Especially, the construction of hierarchy model for choosing lines, and the traffic network adjusting method with heuristic idea are described. A classic example is adopted to validate HMCOL. It can be seen from experimental analysis that compared with the other research results, the public traffic network designed by HMCOL owns higher network coverage rate, and lower lines overlapping rate, and meets other function demand of the public traffic design.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - In the urban traffic network, the trip generations of every origin and trip attractions of every destination are closely related to the economic level of the traffic zone, land use, population, and the other factors, generally accurately forecast, although the demands between the origin and the destination are difficult to accurately predict. In this paper, we assume that the trip generations of every origin and trip attractions of every destination are deterministic, but the demands between every origin and destination are uncertain and belong to a bounded interval. We propose a min-max model of continuous network design with demand uncertainty under user equilibrium with robust optimizations. For our proposed model, we apply sensitivity analysis combined with the methods of sequence average algorithm to solve the robust model. Numerical examples demonstrate that the robust solutions of the continuous network design are more reliable than the deterministic solutions.

AB  - From the mid nineteenth century, the City of Dessau (Germany) developed as an economic centre. The development of new residential and industrial areas changed the natural landscape having an adverse impact on the surface water, soil water and groundwater regimes. Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - This paper presents a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model for urban multi-modal transportation network by con­structing a mesoscopic simulation model. Several traffic means such as private car, subway, bus and bicycle are con­sidered in the network. The mesoscopic simulator consists of a mesoscopic supply simulator based on MesoTS model and a time-dependent demand simulator. The mode choice is si­multaneously considered with the route choice based on the improved C-Logit model. The traffic assignment procedure is implemented by a time-dependent shortest path (TDSP) al­gorithm in which travellers choose their modes and routes based on a range of choice criteria. The model is particularly suited for appraising a variety of transportation management measures, especially for the application of Intelligent Trans­port Systems (ITS). Five example cases including OD demand level, bus frequency, parking fee, information supply and car ownership rate are designed to test the proposed simulation model through a medium-scale case study in Beijing Chaoy­ang District in China. Computational results illustrate excel­lent performance and the application of the model to analy­sis of urban multi-modal transportation networks.

AB  - Nowadays, the environmental impact of transportation project and, especially air pollution impacts, are major concerns in evaluating transportation projects. Based on this concern, beside definition of traditional objective functions like total travel time and total investment cost, different type of environmental related function is considered as objective function in urban network design. In this paper, the continuous network design problem (CNDP) is formulated as a multi-objective bi-level optimization problem. The objective function of the upper level problem is a weighted combination of total travel time, total investment cost and total vehicular emission in the network. The lower level problem is the traffic assignment problem which would predict the vehicular flow on each link in the network. A new solution algorithm is proposed for solving the bi-level optimization problem by the partial linearization of the lower level problem. The solution algorithm was applied to the city of Sioux Falls, a well known transportation network.

AB  - By exploring of the multi-period network design problem of comprehensive transport, the paper proposes a bi-level programming model with uncertain demand. The upper level problem is to maximize the consumer surplus of all demand scenarios with budget constraint. While under the network investment decisions of the upper level problem, the lower level problem is to maximize the consumer surplus of every demand scenario with consideration of the collaborations of transportation modes, traffic load balancing and capacity constraints. Then, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. Compared with the existing research, the proposed model can simultaneously optimize the final form of the comprehensive transport network and construction timing. The model considers all the annual coordination between transportation infrastructure construction and demand. It reflects the cooperation and balanced development of transportation modes, and makes the decision support more effective for the gradual improvement of the regional comprehensive transport network.

Unlike the pure Wardrop equilibrium, this study deals with the problem of user equilibrium traffic assignment with game theory. We present a Stackelberg game on the network in which the SO player is the leader and the Cournot-Nash and user equilibrium players are the followers. The Cournot-Nash and user equilibrium players select the route, which is given the SO player's routing. In contrast, the SO player select the routes to minimize total system travel cost. Based on combined model, the traffic assignment method was discussed, and the VI and generalized Lagrange multiplier method was used to get the solution. A simple example is presented. The example result shows that the efficient of Stackelberg model is higher than that of the UE system or SO system.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

The method is based on previous work by Tobin and Friesz (Transportation Science 22(4), 242-250, 1988) to bypass the uniqueness requirement in standard sensitivity analysis frameworks for variational inequalities, and exploits the finite-dimensional formulation of the model in terms of path flow variables given by Leurent (Transportation and Traffic Theory, pp. 455-477.

AB  - This paper proposes an investigation of bidimensional modeling for traffic flows in a large and dense network of an urban area. The network is viewed as a continuum of orthotropic roads. This (and the side-constraints) constitutes the main research contributions of the paper. Each point of the area is characterized by a travel cost and a side constraint that depend on the privileged directions. A side constraint is a means to obtain a more precise description of traffic flow as far as it does not allow it to exceed the capacity of the roads (Larsson & Patriksson, 1995; Taguchi & Iri, 1982). Each destination is characterized both by a monotonic strictly decreasing function to reflect the customers' elastic demand with respect to the total cost (Yang & Wong, 2000) and a satisfaction function to reflect the customers' gain as entering the desired destination. The study deals with a multicommodity traffic assignment. We suppose that there are a few destinations for the commuters in the area. All the commuters are uniformly distributed in the area and try to reach their destination. A commodity is defined as the traffic flows from the area to one of the destinations (Yang & Wong, 2000). We express equilibrium as a primal problem which is the minimization of a mathematical convex program (Yang, Yagar & Iida, 1994) adapted to the orthotropic case. This program is inspired from the Beckmann objective function (Beckmann, 1952). To solve this program, we use a Lagrangian scheme and a dual method. This technique provides a potential function that explains the flows of traffic over the city, and the over costs generated by the saturated flows. We prove that the solution fits with the User Equilibrium principle (Wardrop, 1952). We apply the model to the case of Paris urban area, where we put an orthotropic network. The commuters are uniformly distributed on the city, and try to reach some destinations located on the ring on-ramps. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The usual concept of asymptotic independence, as discussed in the context of extreme value theory, requires the distribution of the coordinatewise sample maxima under suitable centering and scaling to converge to a product measure. However, this definition is too broad to conclude anything interesting about the tail behavior of the product of two random variables that are asymptotically independent. Here we introduce a new concept of asymptotic independence which allows us to study the tail behavior of products, We carefully discuss equivalent formulations of asymptotic independence. We then use the concept in the study of a network traffic model. The usual infinite source Poisson network model assumes that sources begin data transmissions at Poisson time points and continue for random lengths of time. It is assumed that the data transmissions proceed at a constant, nonrandom rate over the entire length of the transmission. However, analysis of network data suggests that the transmission rate is also random with a regularly varying tail. So, we modify the usual model to allow transmission sources to transmit at a random rate over the length of the transmission. We assume that the rate and the time have finite mean, infinite variance and possess asymptotic independence, as defined in the paper. We finally prove a limit theorem for the input process showing that the centered cumulative process under a suitable scaling converges to a totally skewed stable Levy motion in the sense of finite-dimensional distributions.

AB  - The management of severe congestion in complex urban networks calls for dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models that can replicate real traffic situations with long queues and spillbacks. DynaMIT-P, a mesoscopic traffic simulation system, was enhanced and calibrated to capture the traffic characteristics in a sub-area of Beijing, China. The network had 1698 nodes and 3180 directed links in an area of around 18 square miles. There were 2927 non-zero origin-destination (OD) pairs and around 630,000 vehicles were simulated over 4 h of the morning peak. All demand and supply parameters were calibrated simultaneously using sensor counts and floating car travel time data. Successful calibration was achieved with the Path-size Logit route choice model, which accounted for overlapping routes. Furthermore, explicit representations of lane groups were required to properly model traffic delays and queues. A modified treatment of acceptance capacity was required to model the large number of short links in the transportation network (close to the length of one vehicle). In addition, even though bicycles and pedestrians were not explicitly modeled, their impacts on auto traffic were captured by dynamic road segment capacities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - A study was done to formulate and solve the multiobjective network design problem with uncertain demand. Various samples of demand are realized for optimal improvements in the network while the objectives of the expected total system travel time and the higher moment for total system travel time are minimized. A formulation is proposed for multiobjective robust network design, and a solution methodology is developed on the basis of a revised fast and elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. The developed methodology has been tested on the Nguyen-Dupuis network, and various Pareto optimal solutions are compared with earlier work on the single-objective robust network design problem. A real medium-size network was solved to prove efficacy of the model. The results show better solutions for the multiobjective robust network design problem with relatively less computational effort.

AB  - Most existing dynamic traffic assignment models assume that drivers have sufficient knowledge on roadway networks. However, past experiments have shown that drivers' familiarity with the network layout is an essential component in route selections. In this paper, the concept of recognition level is defined to categorize drivers based on their unfamiliarity of the network and of the alternative routes between origins and destinations. Each catalog is assigned a specific utility function that is dependent on travel time, length of route and recognition parameters. Drivers' route choice behavior is determined by these specific utility functions. A sample network is first employed to test the feasibility of the proposed model, and the result complies with the specified travel patterns. After that, a real network near downtown Houston is used to further test the proposed model. An experiment is conducted based on the information collected from an on-site survey and the on-line realtime traffic map from Houston TranStar. In order to validate the necessity of the proposed model, a control experiment is carried out with all parameters being set in the same way as the designed experiment except that drivers are assumed to be fully familiar with the network layout and alternative routes. Test results show that the proposed model better fit the real case.

AB  - In the 1990s intelligent networks (INs) will carry and deliver
multimedia services, personal communication services (PCS), and other
diverse and complex services. These services require multiple triggering
within the service switching points (SSP), multiple queries to the
service control points (SCPs), and a reliable signaling network. In this
environment the risk of overloading the network elements (e.g., SSPs,
SCPs) are real and managing the traffic in this environment is a
challenge. Overloads may be caused by general widespread loads above
engineered levels or focused originating or terminating high-intensity
calling (or messaging) levels. The traffic overloads experienced may
also be secondary effects of network system failures or major equipment
outages. This paper discusses the various overload controls on the
network elements and the network management via operations systems
(OSs). It analyzes various scenarios and proposes solutions for the
network elements and the OSs for managing overloads

AB  - Two continuous time formulations of the dynamic traffic assignment problem are considered, one that corresponds to system optimization and the other to a version of user optimization on a single mode network using optimal control theory. Pontryagin's necessary conditions are analyzed and given economic interpretations that correspond to intuitive notions regarding dynamic system optimized and dynamic user optimized traffic flow patterns. Notably, we offer the first dynamic generalization of Beckmann's equivalent optimization problem for static user optimized traffic assignment in the form of an optimal control problem. The analysis further establishes that a constraint qualification and convexity requirements for the Hamiltonian, which together ensure that the necessary conditions are also sufficient, are satisfied under commonly encountered regularity conditions.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - In general, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) is formulated as a bilevel program. The objective function at the upper level is defined as the total travel time on the network, plus total investment costs of link capacity expansions. The lower level problem is formulated as a certain traffic assignment model. It is well known that such bilevel program is nonconvex and algorithms for finding global optimal solutions are preferable to be used in solving it. Simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA) are two global methods and can then be used to determine the optimal solution of CNDP. Since the application of SA and GA on continuous network design on real transportation network requires solving traffic assignment model many times at each iteration of the algorithm, computation time needed is tremendous. It is important to compare the efficacy of the two methods and choose the more efficient one as reference method in practice. In this paper, the continuous network design problem has been studied using SA and GA on a simulated network. The lower level program is formulated as user equilibrium traffic assignment model and Frank-Wolf method is used to solve it. It is found that when demand is large, SA is more efficient than GA in solving CNDP, and much more computational effort is needed for GA to achieve the same optimal solution as SA. However, when demand is light, GA can reach a more optimal solution at the expense of more computation time. It is also found that increasing the iteration number at each temperature in SA does not necessarily improve solution. The finding in this example is different from [Karoonsoontawong, A., & Waller, S. T. (2006). Dynamic continuous network design problem - Linear bilevel programming and metaheuristic approaches. Transportation Research Record (1964), 104-117, Network Modeling 2006.]. The reason might be the bi-level model in this example is nonlinear while the bi-level model in their study is linear. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The problem is formulated as a two-phase stochastic program in which the schedule of regular and ad hoc services are derived sequentially. An example is presented to illustrate the formulation. We then apply the proposed method to the case of ferry network design in Hong Kong. In terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, the SR-based approach shows promising results as compared with existing methods. Moreover, the approach leads to substantial cost savings as compared with deterministic methods under demand uncertainty.

In this paper, we simplify a fluidodynamic traffic model and derive a new traffic flow model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is obtained by spatial discretization of an averaged density evolution and a suitable approximation of the coupling conditions at junctions of the network. We show that the new model inherits similar features of the full model, e.g., traffic jam propagation. We consider optimal control problems controlled by the ODE model and derive the optimality system.

AB  - Time-lapse aerial photography over the Central Business Districts (CBD) of Austin and Dallas, Texas, has been employed to determine the averages of concentration, speed and fraction of vehicles stopped and to examine the relations among such network-wide averages including the flow which was measured on the ground simultaneously. The results have indicated that the average flow in a street network may indeed be expressed as the product of the space mean speed and concentration. Simultaneous ground experiments have also been conducted in the Austin CBD to investigate the reasonableness of the assumptions of the "two-fluid model," a curvilinear relation between the trip time and stop time per unit distance, which may be used in characterizing the quality of traffic service in urban street networks. As a result of these simultaneous ground experiments and aerial observations, the assumptions of the model have been verified. Moreover, relations between the fraction of vehicles stopped and concentration as well as between speed and concentration have allowed the two-fluid model to be used to compare the quality of traffic service in various street networks under the same level of concentration. The two-fluid model may then be used to predict, for a given change in vehicular concentration in a street network, the resulting changes in the averages of speed, fraction of vehicles stopped, flow, etc. This is particularly useful as a performance model in urban planning where for a given concentration it is desirable to predict the resulting traffic conditions.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a multiclass, multicriteria traffic network equilibrium model in which travelers of a class perceive their travel disutility or generalized cost on a route as a weighting of travel time and travel cost, each of which is flow-dependent. In addition, the weights are not only class-dependent but also link-dependent. The model is an elastic demand model and allows the demand function for each class and origin/destination (O/D) pair to depend, in general, upon the disutilities of all classes at all O/D pairs. The formulation of the governing equilibrium conditions, as well as the qualitative analysis, and the computational procedure, are based on finite-dimensional variational inequality theory. The model provides an alternative to existing multimodal and multicriteria traffic network equilibrium models and has location choice implications as well. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field “science of complexity” has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Today’s self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic “patterns”. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially “enslaves” its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the “higher” level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the “lower” levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

In this study a bi-level programming model was proposed to optimize the strategy of transportation network capacity improvement in the constraint of budget. The upper level problem aims to minimize the total travel time of all transportation travelers, while the lower level model is users' equilibrium transportation assignment model. A quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm was employed to solve the problem. The result of numerical experiment indicated that the proposed model can reduce total travel time by searching optimal solution and the QEA is more efficient than other heuristic algorithm.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - Full article: Alor Star, Malaysia, 7th February 2013—A court case involving Malaysia’s biggest ever seizure of trafficked Tiger parts today saw the conviction of a 29-year old man, who was sentenced to a total 60 months in prison. However Mohd Nor Shahrizam Nasir, found guilty on two charges of illegal possession of Tiger parts and one for possession of African Elephant ivory, will only serve 24 months in jail as the judge ordered that his sentences run concurrently. A conviction under the section of the law involving Tiger parts also carries a mandatory fine of "not less than RM100,000 and not more than RM500,000 and a jail term not exceeding five years.” However, the court did not issue the mandatory fine. In February last year, he was arrested at this home where Wildlife Department officers found eight Tiger skins, 22 bags of Tiger skulls and bones and nine African Elephant tusks.  Mohd Nor Shahrizam, from the town of Alor Star in northern Peninsular Malaysia claimed trial to charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010. This morning he was handed down a sentence of 24 months each on the charges of keeping the eight Tiger skins, and the 22 Tiger skulls and bones. He received a further 12-month jail term on the third charge of keeping African Elephant tusks. Judge Mohd Rosli Osman granted the defence a stay pending an appeal and ordered that the convicted man’s bail, initially set at RM70,000, be increased by an additional RM10,000. If Mohd Nor Shahrizam raises bail, he will be free pending his appeal.   TRAFFIC welcomed the conviction but noted its concern that the sentence imposed contradicted the provision of the laws under which Mohd Nor Shahrizam was charged. “This is shocking given that the mandatory fine is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is also disappointing considering it has taken 13 years of hard work and the effort of so many to include a punitive minimum fine for heinous wildlife crimes,” said TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director Dr William Schaedla. TRAFFIC has learnt that the prosecution will seek a revision of the sentence. Schaedla also disagreed with the argument raised by the defence during the trial; that the crime in question was insignificant because it did not involve loss of life. “Such arguments fail to recognize that the arrest in this case was linked to the largest Tiger seizure Malaysia has ever seen – eight skins and the skulls and bones of 22 Tigers were impounded from the culprit’s Alor Star residence,” he said. “It also contradicts recent international developments that are putting wildlife crime on a par with other serious crimes such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking.” “The short jail term and the lack of a fine are a demoralizing finale to what should have been a victory against wildlife crime. We hope the lapse does not crush the spirit of those authorities who are still working hard to protect Malaysia’s 500 remaining Tigers.”

Those associated primarily with food, ornamental use, timber or fuel have been excluded. The report examines the exploitation of native European medicinal and aromatic plants, investigates the trade of medicinal and aromatic plants in Europe, and recommends actions to ensure the legal and sustainable use of the taxa involved. The findings are based on country-specific surveys carried out in Albania, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Turkey and the UK during 1994-97. International trade data from the UNCTAD Comtrade database were also analysed. In Europe, at least 2000 species are used on a commercial basis, some 1200-1300 of which are native to Europe. Of these, 90% are still wild collected (some 20 000-30 000 t/yr). Wild collection is particularly prominent in Albania, Turkey, Hungary and Spain. In the EU, medicinal and aromatic plants are cultivated on an estimated 70 000 ha, the main countries being France, Hungary and Spain. Analysis of trade data revealed that Europe imports about a quarter of annual global market imports (440 000 t valued at $1.3 billion in 1996). Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK are among the 12 leading countries of import and Germany, Bulgaria and Poland are among the 12 leading countries of export. Legislation relating to the harvest and trade of medicinal and aromatic plants in Europe is considered. In national reports, about 150 species were reported to be threatened in at least one European country as a result of over-collection from the wild. Detailed descriptions of 15 taxa reported as threatened are presented. Species subjected to international, European or national legislation and/or reported as threatened in a number of reports are tabulated. The recommendations made in this report for the conservation of medicinal and aromatic plant species propose action in the spheres of trade monitoring; adjustments to legislation; improvement to law enforcement; regulation, in particular, of the trade in orchid bulbs used for salep; in situ and ex situ protection; improved management programmes; public awareness initiatives; enhancement of cultivation efforts; future research into trade in wild-harvested plants; and certification of plant material from sustainable sources.

AB  - For a local area road network, the available traffic data of traveling are the flow volumes in the key intersections, not the complete OD matrix. Considering the circumstance characteristic and the data availability of a local area road network, a new model for traffic assignment based on Monte Carlo simulation of intersection turning movement is provided in this paper. For good stability in temporal sequence, turning ratio is adopted as the important parameter of this model. The formulation for local area road network assignment problems is proposed on the assumption of random turning behavior. The traffic assignment model based on the Monte Carlo method has been used in traffic analysis for an actual urban road network. The results comparing surveying traffic flow data and determining flow data by the previous model verify the applicability and validity of the proposed methodology. © 2009 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.

AB  - A two-layer transportation network design model with three
objectives is introduced. The objectives are: the minimization of the
primary path length (or traveling time) from a predetermined starting
node to a predetermined terminus node; the minimization of the total
distance traversed by the demand to reach a node on the primary path;
and the minimization of the total network construction cost. The problem
is initially formulated as an integer linear programming model. A
combinatoric solution which would be suitable for small networks because
of the large size of the subtour breaking constraints is presented. The
method produces efficient solutions according to the objectives
mentioned above. The criteria of alternate transportation facilities,
environmental concerns, and socio-economic structure are included for
these efficient solutions. By using Zeleny's ideal point approach the
best compromise solution is then selected. The results of a numerical
example are also given. Some potential applications of the model include
the planning of a new highway or rapid transportation system and the

Following a recent, heuristic by ant colony optimization (ACO), a hybridized ACO (HACO) has been devised and tested on the network of Sioux Falls, showing that the hybrid is more effective to solve the problem. In this paper, employing the heuristic of particle swarm optimization (PSO), an algorithm is designed to solve the TNDP. Application of the algorithm on the Sioux Falls test network shows that the performance of PSO algorithm is comparable with HACO. ?? 2011.

AB  - Traffic congestion has become a stringent issue in urban areas. Traffic control systems are designed to make a better use of the existing traffic infrastructures in order to improve traffic conditions. Along with the fast development of the transportation infrastructures, traffic networks become larger and more complex. Therefore, network-wide traffic control systems that can coordinate the whole network and improve the utilization of the entire traffic infrastructure, are highly required. In this paper, a structured network-wide traffic controller is presented based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) theory. Two macroscopic models are proposed to be the prediction model of the MPC controller. One is more accurate, but correspondingly requires more computation time; the other sacrifices a certain amount of accuracy, but is computationally much more efficient. Based on these two models, MPC controllers are developed. Simulation results show that the MPC controllers are capable of coordinating an urban traffic network, especially in the situations that the traffic flow is not spread evenly through the network. Through reducing the prediction model, the corresponding MPC controller exhibits less on-line computational burden, and thus becomes more applicable in practice. Therefore, it becomes possible for the control system to deal with complex urban road networks more efficiently. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Full article: A project to promote sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plants in the mountains of China’s Upper Yangtze ecoregion has won the prestigious Equator Prize 2012.   The Equator Prize recognizes outstanding local initiatives working to advance sustainable development solutions for people, nature and resilient communities in countries receiving support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).   It is the second time the success of the project has been publicly acknowledged; in October 2011, the project received an “Outstanding Contribution Award” from the Chinese State Ministry of Environmental Protection, EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), Ministry of Commerce and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Over-harvesting of wild medicinal plant species is a serious conservation concern—aside from problems caused by the harvesting itself, the collectors can also have serious secondary impacts through camping within reserves, hunting and gathering fuel-wood to dry commercial quantities of medicinal plants. Such habitat destruction and disturbance also threatens endangered wildlife, including the Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the Takin Budorcas taxicolor.   The collection of medicinal plants in the Upper Yangtze is rising, with households compensating for loss of income from farming and timber logging due to the promulgation of two policies: a 1998 logging ban and a “Grain for Green” programme, introduced in 2000, which discourages farming on steep slopes.  To help alleviate matters, an initiative was developed through a comprehensive collaboration between WWF, IUCN and TRAFFIC as part of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), which led to local producer association members, harvesters and governmental officials receiving training in the implementation of organic wild crop harvesting practices and certification procedures, as well as application of the FairWild Standard principles.   “We are delighted to see public recognition of the success of this initiative, which has demonstrated how sustainable harvesting of wild plant resources creates positive benefits for local livelihoods and conservation efforts,” said Anastasiya Timoshyna, TRAFFIC’s Medicinal Plant Programme Leader.  Income for local producers in the project areas has increased, thanks to higher prices paid for certified sustainably harvested medicinal and aromatic plants. In the case of Schisandra berries Schisandra sphenanthera, international and local buyers paid at least 30% above normal market prices for certified produce. A survey of project sites in March 2011 found incomes from medicinal plant collection had risen, thanks to the certification schemes; in one village by almost 18% over 2007 levels.   The project also led to the establishment of links between producer associations and buyer groups: two communities have signed purchase agreements with a local winery and the newly established Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Cooperative has signed a 5-year fair trade agreement with a Californian company for supply of sustainably harvested Schisandra fruits.   In 2010, more than 5 tonnes (dry weight) of Schisandra fruits were sustainably harvested of which more than 3 tonnes were sold to Draco Natural Products (DNP Shanghai) for production of a concentrated dry extract specified by US-based Traditional Medicinals Inc (TMI). The project has scaled up from one village in the 2008 and 2009 harvests up to 22 villages in the 2011 harvest. From the autumn 2011 harvest, about 11.5 tonnes were shipped to DNP, enough to produce about 1.2 tonnes of certified organic dried extract for use in TMI products.   Further development of the project, supported through the Kangmei Institute of Community Development and Marketing has seen further adoption of sustainable harvesting methods in the region, and communities working through international partnerships to promote a ‘giant panda friendly’ brand and to create panda friendly certification standards for local harvesters.   “This project is proving that local harvesters from villages surrounding the Giant Panda conservation area can successfully implement meaningful sustainability standards,” said Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability for TMI.  “The Schisandra harvesters are helping to protect the panda bear habitat from disturbance while working to conserve biodiversity and earning additional household income through an organic and fair price premium.  “Traditional Medicinals remains committed to a long-term equitable trade relationship with the 22 participating villages represented by the Shuijing TCM Cooperative.   “Schisandra is only the first success story. As other wild medicinal plant species are added to the cooperative’s sustainable wild harvesting management plan, with eventual certified organic and panda friendly designations, household income will increase as a result of empowering and rewarding local communities for the important work of nature conservation.”

AB  - In transportation engineering, the network design problem (NDP) aims at\nfinding an optimal link improvement in a network for given demand.\nAlthough traffic demand is essentially uncertain, many previous studies\nassumed it to be deterministic. The demand stochasticity is incorporated\nand formulas are developed for system-optimal (SO) flow stochastic NDP.\nThe SO assumption is justified by comparing results from SO\ndeterministic NDP with those of user-equilibrium NDP. The difference in\nsocial cost between the two approaches is found to be less than 5%. Two\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with recourse formulations are proposed:\none with penalty function and the other without. The main advantage of\nthe first formulation is that a planner can exert better control on\nimprovement by appropriately weighing reduction in the congestion versus\nimprovement costs. The challenge, however, lies in selecting an\nappropriate penalty function. A nonlinear penalty function is found\nsuitable for the test network studied. The second formulation does not\nrequire penalty function but results in a large number of scenarios.\nNonanticipativity constraints are introduced in the second formulation\nto arrive at uniform improvement over all scenarios. Both formulations\nare solved on a test network. It is found that necessary improvements\nand the total costs with both models are more than those for average\ndemand.

AB  - Network design models allow to define an optimal network configuration by means of objective functions subject to a series of constraints. The starting data and/or the constraints of the problem can be affected by uncertainty. These uncertain values are better managed through the use of fuzzy values/constraints. In this paper we present a fuzzy non-linear programming to solve the equilibrium Network Design problem for urban areas. This problem is formulated as a fixed point optimization subject to fuzzy constraints. The proposed method has been applied to a test network. The obtained results show that the proposed approach is very interesting. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fundamental to many transportation network studies, traffic flow models can be used to describe traffic dynamics determined by drivers' car-following, lane-changing, merging, and diverging behaviors. In this study, we develop a deterministic queueing model of network traffic flow, in which traffic on each link is considered as a queue. In the link queue model, the demand and supply of a queue are defined based on the link's fundamental diagram, and its in- and out-fluxes are computed from junction flux functions corresponding to macroscopic merging and diverging rules. We demonstrate that the model is well defined and discuss its relationships with existing link-based and kinematic wave models. With numerical simulations of traffic dynamics in a diverge-merge network, we discuss the the consistency between the link queue model and the kinematic wave model. As an addition to the multi-scale modeling framework of network traffic flow, the model strikes a balance between mathematical tractability and physical realism and can be used for analyzing traffic dynamics, developing traffic operation strategies, and studying drivers' route choice and other behaviors in large-scale road networks.

AB  - To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities, both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes, road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes, and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads due to different travel purposes, problems from using current non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes: comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km. The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research estables a three-tier NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift), NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms, benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network at the urban central area of Beijing is built up. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - We consider a dynamic traffic assignment model formulated as a nonlinear and noneonvex mathematical program. Necessary optimality conditions require equalization of certain marginal costs for all the paths that are being used, and these optimality conditions are shown to be a generalization of the optimality conditions of a conventional static traffic assignment problem. We also examine the behavior of the dynamic model under static demand conditions and show that in this case our model is a generalized version of a standard static model. Our model suggests a promising refinement of the objective function for the static case.

AB  - The word ‘ganyu’ is widely used in Malawi to describe a range of short-term rural labour relationships, the most common of which is piecework weeding or ridging on the fields of other smallholders, or on agricultural estates. Ganyu is a crucial poverty issue in Malawi because: • After own-farm production, ganyu is the most important source of livelihood for most poor households – for some it is becoming even more important than own-farm production. • Ganyu is the most important coping strategy for most poor households in the crucial hungry period between food stores running out and the next harvest. • The need to do ganyu to obtain an immediate supply of food may conflict with own-farm production and therefore, while addressing an immediate crisis, can lock some households into a vicious cycle of food insecurity. • Low ganyu wage rates mean agricultural labourers do not earn sufficient incomes to invest in sustainable livelihood development. Despite the widespread practice of ganyu, and its importance to the poor, it is an under-researched component of the jigsaw that makes up the livelihoods of rural Malawians. This is a mistake, as ganyu is too important to the poor to be sidelined – it will play a critical role in future rural development strategies and has important interactions with the current debate about developing safety nets in Malawi. The paper discusses recent literature on ganyu and opens up a debate about various future scenarios and how different strategies may affect rural labour markets.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are the major solutions to relieving traffic congestion. Traffic signal control and route guidance, two key subsystems of ITS, jointly influence traffic flow in time and space. Over the last three decades, combined traffic signal control and route guidance (CTSCRG) has been research emphasis. There are two kinds of model for describing CTSCRG: multiple user class traffic assignment model and discrete choice model. The intent of the paper is to compare the traffic equilibrium results of these two models. For describing route guidance system which is composed of guided driver and non-guided driver, the concept of multiple user class (MUC) is introduced. In MUC traffic assignment model, guided drivers are modeled as complete information user equilibrium traffic assignment, and non-guided drivers are modeled as stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment. In discrete choice model, guided drivers and non-guided drivers are modeled as stochastic dynamic user optimum and route choice model is logit model. The perception error of non-guided drivers is larger than the perception error of guided drivers. In this paper, perception error is the function of current travel time and sampled from uniform distribution. Because simulation-based method can allow more complex interactions and win in reality value than travel time formula, we combine Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with cellular automata simulation to calculate travel time and optimize signal setting plan. Iterative simulation and assignment procedure is built: road is discretized by cellular automata. Traffic flow dynamics is represented by cell transmission model; signal setting is optimized by hybrid genetic algorithm; vehicle agent can receive route guidance information and select suggested route. Comparison results show that MUC traffic assignment model converge, discrete choice model does not converge. Average delay of MUC traffic assignment model is lower than that of discrete-

(or time) between trip ends and zonal anchors. These can be specified by OD pair. Assuming that terminal costs and network costs are independent, the system assignment can be performed in two stages, respectively network and terminal. A probit model based on Clark?s formulas is recommended. A computation scheme is provided that loads OD flows by anchor pair onto the network in an efficient way. A binary case is addressed as illustration. Also reported is an application to the roadway network of the Paris area. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

AB  - In connection with the network realization problem the main questions of the algorithm are which edges to choose and what is the budget consequence of that. These problems can be solved by exact optimization methods, but in this case the number of computational steps (additions and comparisons) is an exponential function of the number of nodes. For this reason usually heuristic methods are chosen for solving these problems. Some special problems can be formulated as maximal flow problems. To get the solution we use only maximal flow and shortest route algorithms. Thus we decrease the number of computations, but the size of the network will grow. In this paper, we describe this algorithm to solve the network realization problem. Then we give a transportation network realization problem and show how to solve this problem by the some algorithms.

AB  - Traffic metering at on-ramps in interstate highways has been widely used and led to desirable results. In urban transportation networks when demand reaches network capacity level, traffic metering may also increase network performance efficiency. In this paper, we apply different metering strategies to a case study network to see if they result in a different network operation and potentially a more efficient performance. To make sure if any observed differences in network performance efficiency is due to metering strategies and not due to an inappropriate signal timing, we determine near optimal signal timing of the network by using our Intelligent Dynamic Signal Timing Optimization Program (IDSTOP). IDSTOP incorporates Genetic Algorithms (GAs) with microscopic traffic simulation to find near-optimal signal timing parameters of the network. Our results showed that letting all traffic enter the network or metering a large portion of the traffic are not the best options. Instead metering around 20% of the traffic resulted in the best network performance in terms of average delay (16% reduction compared to no metering and 17% reduction compared to extremely heavy metering strategies), network throughput (18% increase compared to heavy metering), and average travel time (14% reduction compared to no metering and 10% reduction compared to heavy metering). Our findings suggested that in an urban network, there is an optimal point that sending more vehicles into the network than that deteriorates network performance efficiency.

In the model, drivers are divided into several classes according to their knowledge about network traffic conditions. Travel-decision characteristics are the same within each class, but differ among classes. Some new concepts, such as OD perceived cost and familiar level with the traffic condition, are introduced. The equilibrium condition is formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. A numerical example shows that the proposed model can obtain more reasonable results than the other existing models. © ASCE.

From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - In many applications, the network design problem faces significant uncertainty in transportation costs and demand, as it can be difficult to estimate current (and future values) of these quantities. In this paper we present a robust optimiza- tion based formulation for the network design problem under transportation cost and demand uncertainty. We show that solving an approximation to this robust formulation of the network design problem can be done efficiently for a network with single origin and destination per commodity and general uncertainty in trans- portation costs and demand that are independent of each other. For a network with path constraints, we propose an efficient column generation procedure to solve the linear programming relaxation. We also present computational results that show that the approximate robust solution found provides significant savings in the worst case while incurring only minor sub-optimality for specific instances of the uncertainty.

AB  - The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - Incident-induced traffic congestion is a critical issue in formulation urban traffic congestion problems. This paper presents a method which serves to alleviate incident-induced traffic congestion for urban traffic network. The proposed approach includes two major parts: models and optimal control algorithm. Based on the typical phase types in Chinese cities, calculation models for controlled flow at intersection exit lanes, for movement offsets, for delay and queue of each movement, and for delay and queue of links adjacent to incident location were formulated respectively. Movement was the basic unit when delay and queue were calculated. Then a real-code genetic algorithm was presented to implement the optimal control under incident condition, in which we used a penalty function to ensure constraints. In the preliminary test, eight optimization strategies were chosen for the network control. The result showed that the total delay could decrease approximately 20% even if no vehicle diversion was considered under incident condition.

AB  - The paper investigates a model predictive control (MPC) strategy specialized in urban traffic management in order to relieve traffic congestion, reduce travel time and improve homogenous traffic flow. Over the theory the realization of the control method is also presented. To validate the effectiveness of the controller a busy traffic network was chosen for test field. The MPC strategy was implemented into the test network control system (hardware in loop simulation). The applied environment is a microscopic traffic simulator with mathematical software and proper computational applications for the evaluation. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the designed MPC based traffic control strategy. The system is able to improve the network efficiency and reduce travel time, creating optimal flow in the network subjected to control input constraints.

AB  - This paper investigated the problem of deriving token bucket
parameters from the observed traffic patterns of computer network flows
in two cases. In the basic case, we identified the set of token bucket
parameters for any given flow so that all the packets in the flow will
be delivered immediately without incurring any delay or loss. Then, we
extended the basic case by adding a queue to the token bucket model to
temporarily store packets that cannot be delivered right away until
enough tokens get accumulated in the bucket. The queue has the effect of
smoothing the traffic so that the resulting token bucket parameters are
less demanding. It also makes the derived token bucket parameters less
fluctuated over time. Relationship among the queue size and token bucket
parameters for a given flow are analyzed rigorously. Queuing delay for
each packet in the flow is calculated and used to describe the adjusted
post-queuing traffic pattern. Simple and efficient algorithms for the
derivation of measurement-based traffic specification (MBTS) are
presented, along with empirical results. This MBTS technology alleviates
the need for users to explicitly characterize the traffic a priori in
order to reserve network resource in an integrated services

AB  - This article addresses the "link-addition" or discrete network design problem in road travel. Given an existing urban road network, with projected increases in demands for road travel between various pairs of nodes, it is typically the case that severe congestion will exist if the capacity of the network is not expanded. Thus, the decision maker must consider building new links into the network, or increasing the capacity of some existing links. He must consider the various types of possible improvements to the network, as well as several locations in the network as candidates for improvement. When using a network to model a road transportation system, the travel time experienced by each driver along any link is given by the average travel time function for the link. Because of congestion, it is taken to be a nonlinear function of the total flow along the link. The sum of all drivers' travel times along a link is called the total travel time function. This is of considerable importance in solving large network design problems, since shortest route problems can be easily solved even for very large networks.

AB  - The traditional role of traffic engineering is to ensure that a telecommunications network has just enough capacity to meet expected demand with adequate quality of service. A critical requirement is to understand the three-way relationship between demand, capacity, and performance, each of these being quantified in appropriate units. The degree to which this is possible in a future multiservice network remains uncertain, due notably to the inherent self-similarity of traffic and the modeling difficulty that this implies. The purpose of the present chapter is to argue that sound traffic engineering remains the crucial element in providing quality of service and that the network must be designed to circumvent the self-similarity problem by applying traffic controls at an appropriate level. We discuss the nature of traffic in a multiservice network, identifying broad categories of flows with distinct quality of service requirements. Open-loop and closed-loop control options are discussed. It is demonstrated notably that self-similar traffic does not necessarily lead to poor network performance if adapted flow level controls are implemented. A tentative service model drawing on the lessons of the preceding discussion is proposed. Finally, we suggest how traditional approaches might be generalized to enable traffic engineering for a network based on this service model.

AB  - The operation of urban traffic network remains a challenge in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) due to the intrinsic complexity of traffic systems. In this paper, for the sake of improving the network efficiency, we present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for urban traffic network based on hybrid systems, which formulates split control as an MPC problem. Theoretical results ensure convergence of iterations to a globally optimal solution. The framework is applied to the signaling split control of traffic network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a comparative study on the ZhongGuanCun west region, Beijing was conducted using traffic simulation software. Findings indicate that the proposed control strategy is more efficient to reduce delay time and relieve traffic congestion of the whole traffic network when compared to the conventional fixed time control.

AB  - Increasing urban and suburban traffic congestion has motivated interest in Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) aimed at improving the performance of transportation networks and quality of travel. The ongoing development of advanced route guidance systems is providing new opportunities to improve traffic conditions and to reduce both recurrent and non-recurrent congestion in these networks. In such a dynamic route guidance system, a central controller could be informed of trip makers' origins, destinations and departure times. The controller could use this information to develop a coordinated strategy to assign each vehicle to a route to its destination, on a real time basis, to achieve either user-optimal or system-optimal objectives. This research aims to present a new generation of dynamic network equilibrium models, incorporating travel choice problems, including traveler's mode choice, departure/arrival time choice and route choice. These models are expected to be able to function as off-line dynamic travel forecasting and evaluation tools, and eventually as real-time on-line models of urban transportation networks. In ATIS systems, there are two kinds of information available to travelers: current and future travel time information.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

heavily on the use of faster than real time traffic simulation methods.
Although many micro-simulation traffic models have already been

trade off some of the fidelity of the results for significant gains in
computation time. This paper presents a new dynamic traffic assignment

AB  - Full article: Geneva, Switzerland, 26th July 2012—Statisticians from the University of Reading in partnership with TRAFFIC are helping in the global fight against the trade of illegal ivory, with a major revision of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), a global monitoring system for tracking illegal ivory trade.  With elephant poaching levels the worst they have been in a decade, and recorded ivory seizures at their highest levels since 1989, the revised system will give accurate and up-to-date information on the illegal trade of ivory. This will be of huge benefit for international and national policy makers on elephant conservation and on illicit trade who have previously struggled to get reliable and timely data.  At the heart of the upgrade is an innovative new database that allows countries to report seizures of illegal ivory online, making data entry easier and more accurate than ever before.  It will also encourage more countries to report illegal ivory trade as they will be able to access statistical summaries of their data and review other seizures where their country is implicated.  TRAFFIC manages ETIS on behalf of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is one of two elephant monitoring systems under CITES, the other being the Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) system.  The revised online ETIS will be showcased today at the CITES Standing Committee currently taking place in Geneva. In attendance will be representatives from many of the CITES Parties who will use the revised system. They will witness the functionality and the effectiveness of the database by way of a demonstration, ahead of its launch in September 2012.  Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood, statisticians from the University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, have worked closely with TRAFFIC to develop the revised ETIS. Dr Underwood, project leader, said: "We are very pleased that we are able to provide a solid statistical foundation to ETIS to ensure that it provides high quality and timely information on the illegal ivory trade at a crucial time for elephants." Recording illegal ivory seizures is just one aspect of the revised monitoring system, which now has enhanced capability to provide indicators of hidden illegal activity.  Applied Statistics Research Fellow Bob Burn, who conceived the current project and has been involved with ETIS since its inception in 1997, said: "Not all illegal ivory transactions are discovered or officially reported.  The challenge in analysing seizures data is to adjust for this gap by accounting for factors such as law enforcement effort and corruption. Using cutting edge statistical methods the monitoring system can now begin to combat this problem."  The statistical analyses will provide information on how patterns of illegal trade are changing over time and will identify problem countries so that attention can be focused upon those countries most heavily implicated in illicit trade. This provides crucial evidence for CITES and individual governments in their decision making when it comes to elephant conservation. The work was carried out under a Darwin Initiative project, led by the University of Reading, funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  UK Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: "These magnificent creatures are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers, and if we don't act now they may not have a future. This database, funded by Defra's Darwin Initiative, will accurately record illegal ivory seizures so we get a real picture of what is happening on the ground. This information can be shared around the world to help stop the illegal trade in ivory and put poachers out of business."  TRAFFIC's Tom Milliken, who manges ETIS, added: "Since 1997, our long-term collaboration with Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood from the University of Reading has progressively scaled up the science behind ETIS and made it a ‘best practice', state-of-the-art monitoring tool for the global conservation community.  TRAFFIC, but also elephants, trumpet their appreciation to Bob and Fiona and the Darwin Initiative!"  The database was developed in collaboration with Solertium Corporation, USA.

AB  - This article shows how the evolution of multi-commodity traffic flows over complex networks can be predicted over time, based on a simple macroscopic computer representation of traffic flow that is consistent with the kinematic wave theory under all traffic conditions. The method does not use ad hoc procedures to treat special situations. After a brief review of the basic model for one link, the article describes how three-legged junctions can be modeled. It then introduces a numerical procedure for networks, assuming that a time-varying origin-destination (O-D) table is given and that the proportion of turns at every junction is known. These assumptions are reasonable for numerical analysis of disaster evacuation plans. The results are then extended to the case where, instead of the turning proportions, the best routes to each destination from every junction are known at all times. For technical reasons explained in the text, the procedure is more complicated in this case, requiring more computer memory and more time for execution. The effort is estimated to be about an order of magnitude greater than for the static traffic assignment problem on a network of the same size. The procedure is ideally suited for parallel computing. It is hoped that the results in the article will lead to more realistic models of freeway flow, disaster evacuations and dynamic traffic assignment for the evening commute

AB  - This paper surveys techniques for the recognition and treatment of self-similar network or internetwork traffic. Various researchers have reported traffic measurements that demonstrate considerable burstiness on a range of time scales with properties of self-similarity. Rapid technological development has widened the scope of network and Internet applications and, in turn, increased traffic volume. The exponential growth of the number of servers, as well as the number of users, causes Internet performance to be problematic as a result of the significant impact that long-range dependent traffic has on buffer requirements. Consequently, accurate and reliable measurement, analysis and control of Internet traffic are vital. The most significant techniques for performance evaluation include theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical study based on measurement. In this research, we discuss existing and recent developments in performance evaluation and control tools used in network traffic engineering.

AB  - Evaluation and operation of intelligent transportation system technologies in transportation networks give rise to methodological capabilities that require description of the dynamics of network traffic flows over time and space. Both descriptive and normative dynamic traffic assignment capabilities are required in this environment. Several dynamic network flow modeling problem formulations that arise in this context are discussed, and simulation-assignment procedures are described for these problems. A dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) system for advanced traffic network management is described. It is built around a traffic simulation-assignment modeling framework, which describes the evolution of traffic patterns in the network for given traffic loading under particular control measures and route guidance information supply strategies to individual motorists. The simulator is also embedded in an interactive search algorithm to determine optimal route guidance instructions to motorists. Numerical experiments with the model illustrate the relative effectiveness of different information supply strategies under different user behavior response rules.

AB  - Route guidance and information systems are developed and popularly applied to help travelers to make route decisions today. Such devices can present information or give recommendations, so they have influence on the travelers travel choice in the traffic network. In this sense, the influence of guidance system on travelers’ route choice should be considered when the scenario of traffic network design is developed. However, few of existing traffic network design problem model considers the effect, and this motivates us to develop a Continuous Network Design (CNDP) model under a traffic network with guidance system. This study is based on the research of Jahn et al. (2005) to develop a single level program for CNDP under the traffic network with guidance system. The guidance system give advices to travelers based on system optimal rules with user constrains. From the result of simulation, it can be inferred that if the tolerance factor φ is properly chosen in our CNDP model, travelers all can decrease their travel time after network design than that they experienced at user equilibrium before network enhancement. That is to say, every traveler can profit from our CNDP scenario for proper tolerance factor φ.

By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - In the conventional transportation network design problem, travel demand is assumed to be known exactly in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the travel demand forecast would be precisely materialized under uncertainty. This is because travel demand forecast is affected by many factors such as economic growth, land use pattern, socioeconomic characteristics, etc. All these factors cannot be measured accurately, but can only be roughly estimated. Another issue in many existing transportation network design problems considers only one objective or a composite objective with a priori weights. It may be more realistic to explicitly consider multiple objectives in the transportation network design problem. We incorporate both travel demand uncertainty and multiple objectives into the transportation network design problem. It is formulated as a stochastic bi-level programming problem (SBLPP) where the upper level represents the traffic manager and the lower level represents the road users. To solve this SBLPP, a simulation-based multiobjective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) is developed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of SMOGA

Each of the projects is currently using some form of a locally-managed marine area (LMMA) strategy. The meetings were designed to allow these different projects to share and discuss their experiences in using locally-managed marine areas. From these initial meetings, representatives of some of these projects have agreed to work together and form a collaborative 'learning network' so that they can systematically share their knowledge and experiences about how to use this strategy more effectively and improve their conservation impact.2 This network is called the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) Network.

AB  - This paper addresses an issue of short-term traffic flow prediction in urban traffic networks with traffic signals in intersections. An effective spatial prediction approach is proposed based on a macroscopic urban traffic network model. In contrast with other time series based or spatio-temporal correlation methods, this research focuses on the substantial mechanism of vehicles transmission on road segments and the spatial model of the entire urban network. Furthermore, this approach employs a simple speed-density model based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to obtain a more accurate vehicle travel time on the link. Finally, the microscopic traffic simulation software, CORSIM, is adopted to simulate the real urban traffic, and the proposed method is used to predict the traffic flows generated by CORSIM. The simulation results illustrate that our approach performs effective prediction timely in the rush hours, as well as the suddenly changed traffic states. 2012 IEEE.

Policies for promoting urban growth reduce the urban unemployment ratio in the short run, but, by contrast, raise the urban unemployment ratio in the long run.  Along with agglomeration economies and inter-sectoral externality, the urban unemployment ratio plays a key role in determining social welfare.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - This paper deals with the second order capacity reliability evaluation for transportation network considering travel demand uncertainty. The stochastic demand is assumed to follow a normal distribution with travellers' route choice behaviour following Probit Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE). With the stochastic demand, both mean and standard deviation of the demand can be scaled up by some multipliers. The second-order network capacity is, thus, evaluated from the maximum weighted sum of the both multipliers with a constraint that the equilibrated link flows corresponding the new demand are less than specified deterministic capacities. The paper applies the implicit programming method to solve the optimization problem using the sensitivity analysis approach to derive the derivative of the equilibrium path choice probability with respect to both demand multipliers. The proposed model is then applied to a test network and the trade-off level between the network capacity and the robustness is presented.

A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

AB  - Current network measurement systems are becoming highly sophisticated, producing huge amounts of convoluted measurement data and statistics. As a very common case, those networks implementing statistics reporting based on the NetFlow [15] technology can generate several GBs of data on a daily basis. In addition, these measurements are often very hard to interpret. In this chapter we describe a method that provides linguistic summaries of network traffic measurements as well as a procedure for finding hidden facts in the form of linguistic association rules. Thus, here we address an association rules mining problem. The method is suitable for summarization and analysis of network measurements at the flow level. As a first step, fuzzy linguistic summaries are applied to analyze and extract concise and human consistent summaries from NetFlow collections. Then, a procedure for mining hidden facts in network flow measurements in the form of fuzzy association rules is developed. The method is applied to a wide set of heterogeneous flow measurements, and is shown to be of practical application to network operation and traffic engineering [6, 5], where it can help solve a number of current issues.
