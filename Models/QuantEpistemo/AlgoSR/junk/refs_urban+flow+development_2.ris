AB  - Selective non-catalytic redn. (SNCR) using urea soln. injection was applied to a HG-410/9.8-YW15 boiler on the base of conventional pulverized-coal reburning process.  Expts. were mainly conducted under 280, 345 and 410 t/h.  Results showed that NOx emission was below 200 mg/m3 (std. condition, 6% O2 vol. fraction, dry gas) when SNCR was operating, namely a NOx redn. of 40%-60%.  It was favorable to inject urea soln. using the injection layer where the hearth temp. was about 950 DegC, higher or lower might be disadvantageous to NOx redn. and the lower temp. also resulted in more ammonia slip.  The increase of layer's injection vol. flow rate could improve NOx redn. efficiency, the economical injection vol. flow rate in the exptl. range was 1.0-1.6m3.h-1 and the larger injection vol. flow rate also led to lower emission of NH3 and N2O.  But the water injected into the hearth resulted in a decrease of boiler efficiency by almost 0.5%. [on SciFinder (R)]

AB  - Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is carried out to investigate the velocity shear flow over rectangular cylinders with different side ratios of B/. D= 1, 5 and 8 (B: breadth of the cylinder, D: depth of the cylinder). The shear rate is expressed by a dimensionless shear parameter, defined by the oncoming velocity gradient, the cylinder thickness and the upstream velocity at the center plane of the cylinder. The Reynolds number based on the cylinder depth and the upstream velocity at the center plane of the cylinder is 22,000. Particular attention is devoted to variations with side ratio of shear flow and aerodynamic forces acting on the rectangular cylinders. It is shown that the side-ratio-dependent Strouhal number remains almost unchanged with shear parameter. The shear flow patterns around the rectangular cylinders vary with side ratio, resulting in a side-ratio-dependent aerodynamic force. An interesting finding is that the lift forces on the rectangular cylinders with B/. D= 5 and 8 act from the high-velocity side to the low-velocity side, while for B/. D= 1 they act from the low-velocity side to the high-velocity side. The stagnation point moves to the high-velocity side almost linearly with shear parameter for all investigated side ratios, implying that the movement of stagnation point to the high-velocity side is an inherent behavior in shear flow. In addition, the unsteady flow structures and the mechanism for the change of aerodynamic force with side ratio in shear flows are investigated. Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper introduces an asset-focused framework whose objective is both analytically to better understand, and operationally to more appropriately address, the different phases of urban climate change (CC) as it impacts on poor urban communities. After an overview of current CC adaptation approaches, it describes the two asset adaptation framework components; first, an asset vulnerability analytical framework that appraises the vulnerability groups most affected by CC-related disasters, and second, an asset adaptation operational framework that identifies CC strategies at individual, household and community level in four phases of long-term resilience; pre-disaster damage limitation; immediate post-disaster response; and rebuilding. It concludes by describing its associated methodology. The paper aims to assist CC researchers and those supporting the poor protect and rebuild assets during CC-related disaster processes.

AB  - This paper describes the continuation of an investigation into the effects of increased flow on the dissolved oxygen concentration in the River Maun, UK. A previous investigation indicated that an oxygen demand additional to that in the water phase is observed during and directly after intermittent discharges. Simplified modelling of the river indicated that the additional oxygen demand was possibly linked to the disturbance of sediment during such events. A device has been developed which can be used in situ to measure the effect of flow velocity (shear stress) on the additional demand. Preliminary tests have shown that the inferred demand is significant. It is proposed that the in situ device now be used to measure the oxygen demand of the bed material at a number of locations and flow speeds and that a relationship between the additional demand and velocity be established, with the aim of incorporating such a relationship into a simplified model.

AB  - The symptoms following sinus and vein occlusion observed in patients and experimental animals display a considerable variability that so far remains largely unexplained. In a rat cortical vein occlusion model using a photochemical thrombotic technique, we examined changes in the cerebral venous flow pattern by fluorescence angiography and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral blood volume fraction (CBVF) by a modern laser Doppler "scanning" technique. Brain damage was assessed histologically. Fluorescence angiographic findings fell into two groups: group A, rats with an altered venous flow pattern after occlusion (n = 12), and group B, rats with interruption of blood flow and/or a growing venous thrombus (n = 5). In addition, sham-operated animals made up group C (n = 5). Extravasation of fluorescein, a massive decrease in rCBF, a short-lasting increase in CBVF, and regional brain damage were typical for group B. In addition, cortical CBF mapping revealed a transient hyperperfusion zone with hyperemia surrounding a hypoperfused ischemic core in group B. A circulation perturbation following venous occlusion appeared near those occluded cerebral veins without sufficient collateral flow. Furthermore, the venous thrombus continued to grow, accompanied by local critical ischemia and severe brain damage. Conversely, 71% of the animals (12 of 17) tolerated occlusion of a solitary vein without major flow disturbances or histological evidence of damage to the CNS (group A).

AB  - Urban flow is a phenomenon of the interaction and relation between the\ncities in the region based on the transport network and urban synthetic\nstrength. And, because of the difference in traffic conditions and the\nlevel of economic development in different city, the intensity of the\nurban flow of each city is different and the primary effecting factor is\ndissimilar. The traditional analysis on the effecting factors of urban\nflow concerns the background of the entire region as a whole entity,\nwhich would be too vague and ignore the difference in the effecting\nfactors of different cities as well as the micro differences and spatial\nnon-stationarity in the dominant factor. The research on spatial\ndifference in the effecting factors of the urban flow in this paper\nfocused on the analysis of the diverse effecting factors of urban now\ncaused by the regional disparity; found out the primary factors; and\nanalyzed the spatial characteristics of effecting factors using GIS.

AB  - The hydrodynamic development of non-Newtonian fluid flow in the entrance region of a tube with a porous wall is examined numerically by solving the modified Navier-Stokes equations. Cases involving blowing, suction, and no mass transfer through the walls are considered. Velocity distributions, pressure drops, and skin-friction coefficients are presented for each case. A definite concavity is found in the velocity profile near the tube entrance for all cases. Results for Newtonian fluids are compared with previous studies in which boundary-layer theory was used. In the region away from the entrance, it is found that the present results are in good agreement with previous works. In the region close to the entrance, or in the case of suction, boundary-layer theory is shown to be inappropriate.

AB  - A computational investigation was conducted on rarefied hypersonic flow past truncated wedges at incidence. Positive angle-of-attack effects on the aerodynamic surface quantities have been investigated by employing the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method. The results presented highlight the sensitivity of the heat transfer coeffcient, the total drag coeffcient, and the total lift coeffcient to changes not only on the angle of attack but also on the frontal-face thickness of the leading edges. Some significant differences between sharp and blunt leading edges were noted on the surface quantities. Interesting features observed in these surface properties showed that even small leading edge thickness, compared to the freestream mean free path, still has important effects on high Mach number leading edge flows. The analysis is of great importance since it is mpossible to achieve ideally sharp leading edges of airframes, such as waveriders.

AB  - Experimental investigation has been made on the flow and thermal fields\nover a heated two-dimensional hill with a cosine-squared shape. The\ndetailed turbulent characteristics are measured by a backscatter-type\ntwo-component LDV, a PIV system, a fine thermocouple and a cold-wire\nprobe. In the reverse-flow region on the leeward side of the hill, the\nturbulence intensities and the Reynolds shear stress show much larger\nvalues than in a canonical wall-bounded shear flow. The mean\ntemperature maintains a relatively high value below the location where\nthe horizontal mean velocity rapidly decreases. At the outer edge of\nthe reverse-flow region, there exists a second maximum intensity of\ntemperature fluctuations. The instantaneous temperature waveforms near\nthe heated surface show very large amplitude consisting of\nhigh-frequency fluctuations superimposed on the low-frequency motions.\nSimultaneous measurement of velocity and temperature is also done using\na combination of a two-component LDV and a fine-wire thermocouple\ntogether with digital response compensation. In the downstream region\nof the hill, the horizontal and vertical turbulent heat fluxes become\nmaximum at the hill-top height, and tend to diffuse in the vertical\ndirection. On the other hand, in the reverse-flow region formed behind\nthe hill, both of the heat fluxes decrease remarkably. In particular,\nit is worth noting that the horizontal turbulent heat flux near the\nsurface becomes opposite in sign to that in the forward flow region.\nThis is mainly due to the reversal of the mean flow direction.

AB  - Landslides are one of the most important processes supplying debris flow materials into channels. We need to predict the timing, location, and volume of landslides for better estimation of the occurrence of debris flows. However, a number of soil parameters (e.g., the angle of internal friction, cohesion, and porosity), which have significant spatial variability, are needed to predict landslide occurrence. Therefore, it is important to make clear the contribution of these parameters to overall slope stability and their relationships to one another. In this study, we normalized the safety factor equation for infinite slope model, and introduced multi soil layer structure into the model. We also tried to clarify factors affecting the pore water pressure on the basis of the equations for the vertical infiltration process (i.e., continuity equation and Darcy's law). Depth gradient of the pore-water pressure at the given soil layer is controlled by the ratio of the water velocity in saturated zone to the hydraulic conductivity at that layer. New, non-dimensional representations for the effects of groundwater table and cohesion of soil were obtained by the normalization of the safety factor equation. They are evaluated relative to each other by comparison to the stability of dry non-cohesive soil. The effect of the groundwater table and the cohesion of soil on the slope stability are both affected by depth of the sliding surface. We also found that the effect of cohesion should be evaluated from the comparison with the maximum effect of groundwater table to the stability. This can explain the immunity of post-landslide slopes to immediately subsequent landslides, as well as the cyclical nature of landslide processes. Â© 2011 Casa Editrice UniversitÃ  La Sapienza.

AB  - The presented study examines various methods for phase-averaging the naturally os- cillating flow field of an enlarged fluidic oscillator acquired by a high-speed PIV system. Because of the absence of an external trigger, phase-averaging the acquired data is chal- lenging. Mathematical and physical methods are categorized and described. The results of these methods are evaluated for their accuracy in capturing the natural flow field. It is found that the mathematical methods, especially the method of proper orthogonal de- composition, produce reasonable qualitative results. However, compared to the physical methods, shortcomings in quantitative accuracy are revealed. The physical methods require a time-resolved reference signal. Two possibilities to identify the oscillation periods in the reference signal are described and compared. It is found that applying an autocorrelation on the reference signal improves the period identification due to consideration of a locally fluctuating mean value. This period identification method and according phase-averaging yields the best results regarding the minimum fluctuation of the oscillation period lengths. The according procedure is described in detail and applied to the internal and external flow field of the fluidic oscillator.

AB  - Numerical simulations were conducted to model the transient flow development in a naturally ventilated space containing a centrally located localized source of heat. The simulations were compared with a series of small-scale laboratory experiments and existing theoretical models. The aim of the work was to benchmark CFD models for time-dependent buoyancy-driven natural ventilation against previously published experimental results and theoretical models. The simulations agree well with experimental\nresults during the initial development of the room stratification. The CFD results accurately predict the\nmaximum depth of the hot buoyant layer at the top of the room as well as the steady-state interface height which separates the warm upper buoyant layer from the cooler air below. The simulations also predict well the time taken for the buoyant upper layer to reach its maximum depth. However, at longer times the results diverge. This may be due to thermal diffusion and mixing at the interface between the upper and lower layers due to the inflow from the floor level vents.

AB  - This paper presents the experimental investigation of a scaled down model of a PGT10 gas turbine diffuser by Nuovo Pignone S.p.A. The model was designed to operate in geometric and Reynolds number similarity with the GT diffuser, and 24 guide vanes are mounted at inlet to reproduce typical inlet conditions of an industrial gas turbine diffuser. The PGT10 diffuser has also six high-solidity struts, which support one of the shaft bearings and have lubricating oil supply inside. Two step-motors are used for the circumferential and radial displacement of the probes. Airflow through the test model is provided by an open circuit wind tunnel, which is powered by a 21 kW centrifugal fan. Two hot split-film probes in constant temperature mode were used to measure velocity fluctuations in main-flow, cross-flow and radial-flow directions, thus allowing a 3D characterization of the model's flow field. Results are presented in terms of mean and fluctuating velocity components at different axial positions. The discussion is focused on the distortion of the flow produced by the struts and on the separation around the hub and the shell. A first set of measurement defines the flow field from the inlet to the exhaust at four axial sections. In three additional axial positions, behind the struts, a more detailed analysis has been made with measuring grid with a double number of nodes. The investigation of the flow field inside the diffuser is also presented by means of the turbulent scale of dissipating eddies, calculated with the Kolmogorov theory. The Kolmogorov length scale seems to be a powerful means to study fluid dynamic phenomena. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, laser-Doppler anemometry measurement of steady flow development in a model human aorta has been reported. Studies were made with uniform entry flow at the root of the aorta and our measurements showed the establishment of a pair of Dean vortices in the mid-arch region. Subsequently, the nature of flow development past centrally occluding caged ball valves in the model aorta was investigated. Our studies showed that in the ascending aorta, an asymmetric velocity profile is obtained with larger velocity gradients towards the inner wall of tertiary curvature (anatomically the left lateral wall) with centrally occluding valves. The peripheral flow past these valves prevented the development of Dean vortices in the mid-arch region. The caged ball valves at the root of the aorta had no discernible effect on the velocity profiles in the brachio-cephalic artery.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The umbilical vein is the major source of blood for the fetal liver, but portal blood, which has not been measured directly in human fetuses, probably constitutes a physiologically important contribution. We aimed to establish a method for measuring blood flow in the fetal portal vein and to produce longitudinal reference ranges for diameter, blood flow velocities and volume blood flow during the second half of pregnancy. METHODS: After a pilot project to develop the measuring technique, 160 low-risk pregnant women were recruited to a longitudinal study that included ultrasound examinations at 4-5-week intervals starting at 20-22 weeks of gestation. The inner diameter (D) of the vessel was measured with a perpendicular insonation angle, and the time-averaged maximum blood velocity (TAMXV) and weighted mean velocity (VWMEAN) were recorded with an insonation directed along the long axis of the vessel. Portal flow was calculated as: Q = pi(D/2)(2) x h x TAMXV (where h is a velocity profile parameter and equals 0.5). Portal flow was normalized for estimated fetal weight based on birth-weight percentiles. RESULTS: The portal vein could be visualized and measured in 558/593 (94%) cases. Blood flow was pulsatile. D and TAMXV doubled during the second half of pregnancy (21-39 weeks), from 1.5 to 3.4 mm and from 8.4 to 14.9 cm/s, respectively. Correspondingly, the portal flow increased from 5 to 41 mL/min, and from 10 to 13 mL/min/kg when normalized for fetal weight. Similar results were achieved for VWMEAN. CONCLUSION: Portal flow can be measured with a standardized technique. It increases during the second half of pregnancy, even when normalized for fetal weight, suggesting that it has increasing importance in the fetal liver circulation.

The quantitative and qualitative changes of the non-inherent nature of material flow determine the development states of material flow, which mainly manifest three states, namely, traditional material flow, modern material flow and transform of the traditional material flow to modern material flow. To further reveal the change rule of material flow development states, this paper takes establishment of three-dimensional structure model of material flow state as the theoretic foundation, express it with the ordered triple M <sub>F</sub>=SMTE, C, V(t). It reflects the material flow state changes with non-inherent nature SMTE about V(t) of C.

AB  - Computations of turbulent trailing-edge flow have been carried out at a Reynolds number of 1000 (based on the free-stream quantities and the trailing-edge thickness) using an unsteady 3D Reynolds-Averaged NavierâStokes (URANS) code, in which two-equation (kâÎµ) turbulence models with various low-Re near wall treatments were implemented. Results from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the same flow are available for comparison and assessment of the turbulence models used in the URANS code. Two-dimensional URANS calculations are carried out with turbulence mean properties from the DNS used at the inlet; the inflow boundary-layer thickness is 6.42 times the trailing-edge thickness, close to typical turbine blade flow applications. Many of the key flow features observed in DNS are also predicted by the modelling; the flow oscillates in a similar way to that found in bluff-body flow with a von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex street produced downstream. The recirculation bubble predicted by unsteady RANS has a similar shape to DNS, but with a length only half that of the DNS. It is found that the unsteadiness plays an important role in the near wake, comparable to the modelled turbulence, but that far downstream the modelled turbulence dominates. A spectral analysis applied to the force coefficient in the wall normal direction shows that a Strouhal number based on the trailing-edge thickness is 0.23, approximately twice that observed in DNS. To assess the modelling approximations, an a priori analysis has been applied using DNS data for the key individual terms in the turbulence model equations. A possible refinement to account for pressure transport is discussed.

Two aspects of this simulation in\nparticular are discussed here, the resolution and the inlet boundary\nconditions. In contrast to the LES of flows with sharp edge separations\nwhich do not require the near-wall dynamics to be fully resolved, the\nhill flow LES relies on the resolution of the upstream boundary layer\nin order to provoke the separation at a correct position. Although\naround 15 x 10(6) computational cells were used, the resolution of\nstreaky structures in the near-wall region that are important for a LES\nis not achieved. Two different inlet boundary conditions were used: the\nsteady experimental profile and the time-dependent boundary conditions\nproduced from DNS results of low Reynolds number channel flow. No\nsignificant improvement in the results was obtained with the unsteady\ninlet condition. This indicates that, although the unsteady inlet\nboundary conditions may be necessary for a successful LES of this flow,\nthey must be followed with the resolution of the boundary layer for a\nsuccessful LES.

AB  - Two separate mechanisms can be responsible for natural convection flow between the hot and cold zones of a multizone enclosure: (1) bulk density differences created by temperature differences between the fluid in the hot and cold zones (bulk-density-driven flow) and, (2) thermosyphon âpumpingâ generated by boundary layers or plumes (motion-pressure-driven flow). This paper reports the results of an experimental study that examines the transition between flow regimes, as a function of aperture size, in a two-zone enclosure with heated and cooled end walls. A constant heat flux boundary condition was maintained on one vertical end wall, and an isothermal cold temperature sink was maintained on the opposite vertical end wall. All of the remaining surfaces were highly insulated. The transition between the boundary-layer-driven regime and the bulk-density-driven regime was established as a function of the geometry of the aperture in a partition that separated the hot and cold zones. The results of the study demonstrate that transition from the boundary-layer-driven regime to the bulk-density-driven regime is caused by blockage of the boundary layer flow when the area of the flow aperture is reduced below a critical value. A preliminary model has been developed which predicts that the critical aperture area for the onset of flow blockage is directly proportional to the number of active heat transfer surfaces and inversely proportional to the Rayleigh number which characterizes the level of heating and cooling provided to the active heat transfer surfaces.

In this paper, a novel spatial filtering method based on an electrostatic sensor matrix (ESM) is proposed for local particle mean velocity measurement in a gas-solid two-phase pipe flow. The sensing zone of each linear sensor array in the ESM is analyzed using a finite element method. The relationship between the frequency spectrum characteristics of the output signals of the ESM and local particle mean velocity is obtained. A local particle mean velocimeter based on the ESM is further designed and established. Performance of the velocimeter is evaluated on a gravity-fed particle flow rig. Experimental results demonstrate that the standard deviation of the measured velocities by the velocimeter is less than 11.1%. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A Galerkin finite element method is described for studying the stability of two superposed immiscible Newtonian fluids in plane Poiseuille flow. The formulation results in an algebraic eigenvalue problem of the form A L^2 + B L+ C = 0 which, after transforming to a standard generalized eigenvalue problem, is solved by the QR algorithm. The numerical results are in good agreement with previous asymptotic results. Additional results show that the finite element method is ideally suited for studying linear stability of superposed fluids when parameters characterizing the flow fall outside the range amenable to perturbation methods. The applicability of the finite element method to similar eigenvalue problems is demonstrated by analysing the steady-state spatial development of two superposed fluids in a channel.

AB  - The near-field region of a coaxial jet having inner to outer diameter ratio di /do 0.39 is investigated experimentally for four ratios of annular to central jet velocities of   0.18, 0.48, 0.8, and 1.11. Measurements were acquired nonintrusively using molecular tagging velocimetry at downstream distances up to six inner jet diameters. High spatial-resolution profiles of mean axial velocity, axial turbulent intensity, skewness, kurtosis, radial gradients of mean velocity, and velocity gradient fluctuations are presented and discussed. In the near-exit region of the inner mixing layer, evidence suggests the existence of two trains of vortices shed from the inner jet wall for velocity ratios   0.18. The results also indicate that for the flow configuration examined the length of the annular potential core is a function of the velocity ratio. Turbulence characteristics of the flow appear to be influenced by both the velocity ratio and absolute velocity of the annular jet. Integral length and Taylor microscales in the inner shear layer are shown to grow monotonically with downstream distance, with their ratio reaching a constant value. It is concluded that the turbulence structure in the inner mixing layer is highly anisotropic and that the levels of anisotropy are a relatively strong function of the velocity ratio.

AB  - The flow around a trailing edge is computed with a new hybrid method\ndesigned to more clearly separate the effects of total and sub-grid\nturbulent stress-modelling on the time-averaged and instantaneous\nvelocity fields, and in turn, mean momentum and kinetic energy balances.\nThese two velocity fields independently define Reynolds averaged\nand sub-grid-scale viscosities, and distinct stresses, at the same\nlocation.

AB  - The flow around a low-pressure turbine rotor blade with incoming periodic wakes is computed by means of DNS and LES. The latter adopts a dynamic sub-grid-scale model. The computed results are compared with time-averaged and instantaneous measured quantities. The simulation sreveal the presence of elongated flow structures, stemming from the incoming wake vorticity, which interact with the pressure side boundary layer. As the wake approaches the upstream half of the suction side, its vortical structures are stretched and align with the main flow, resulting in an impingement at virtually zero angle of attack. Periodically, in the absence of impinging wakes, the laminar suction side boundary layer separates in the adverse pressure gradient region. Flow in the laminar separation bubble is found to undergo transition via a KelvinHelmholtz instability. Subsequent impingement of the wake inhibits separation and thus promotes boundary layer reattachment. LES provides a fair reproduction of the DNS results both in terms of instantaneous, phase-averaged, and time-averaged flow fields with a considerable reduction in computational effort.

AB  - The deformation dynamics of a compound liquid droplet in shear flow is numerically investigated in two- and three-dimensional space. The computational model is based on the immersed boundary method. This accurately and efficiently tracks the interfaces of immiscible multi-phase fluids. We extend a recently developed volume-conserving immersed boundary method for two-phase fluid flow to ternary compound droplet flows. For long time simulations, we also apply a surface remeshing algorithm. Chorin's projection method is employed, and the resulting system of discrete equations is solved by a multigrid technique. We study the effects of radius, interfacial tension ratios, and inner droplet location on the deformation of a compound droplet, and compute the inclination angles of inner and outer droplets. Simulation results indicate that the angle of the inner droplet is always greater than or equal to that of the outer one. The effect of wall confinement on compound droplet deformation is compared with that of a simple droplet. The result shows that the more confined the wall is, the more different the compound and simple droplets' behavior. Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Presented herein are the studies of the flow behaviour of blood in the entrance region of a segment of an artery. The artery has an axisymmetric mild stenosis developed right from the entry cross section. The blood has been represented by a Bhingham fluid model which also takes the core region, formed due to axial migration of the red blood cells, into account. The flow in the artery has been divided into two regions developing boundary layer and a central core region. A fourth degree velocity profile satisfying the boundary conditions at the wall and the matching conditions at the core and the boundary layer interface is introduced in the governing momentum integral equation. The indicated integration provides a relation for the boundary layer thickness for each axial position. The results for the pressure distribution, entrance length and the wall shear stresses are discussed for the various values of the parameters involved in the analysis. The analysis predicts that the entrance length increases as the stenosis grows and therefore the heart has to put in more energy into transporting blood. It seems that there is some inbuilt mechanism which keeps the entry region of every segment to a minimum in normal arteries at each junction. This length increases in pathological states leading to various types of hypertensive diseases due to the formation and growth of the stenosis.

AB  - An experimental analysis using three-dimensional laser Doppler velocimetery (LDV) measurements and computational analysis using the Reynolds stress model of the commercial code, FLUENT, were conducted to give a clear understanding on the structure of the tip leakage flow in a forward-swept axial-flow fan operating at the peak efficiency condition, and to emphasize the necessity of using an anisotropic turbulence model for the accurate prediction of the tip leakage vortex. The rolling-up of the tip leakage flow was initiated near the position of the maximum static pressure difference, which was located at approximately 12% axial tip chord downstream from the leading edge of the blade, and developed along the centerline of the pressure trough on the casing. A reverse flow between the blade tip and the casing due to the tip leakage vortex acted as a blockage on the through-flow. As a result, high momentum flux was observed below the tip leakage vortex. As the tip leakage vortex proceeded to the aft part of the blade passage, the strength of the tip leakage vortex decreased due to the strong interaction with the through-flow and the casing boundary layer, and the diffusion of the tip leakage vortex by high turbulence. Through the comparative study of turbulence models, it was clearly shown that an anisotropic turbulence model, e.g., Reynolds stress model, should be used to predict reasonably an anisotropic nature of the turbulent flow fields inside the tip leakage vortex. In comparison with LDV measurement data, the computed results predicted the complex viscous flow patterns inside the tip region in a reliable level.

AB  - Motivated by the recent experimental observation of noticeable features of dimplelike surface roughness patterns onthe hybrid fuel grain, the authors investigated a coldflowin a porouschamberwith surface massinjection through a large eddy simulation technique. The main purpose is to understand the role of turbulent structures in generating those irregular, isolated roughness patterns found on the fuel surface. Itwas noted that the structural feature of near- wall coherent vortices has been considerably altered by the application of wall injection, resulting in isolated cell-like contours of streamwise velocity distributed all over the horizontal planes close to the wall. This sudden change of contour shape is reminiscent of the roughness patterns observed in the accompanying experiment. The rapid evolution of the kinematical configuration of near-wall turbulence structures is believed to be caused by the effect of vertical momentum given at the wall as in the regression process.

The experiments demonstrated the retardation of the onset of the development of the Marangoni concentration-induced convection relative to the moment of the contact between an inflowing surfactant (alcohol) and the surface. The critical concentration gradients (the Marangoni diffusion numbers) necessary for the initiation of mass transfer of a liquid along the interface were determined as dependent on the rate of inflow of a tongue of a more concentrated solution and the initial alcohol concentration around the bubble.

AB  - The lateral force on a tethered rigid sphere submerged in a turbulent, uniform shear flow of water was measured. Periodic and non-periodic motions of the sphere were observed depending on flowrate, shear and sphere density. The direction of the observed lateral force was opposite to that predicted by inviscid theory and increased in magnitude as the sphere's Reynolds numbers based on relative velocity, Re, and average shear, Re(nabla) increased. The lateral force was found to correlate with the product Re Re(nabla). The data suggests that a sign reversal occurs at relatively small values of the product Re Re(nabla), where the lateral force is dominated by inviscid effects. The results are explained assuming that the lateral forces on rigid spheres are a consequence of two competing factors: namely, inviscid lift forces and the vortex shedding-induced lateral forces which are dominant for higher Reynolds numbers. An estimate of the kinetic energy in the wake was used to show that the vortex shedding-induced lateral forces correlate with the product Re Re(nabla) and are in a direction opposite to the inviscid lift force. Combining the experimental data of this study with similar data a correlation for the lift coefficient of spheres in turbulent shear flows was developed. This correlation is applicable to turbulent multiphase flows having a spherical dispersed phase.

AB  - The paper reports on the turbulent flow structure and the distribution of the local surface heat transfer coefficient of a cube placed in a spatially periodic in-line matrix of cubes mounted on one of the walls of a plane channel. Infrared thermography was applied to measure the surface temperature at the cube walls, from which the distribution of the local heat transfer coefficient was determined. The velocity field and its structure were evaluated from Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) measurements and flow visualizations. The spatial periodicity was confirmed from flow field and heat transfer measurements across the entire matrix. The results showed that the flow has a marked vortex structure only in the immediate proximity of the cube, while the flow above the cube and in the streamwise corridors was only mildly distorted, except for a high level of turbulence intensity. Flow separation at the sharp leading top and side edges led to flow recirculations with subsequent flow reattachment at these faces. Reattachment of the top shear layer at the channel floor downstream of the cube produced a two-cell structure in the inter-obstacle space: an arc-type vortex in the wake of the upstream cube and a horseshoe-type vortex in front of the downstream cube. Flow instabilities caused vortex shedding at the side faces of the cube which led to periodic motions in its wake. The measured Strouhal number showed a constant value of St = 0.109 over the range of Reynolds numbers considered. The observed local flow structure, in particular flow separation and reattachment, caused marked variation in the distribution of the local heat transfer coefficient, with large gradients detected particularly at the top and side faces of the cube.

AB  - Urban transportation planning and land-use policies play a pivotal role in every society and are the subjects of interest in many academic fields. Creating a tool that measures the benefits and costs associated with the built environment, which includes the surrounding land-use and transportation system, would allow decision makers to choose the best option available to them when deciding on those important issues. In addition to travel time, congestion, safety, energy, and environment, public health is an important subject that can be affected by a transportation system. The primary objective of this study is to develop models for different health-related variables including general health, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, asthma, and heart attack. This is to investigate the role of transportation, land-use, and the built environment variables along with demographic and socioeconomic factors on people?ì² health. The results of the analysis showed that increasing the transit use and decreasing the autouse have a significant positive impact on all the health variables except for asthma. It was found that every percent decrease in autouse would reduce the chance of obesity by 0.4%, high blood pressure by 0.3%, high blood cholesterol by 1.3%, and heart attack by 1%. In addition to the transit-oriented development, making the environment more pedestrian friendly could motivate people to be more physically active in their daily routines and have a healthier lifestyle.

AB  - Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;A longitudinal vortical structure is typically observed in near-wall turbulence. This vortical structure is elongated in the streamwise direction, though it is also tilted in the spanwise direction. The sense of this spanwise tilting is determined by the sign of the streamwise vorticity associated with the vortex, and longitudinal vortical structures with a different streamwise vorticity become asymmetric (mirror symmetric). The tilting must be due to the combined effects of the non-linear terms and mean spanwise vorticity associated with the mean shear. However, the detailed mechanism of the tilting is not well known. To study the tilting in detail, we performed direct numerical simulations of a homogeneous shear flow where the longitudinal vortical structures similar to those in the near-wall region are observed. In particular, the effects of spanwise system rotation as well as the Reynolds number on the vortical structure are studied. As a result, we found that spanwise system rotation has more marked effects on the vortical structure than the Reynolds number. When the system rotation is imposed in the same direction as the mean spanwise vorticity, the tilting is enhanced, while the system rotation of the opposite direction attenuates it. We also found that when the longitudinal vortical structure is tilted in the spanwise direction, it is sandwiched between the streamwise vorticity of the opposite sign. The cyclonic rotation enhances the streamwise vorticity of the opposite sign, though the longitudinal vortical structure at the center is attenuated. In the anticyclonic case, the streamwise vorticity of the opposite sign almost disappears and the longitudinal vortical structure is isolated from the surrounding flow.

The wall pressure fluctuations and flow field velocity fluctuations were measured simultaneously by using a microphone and an X-type hotwire, respectively. The spatially and temporally strong coupling between the convecting flow structures and the wall pressure fluctuations were meticulously investigated in terms of the continuous wavelet transform, cross-correlation and coherence of the wall pressure and flow field. The characteristics of the large-scale vortical structures, e.g., the shedding frequency, averaged convection velocity, convective motion, and structure pattern were revealed.

AB  - The spatial development of the inlet velocity profile in a uniformly porous channel and tube is investigated. For tubes which are very long compared with their radius, it is shown that above a critical Reynolds number of 2.3 the inlet velocity profile does not necessarily decay into the fully developed, similarity profile for an infinite tube. Rather, the structure of the flow throughout the entire tube is influenced by the inlet profile. This loss of validity of the similarity solution is due to the fact that the tube is of finite length and the inlet profile is not of the similarity form. The actual length of the tube is, however, unimportant. Analogous results hold for the flow in a porous channel, with a critical Reynolds number of approximately 6.

AB  - Fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNSs) have been performed with a high-order spectral element method to study the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid in a smooth circular pipe of radius R and axial length 25R in the tur- bulent flow regime at four different friction Reynolds numbers ReÏ = 180, 360, 550 and 1,000. The new set of data is put into perspective with other simulation data sets, obtained in pipe, channel and boundary layer geometry. In particular, differences between different pipe DNS are highlighted. It turns out that the pressure is the vari- able which differs the most between pipes, channels and boundary layers, leading to significantly different mean and pressure fluctuations, potentially linked to a stronger wake region. In the buffer layer, the variation with Reynolds number of the inner peak of axial velocity fluctuation intensity is similar between channel and boundary layer flows, but lower for the pipe, while the inner peak of the pressure fluctuations show negligible differences between pipe and channel flows but is clearly lower than that for the boundary layer, which is the same behaviour as for the fluctuating wall shear stress. Finally, turbulent kinetic energy budgets are almost indistinguishable between the canonical flows close to the wall (up to y+ â 100), while substantial differences are observed in production and dissipation in the outer layer. A clear Reynolds number dependency is documented for the three flow configurations.

AB  - Flow field measurements behind pipe entrance inserts called as flow conditioners in a mean flow Reynolds number range 547â¤Reâ¤9000 are presented herein. A tube bundle, a Laws' perforated plate and an etoile were located at the entrance of a smooth circular pipe of inner diameter, D=26.6mm. The covered ranges of open area ratio, Î² and non-dimensional length, L/D were 0.49â¤Î²â¤0.74 and 0.123â¤L/Dâ¤2 respectively. The cross-sectional axial velocity u=u(r) profiles at the downstream stations of X/D=75,X/D=375,X/D=680 together with pressure losses Î´P are referred to determine the influence of utilized designs.The flow conditioners have a single performance characteristic expressed through a relationship of pressure loss coefficient K=K(ReÎ²) which provides a practical method for the calculation of time-averaged pressure loss, Î´PÌ in an average error margin of Â±18%. The laminar flow inside the pipe without an insert in the range of Re<2450 is not fully developed sensed with u=u(r) profiles having a Â±20% deviation from the Blasius profile for the lengths X/D<680. Meanwhile flow conditioners provide a fully developed laminar flow independent of Re and X observed in terms of downstream u=u(r) profiles with a better fit to the Blasius profile in a mean error margin of Â±10%.The laminar flow control via flow conditioners is analyzed through a discussion in terms of the introduced local non-dimensional velocity parameters. The used methodology is based on the definition of entrance length Reynolds Number; ReX=(X/D)Re. The proposed equations "ReXÎ²=C" (where C is a constant) can be used for the estimation of settling distance of the flow conditioners and laminar entrance length. The experimental data are in conformity with the magnitudes of C=2.87Ã104 and C=3Ã105 with the corresponding error margins of Â±4% and Â±6% respectively. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Developing entrance flows are of interest in a large number of application areas. They have been widely studied in the past, but many aspects of these flows are not yet fully understood. One of the questions concerns the stability and turbulent transition in the entrance region of a channel. The present study investigates by direct numerical simulation (DNS) the laminar-turbulent transition induced by boundary layer interaction in a spatially developing flow near the entrance of a channel, where the laminar flow is linearly stable. For uniform inlet flow conditions and at sufficiently high Reynolds number, the turbulent transition actually takes place inside the boundary layers and well before the fully developed regime. The transition of one of the two boundary layers is triggered near the entry section by small amplitude perturbations, such as the ones created by small isolated obstacles distributed on the wall. These generate elongated streaks, and their transient growth and breakdown lead to the turbulent transition of the boundary layer near the entrance region. The transition of the second boundary layer is induced by the interaction with the first further downstream. After the transition of the second boundary layer, turbulence occupies the whole channel width and a turbulent channel flow develops. The transition is analyzed with the help of an orthogonal decomposition of the solenoidal velocity field. The observed transition scenario differs from existing simulations of streak breakdown where the perturbation is optimized for a transition to occur in a region far away from the entry section. In our simulations, the perturbation setup generates a significant nonlinear growth of the streaks that are pushed away from the wall. Transient varicose instabilities, followed by sinuous instabilities induce the development of mushroom-shaped transitional structures in the outer region of the laminar boundary layer, that further break down downstream. The second boundary-layer transition resembles the one occurring under freestream turbulence, with the generation of finite-length streaks and turbulent spots. ?? 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Environmental flow studies normally involve sampling. Except for hydrologically based methods, the studies usually are conducted only on part of the reach of stream to which the study results will be applied. This assumes that the study sites, or the samples, are representative of the stream as a whole. There is no way to be sure of this without studying the whole stream, but it is possible to estimate how close the study results and the true results are likely to be, if the study uses a probability random) sampling design that allows for estimating confidence intervals. Sampling designs that allow for interval estimates of statistics are normal in science, but, strangely, not in environmental flow studies. Here, I describe and discuss some appropriate sampling designs and related considerations in the context of environmental flow studies. I then describe and critique the sampling in some recent studies using the Physical Habitat Simulation System (PHABSIM), the method most commonly used in the United States, which I describe briefly for readers not familiar with it. Finally, I explain why deliberate selection of samples gives biased results, and describe the experience that persuaded statisticians of this fact early in the twentieth century.

AB  - In a shear flow, a small sphere may experience a lift force due to fluid inertia. Most previous workers assumed that the particle was stationary so that they could treat the fluid motion as steady. In spite of this, the results of previous analyses have generally been applied to problems in which particles move in an unsteady fashion. This paper presents the results of singular perturbation calculations of the lift on a sphere in a linear shear flow. The velocity of the sphere oscillates sinusoidally in time. Although the problem is idealized, the results provide some physical understanding of the effects of unsteadiness and the frequency regime in which one may assume quasisteady conditions.

AB  - Numerical calculations of a lifted H2=N2 turbulent jet flame in a  vitiated coflow of hot gases are presented. The calculations are per-  formed using Magnussen's Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) for tur-  bulent combustion, and are an extension to previously reported EDC  modeling results presented by Cabra et al. (2002). Four dif ferent tur-  bulence models are employed to investigate in more detail the turbu-  lence modeling ef fect on the EDC combustion model with detailed  chemistry. A series of simulations are presented that indicate the  extent to which turbulence models influence the predicted lift-of f  height with the EDC combustion model. Several flow conditions  were tested. For all calculations, EDC predicts more lift-of f by using  the standard k-e model than by using Reynolds-stress-equation (RSE)  models, whereas a modified k-e model predicts less lift-of f than the  RSE models. The reason for the lower predicted lift-of f with the  modified k-e model is because a modified turbulence Prandtl or  Schmidt number in the scalar equations in the modified k-e model  allows an earlier mixing of the hot coflow with the fuel jet. All models  overpredict the lift-of f height for the standard flow conditions.  Recent experiments and numerical calculations by others have shown  that the vitiated coflow flame is extremely sensitive to variations in  the coflow temperature. The present calculations show that this sensi-  tivity is captured by the EDC combustion model, however to a smaller  degree than that previously reported. Calculations with variations in  coflow temperature and jet flow velocity indicate that for each flow con-  dition, the various turbulence models predict the same percentage  increase or decrease in lift-off height. These EDC calculations show that  the turbulence model effect on the EDC predicted lift-off height is  important and that a better flame structure is predicted with the RSE  model by Jones and Musonge than with the other turbulence models.

In thepresent work we investigate the energy growth of eigenmodes andnon-modal optimal disturbances. We present a set of linear governingequations for the parabolic evolution of wavelike disturbances validboth for the exponential and algebraic growth scenario. The base flow istaken as the {FalknerâSkan} similarity solution with favorable, adverseand zero pressure gradients. The optimization is carried out over theinitial streamwise position as well as the spanwise wave number andfrequency. The exponential growth is maximized in the sense that theenvelope of the most amplified eigenmode is calculated. In the case ofalgebraic growth, an adjoint-based optimization technique is used. Wefind that the optimal algebraic disturbance introduced at a certaindownstream position gives rise to a larger growth than for the optimaldisturbance introduced at the leading edge. The exponential andalgebraic growth is compared and a unified transition-predictionmethod based on available experimental data is suggested.

AB  - Chapter 7 focuses on linking the physical and monetary information system. It starts with consistency and consolidation issues to be considered when defining the system boundaries for an EMA assessment and when aggregating data from several sites or companies. The chapter deals with information available on the company level, traces environmental aspects in the balance sheet and where to find them in the profit and loss accounts. Section 7.4 goes one step further down into the organization and highlights the principles and terminology of cost accounting, process flow charts and overhead cost attribution. The concepts of activity based costing and material flow cost accounting are explained as well as where to get the necessary data from stock management and production planning systems. The last issues dealt with are application for investment appraisal, budgeting and benchmarking. Danisco, a global supplier to the food industry, uses EMA as a tool primarily to benchmark production sites, which are divers from a geographical and production process point of view in order to demonstrate differences and similarities.

AB  - The airflow and dispersion of a pollutant in a complex urban area of Beijing, China, were numerically examined by coupling a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model with a mesoscale weather model. The models used were Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software package and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. OpenFOAM was firstly validated against wind-tunnel experiment data. Then, the WRF model was integrated for 42 h starting from 0800 LST 08 September 2009, and the coupled model was used to compute the flow fields at 1000 LST and 1400 LST 09 September 2009. During the WRF-simulated period, a high pressure system was dominant over the Beijing area. The WRF-simulated local circulations were characterized by mountain valley winds, which matched well with observations. Results from the coupled model simulation demonstrated that the airflows around actual buildings were quite different from the ambient wind on the boundary provided by the WRF model, and the pollutant dispersion pattern was complicated under the influence of buildings. A higher concentration level of the pollutant near the surface was found in both the step-down and step-up notches, but the reason for this higher level in each configurations was different: in the former, it was caused by weaker vertical flow, while in the latter it was caused by a downward-shifted vortex. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the coupled WRF-OpenFOAM model is an important tool that can be used for studying and predicting urban flow and dispersions in densely built-up areas.

AB  - With the increasing denitration efficiency of SCR (Selective Catalytic Redn.) system, the flue gas velocity field at an ammonia-injection grid becomes more important in uniform flow of SCR system and mixing technol.  With the SCR system in a high efficiency power plant served as an study object, the influences of ten typical changes of the flue gas velocity field at the AIG on the uniform flow and reducing agent mixing performance in the SCR system of the power plant were analyzed by using a SCR system numerical model which has been verified by a cold state model.  It has been found that for the SCR system with a high denitration efficiency, any change to the velocity field at the AIG exercises a great influence on the distribution of ammonia-nitrogen ratio at the interface of a catalyzer inlet and also a definite influence on the velocity field at the inlet interface.  In a design process, the control of the inhomogeneity of the flow speed at the AIG can enhance the quality of the uniform flow and mixing in the SCR system.  In a high-efficiency SCR system in which a relatively good control over the inhomogeneity of the flow speed at the AIG has been achieved, with an increase of the inhomogeneity, the non-uniformity of the ammonia-nitrogen ratio at the catalyzer inlet will be increased.  The velocity field at the AIG and that of the catalyzer have a similarity. [on SciFinder (R)]

AB  - Computational fluid dynamics modelling of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is commonly simplified to consider a two-dimensional axisymmetric problem. To determine the validity of this assumption, a Floquet stability analysis was employed to predict the conditions under which an axisymmetric aneurysmal flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric instabilities. Dimensions of the model were selected to be consistent with a high-risk aneurysm in the human abdominal aorta. In particular, the model consisted of an elliptical bulge defining the aneurysm, and both upstream and downstream artery sections. A sinusoidal time-varying parabolic velocity profile was input upstream, with Womersley number Î± = 16.9 (representing a heart rate of 70 beats per minute when artery diameter D = 22.7 mm and kinematic viscosity v = 3.3x10 -6 m 2 s). A Reynolds number range relevant to aneurysms in large arteries was examined, with the critical Reynolds number for non-axisymmetric transition and the corresponding azimuthal wavelength found to be Re CRIT = 610 and Î» = Ï (azimuthal mode number m = 2). The maximum vorticity at the vessel wall was found to occur at the distal end of the aneurysm bulge. The pulsatile flow frequency was also varied, with the frequency dependence on Re CRIT and Î» being established.

AB  - Research in the area of laminar flow control (LFC) dates back to the 1930âs when early applications of stability theory led to the observation that laminar boundary layers can be stabilized by either favorable pressure gradients or small amounts of wall suction. (An excellent summary of this work is presented in References 1 and 2.) Research was performed in many countries to explore approaches for achieving extensive laminar flow with these concepts. Stabilization of boundary-layer disturbances and instabilities by pressure gradient and shaping became known as natural laminar flow (NLF), and NACA research led to the development of the six-series NLF airfoil. International research on stabilization by suction, referred to as LFC with suction, was intensive at the same time and culminated in the United States in the 1960âs with flight tests of a relatively unswept suction glove on an F-94 aircraft (Reference 3) and X-21 flight tests (References 4â7) of a totally new swept LFC wing on a reconfigured WB-66 aircraft.

This system models the three-step process necessary for efficient teaching file creation in a PACS environment: (a) identifying and transferring a case quickly and easily during primary interpretation, (b) editing and authoring the case outside of primary interpretation time, and (c) publishing the case locally and via MIRC standard-based mechanisms. Images from interesting cases are e-mailed to the teaching file system from either the PACS workstation or the radiologist's personal computer. Notes and clinical information may be included in the e-mail text to prompt the recollection of case details. Images are automatically extracted from the e-mail and sent to an image repository, and text fields are captured in a database. The World Wide Web-based authoring component provides tools for final authoring of cases and for the manipulation of existing cases. Authors designate access levels for each case, which is then made available locally and, potentially, to the entire MIRC-compliant community. Although this application has not yet been implemented as a departmental solution, it promises to improve and streamline medical education and promote better patient care.

AB  - Heat transfer in a plane laminar shear flow configuration consisting of two infinitely long plates orientated parallel to each other is investigated theoretically. The upper plate, which is planar, drives the flow; the lower one, which is fixed, has a regular sinusoidally varying profile. A closed form analytical solution for velocity, based on lubrication theory, together with a semi-analytic one for temperature, from application of Ritz's direct method, is derived for creeping flow. In addition, detailed numerical solutions are obtained from a finite element formulation of the weak form of the governing equations for mass, momentum and energy (temperature) conservation, enabling the effects of inertia to be explored. It is shown that changes in the mean plate separation, that is the geometry, and the level of inertia present affect the local hydrodynamic flow structure in the form of kinematically and inertially induced eddies, respectively. These in turn impact on the local "laminar thermal mixing", and consequently enhance the global heat transfer. Results are reported for a wide range of Pecl??t, Reynolds and Nusselt numbers with agreement between the two methods of solution, for the case of creeping flow, found to be extremely good. The key flow features that emerge are(i)For creeping flow and varying Pecl??t number, the thermal field is asymmetric for all values of the Pecl??t number other than the limiting conditions of zero and infinity, at which extremes the corresponding thermal field is symmetric. In the limit of infinite Pecl??t number the eddy becomes a basin of fluid at uniform temperature.(ii)Global heat transfer in the case of creeping flow, expressed in terms of the Nusselt number, for a given Pecl??t number increases as the mean plate separation decreases, that is as the local kinematically induced eddy structure becomes more pronounced.(iii)There exists a subtle interplay between variations in the mean plate separation and the level of inertia imposed, in that both influence the presence or otherwise of eddies. Starting from a creeping flow condition the introduction of inertia can in addition both enlarge and skew an existing eddy. When this information is condensed to a series of Nusselt number curves the indication is that it should be possible, from a practical standpoint, to find a critical mean plate separation, for a given Pecl??t number, for which local inertially influenced eddy effects on the global heat transfer are at a minimum. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - An experimental study of the initial flow field downstream of a step change in surface roughness is presented. The roughness length of the downstream surface was approximately tenfold that of the upstream roughness and, unlike all previous studies, attention was concentrated on the roughness sublayer region beneath the inertial (log-law) region. The experiments were conducted at a boundary layer Reynolds number of about 6 x 10(4) (based on layer thickness and free-stream velocity) and around a longitudinal location where the (downstream) roughness length, z(o2),was about 1% of the boundary-layer thickness at the roughness change point. The thickness of the roughness sublayer was found for the two roughness. It was observed that the vertical profiles of mean velocity and turbulence characteristics started to show similarity after about 160(z02) downstream of the roughness change. The presence of a shear stress overshoot is shown to depend strongly on the precise location (with respect to the roughness elements) at which the measurements are made and the thickness of the equilibrium layer is shown to be very sensitive to the way it is defined. It is demonstrated that the growing equilibrium layer has first to encompass the roughness sublayer before any thickness of inertial sublayer can be developed. It follows that, in some practical cases, like flows across some urban environments, the latter (log-law) region may never exist at all.

AB  - In this study, the evolution of the velocity field and scalar concentration fields in stably stratified shear flow is studied using direct numerical simulations. Two cases with vertical mean shear and horizontal mean shear are compared. In both cases, the growth of the turbulent kinetic energy weakens as the Richardson number is increased. However, the horizontal shear case shows a stronger growth of the turbulent kinetic energy than the vertical shear case for a given Richardson number. The ordering of the velocity components was found to change from streamwise > horizontal > vertical in the vertical shear case to streamwise > vertical > horizontal in the horizontal shear case. The fluctuation level of a passive species variable with a vertical mean gradient was observed to be stronger in the horizontal shear case. The ratio of the vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity to the horizontal turbulent eddy diffusivity was found to be larger in the horizontal shear case. (C) 2000 Begell House Inc.

AB  - We assessed the energy requirements and the food consumption of the seabird community of the Beagle Channel in summer. We evaluated differences in energy flow among a priori established zones in the study area and among species. We converted data on densities of seabirds in the channel (February and March 1997) into energy demands. Energy flow to seabirds in shallow waters was twice that of in deep waters. Average energy flow in the whole study area was 9.46X104 kJ.km-2.day-1. Energy intake rates ranged 4-13X104 kJ.km-2.day-1, being higher in zones that include breeding sites or close to them. Imperial Cormorant was the major contributor to energy flow in all the zones followed by the Black-browed Albatross. Kelp Gull was the major contributor in areas where food from human origin was available. Energy flow was similar in four zones, which may represent a saturation point for seabird biomass in the Beagle Channel. The factors that explain the observed energy flow distribution deal with the distribution of shallow water areas in the channel, the presence of seabird's colonies, the proportion of diver and surface feeders, and the possible segregation of, at least, the most abundant species. Finally, food consumption varied from 1.71-3.42 ton/day, being higher near breeding colonies and lower in areas with more open waters

Flexibility of modeling is an important consideration. For transient stability, longer-term dynamics, and small-disturbance stability programs, we recommend the structure of multiple load types connected to a load bus. Load types are static including discharge lighting, induction motors, synchronous motors, and transformer saturation. For each load type, multiple models may be connected to the bus.

AB  - Direct Numerical Simulation of a linearly accelerating channel flow starting from an initially statistically steady turbulent flow has been performed. It is shown that the response of the accelerating flow is fundamentally the same as that of the step-change transient flow described in He and Seddighi (J Fluid Mech 715:60â102, 2013). The flow structure again behaves like a boundary layer bypass transition undergoing three distinct phases, namely, (i) initially (pre-transition), the flow is laminar-like and the pre-existing turbulent structures are modulated resulting in elongated streaks leading to a strong and continuous increase in the streamwise fluctuating velocity but little changes in the other two components; (ii) it then undergoes transition when isolated turbulent spots are generated which spread and merge with each other, and (iii) they eventually cover the entire surface of the wall when the flow is fully turbulent. The similarity between the turbulence responses in the two flows is significant noting the contrasting features of the two types of mean flow unsteadiness: in the step-change flow, a sharp boundary layer is resulted in nearly instantly on the wall which closely resembles the spatially developing boundary layer, whereas the linear flow acceleration causes a continuing change of velocity gradient adjacent to the wall which propagates into the flow field with time, resulting in a gradually-developing boundary layer. There are, however, quantitative differences in the detailed behavior of the two flows and especially the transition is much delayed in the accelerating flow. It is also shown that the late pre-transition and early transition stages in both flows are characterised by significantly increased inwards sweep events in the wall region and ejection events in the outer layer. The flatness of the wall-normal velocity increases markedly near the wall around the time of onset of transition as a consequence of the huge intermittency of the velocity fluctuations. That is, there are long periods of quiescent flow coupled with occasional turbulent bursts.

Thus the method is based on practitionersâ knowledge and enables the construction of a common representation of the urban system. We explain with a Parisian case study how it can be used and how the interdependencies identification contributes to the improvement of urban resilience. Indeed, resilience to disturbances requires an integrated management of all systems impacted and helps decision-makers to plan for reducing losses.

AB  - The elution behaviour of linear and branched polyethylene samples in SEC was studied. For the branched samples an abnormal late co-elution of large and small macromolecules manifests itself as an abnormal re-increase of the molar mass and the radius of gyration values detected with multi angle light scattering at high elution volumes in SEC. The late co-elution of small and large macromolecules cannot be explained by the SEC mechanism alone. The influence of several experimental parameters on the late co-elution was studied. It was found that the type of SEC column and the flow rate have a significant influence. The late eluting part of the sample was fractionated and separated by HT-SEC- and HT-AF4-MALS. The different results of both methods have been discussed with the aim to find possible explanations for the late elution. The experiments indicate that especially large branched structures show an increased tendency for the phenomenon.

AB  - The present article summarises current knowledge on the risk of fetal cardiac malformations in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency (NT), abnormal ductus venosus blood flow pattern and tricuspid regurgitation. The risk of congenital heart disease (CHD) increases with increasing NT. However, nuchal translucency screening is only modestly efficient in the detection of congenital heart disease in low-risk pregnancies. If the nuchal translucency is normal, abnormal ductus venosus blood flow and tricuspid regurgitation show low sensitivities as single screening parameters. The combination of all 3 markers might increase the detection rates. Fetal echocardiography at 20 weeks of gestation is recommended in foetuses with an NT â¥95th percentile, as the incidence of CHD increases 2.5-fold. When the NT measurement is â¥99th percentile, the risk of CHD increases 10-fold. In this high-risk group and in fetuses with tricuspid regurgitation and/or an abnormal DV flow pattern along with an increased NT, first or early second trimester echocardiography performed by experts is warranted. The early examination of the fetal heart should be completed by a detailed echocardiogram at around 20 weeks of gestation.

AB  - Recently Lee and Balachandar proposed analytically-based expressions for drag and lift coefficients for a spherical particle moving on a flat wall in a linear shear flow at finite Reynolds number. In order to evaluate the accuracy of these expressions, we have conducted direct numerical simulations of a rolling particle for shear Reynolds number up to 100. We assume that the particle rolls on a horizontal flat wall with a small gap separating the particle from the wall (L= 0.505) and thus avoiding the logarithmic singularity. The influence of the shear Reynolds number and the translational velocity of the particle on the hydrodynamic forces of the particle was investigated under both transient and the final drag-free and torque-free steady state. It is observed that the quasi-steady drag and lift expressions of Lee and Balachandar provide good approximation for the terminal state of the particle motion ranging from perfect sliding to perfect rolling. With regards to transient particle motion in a wall-bounded shear flow it is observed that the above validated quasi-steady drag and lift forces must be supplemented with appropriate wall-corrected added-mass and history forces in order to accurately predict the time-dependent approach to the terminal steady state. Quantitative comparison with the actual particle motion computed in the numerical simulations shows that the theoretical models quite effective in predicting rolling/sliding motion of a particle in a wall-bounded shear flow at moderate Re. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The develoment of the laminar velocity and pressure fields in the hydrodynamic entrance region of rectangular ducts has been explored experimentally. Duct cross sections having aspect ratios of 5:1 and 2:1 were employed in the investigation; air was the working fluid. It was found that the development of the pressure field is much more rapid than that of the velocity field. The entrance length, relative to pressure development, is representable as (z/De)/Re=0.02 for both ducts. The incremental pressure drop due to the development of the flow was deduced from the experimental data as being approximately equal to one velocity head. The axial development of the velocity field is illustrated by a sequence of velocity profiles measured along the symmetry lines of the cross section. The flow development in the 5:1 duct is found to be somewhat more rapid than in the 2:1 duct. Comparisons of the experimental results are made with available predictions of analysis, all of which are based on approximate models of the flow field. In general, the analyses overpredict the incremental pressure drop due to flow development. The development of the velocity field appears to be reasonably well described by analysis.

The numerical method handles fluctuations of density in space and in time, but assumes density to be independent of pressure (incompressibility). The chemical composition of the fluid is described by solving the filtered transport equation for mixture fraction f . Density, viscosity and temperature are evaluated assuming chemical equilibrium. To account for sub-grid fluctuations of f , its sub-grid distribution is presumed to have the shape of a Î²-function. The results of the simulation are discussed extensively. The influence of inlet boundary conditions is addressed and radial profiles at different axial positions are shown for a complete set of one-point statistical data. Agreement of numerical results and experimental data is very good. Furthermore, a comparison of Reynolds- and Favre-averages is done and energy spectra at different locations in the flame are discussed.

Properties of CNT such as the type of functionalisation, charge density, and the dispersibility profile are expected to modulate CNT cellular uptake and toxicity profile in vitro. The assay described here allows for rapid screening of CNT cellular uptake in vitro and assessing the acute cytotoxicity simultaneously. CNT cellular uptake is measured qualitatively by light scattering analysis without differentiating between cell binding and internalisation of the CNT by the cells. In addition, flow cytometry is used to combine light scattering analysis with flow cytometry-based Annexin V/propidium iodide assay to measure the cytotoxicity. This assay is rapid, reliable, and allows for comparative analysis between various types of CNT studied.

AB  - The present study provides a comparison between the flow pattern around two circular piers in tandem and a single pier set up on a moderately rough flat bed in a laboratory flume. Velocities are measured by an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV). The contours of the time-averaged velocity components, Reynolds shear stresses, turbulence intensities and turbulence kinetic energy at different planes are presented. Streamlines and vectors are used to study the flow features. The analysis of power spectra around the piers is also presented. The results show that the presence of downstream pier changes the flow structure to a great extent, particularly in the near-wake region. Within the gap between the two piers, a stronger and substantial upflow is shaped. However, a weaker transverse-deflection is formed in comparison with that in the single pier. Near the bed, the velocity of flow approaching the downstream pier decreases to 0.2-0.3 times of the approach mean velocity (U (0)) due to the sheltering effect of the upstream pier. In the wake of downstream pier, the flow structure is completely different from the one in the wake of single pier. In comparison with the single pier, the values of turbulence kinetic energy and turbulence intensities show a considerable decrease around the tandem piers. In tandem piers, the high values of turbulence characteristics are found near the downstream pier. There is a recirculation zones just upstream of the sheltered pier close to the bed and another behind that pier near the free surface. The results show a decrease in the strength of vortical structure in the wake of tandem piers in comparison with single pier. It is shown that the formation of flow with different Reynolds number along the flow depth due to the effect of bed roughness, as well as pier spacing, can influence the type of flow regime of tandem case. In addition to enhancing the flow structure indulgence, the present detailed measurements can also be used for verification of numerical models.

AB  - Explicit Algebraic Reynolds Stress Models (EARSM) pro- vide a better description of the Reynolds stress tensor than the classical eddy viscosity models. Therefore, they act as a SST limiter and improve separation prediction. They also allow to easily capture rotation and curvature effects. However, the classical derivation of EARSM models relies upon the notion of turbulence time scale, which is available in two-equation models but not in models solving only one transport equation for the eddy viscosity. A way to extend EARSM modelling to one equation models is proposed. For the sake of simplicity only two-dimensional flows are addressed. Applications to simple flows such as homogeneous shear plus rotation, and boundary layer flows without pressure gradient or close to separation are given to validate the model.

AB  - Two-phase pressure driven laminar stratified pipe flow is studied with emphasis on the wall and interfacial shear stresses. The basic solution of the Navier-Stokes equations is recast into a simpler form, alleviating physical interpretation and constituting a convenient basis for further developments. Utilizing two-phase symmetry facilitates writing the velocity field for each phase as one generic expression, which is then split into a linear combination of two terms. The first term equals the single-phase free surface flow of either phase due to the given driving forces. The second term links the phases together and represents the shear flow given by the interfacial drag from the opposite phase. The corresponding expression for the interfacial shear stress now emerges naturally as part of the solution of the boundary value problem. The wall shear stresses are obtained by formal differentiation. The limiting behaviour of the wall and interfacial shear stresses in the triple points, where the fluid-fluid interface meets the pipe wall, is obtained by application of residue calculus. Surprisingly, it proves possible to integrate out the Fourier integrals in the expressions for the mean wall and interfacial shear stresses. The expressions for the mean wall shear stresses are demonstrated to be equivalent to the fluid momentum balances, thus confirming consistency. The new and remarkably simple closed form expression for the mean interfacial shear stress, however, represents the local solution of the boundary value problem at the interface, not obtainable from a regular force balance. It thus complements the momentum balances, facilitating a simple computation of the exact general solution for the mean wall and interfacial shear stresses for a given holdup and pressure drop in a given pipe containing a given pair of fluids. The equation system developed here forms the basis for the inversion of the laminar stratified pipe flow problem in terms of flow rates. The corresponding, however, considerably more transparent, channel flow solution is utilized as a guide to the pipe flow problem. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large landslides are often characterised by complex activity resulting from their ability to suddenly change behaviour. In fact, these landslides can pass from a slump to a flow characterised by relatively high mobility. This characteristics is a cause of extremely high severity and hazard in areas affected by such phenomena. An interesting case of a large slide in glacial deposits, which occurred in 1993 in the Valcamonica of the Italian Alps, is presented. Different approaches both to characterise the coarse frictional materials involved in the slide and to model the slide initiation and its evolution are adopted. The initial slide mass had a volume of almost 2 Mm3 and after its initial sliding motion along the slope, flowed for about 7 km down the main valley stream. Voight's method has been used to analyse measured slope displacements recorded for a few years before the slope failure. This analysis provided evidence that different times of failure could have been predicted beforehand by rigorous examination of the available data. Laboratory tests and image/processing techniques have been performed to characterise the landslide material as resembling a "bimrock" (block in matrix material). Slope stability analyses have been performed and a dynamic modelling method has been tested on the flow by comparing its results to those obtained by analysis of eyewitness statements and field observations on the mudline left by the flow. Finally, existing empirical approaches for hazard assessment on an alluvial fan have been applied and modified to produce a hazard zonation map for the alluvial fan area by considering maximum expected discharge, local geometry of the channel and the possibility of channel occlusion and subsequent avulsion. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Experiments were conducted in a horizontal flow loop (24 mm i.d.), using an electrochemical technique, for measuring liquid-to-wall shear stress, at Various positions around the pipe circumference. Measurements of liquid film thickness, pressure drop as well as visual observations were also made. These data complement similar information obtained by Paras et al. (1994), in a horizontal 50.8 mm i.d. flow system. Mean values and other statistical information are obtained from the analysis of the shear stress and film thickness data. Visual studies of the gas/liquid interface confirm that its profile is concave rather than flat. The data show that the time-averaged shear stress tends to decrease in the lateral direction (i.e. away from the pipe bottom, Theta = 0 degrees) along which the liquid film gradually becomes thinner. Only for relatively low superficial gas velocities (e.g. U-G < 15 m/s), the mean shear stress is almost constant up to Theta = 45 degrees; i.e. in a flow region where there is a relatively thick liquid layer. An expression is proposed for predicting the shear stress circumferential distribution. By means of momentum balances (utilizing the new data), the average gas/liquid interfacial friction factor is determined with improved accuracy. Additionally an equivalent gas/liquid interface roughness is expressed in terms of wave characteristics, i.e. wave intermittency and amplitude. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The nature of supersonic, turbulent, adiabatic-wall flow in a square duct is investigated experimentally over a development length 0 < x/D < 20 for a uniform flow with a Mach 3.9 condition at the duct inlet. The experiments were conducted in a duct that was designed specifically to minimize wave effects and nozzle-induced distortion in the flow. Total pressure contours and local skin friction coefficient distributions show that the flow develops in a manner similar to that observed for the incompressible case. In particular, undulations exist in total pressure contours within the cross plane and in transverse skin friction coefficient distributions, indicating the presence of a well-defined secondary flow superimposed upon the primary flow. The results are analyzed to show that local law-of-the-wall behavior extends well into the corner region, which implies that wall functions conventionally applied in two-equation-type turbulence models, when suitably defined for compressible flow, may also be applied to supersonic streamwise corner flows.

AB  - Flow patterns for adiabatic vertical downward air-water flow in an 8.8. mm diameter channel have been studied. In particular, the influence of the inlet device, the flow history and the development length on the flow pattern have been investigated and assessed. Test results with two inlet devices (highly mixed and unmixed) indicate that the inlet device has a major influence on the flow pattern transitions. Furthermore, the transition boundaries between different flow regimes have been found to depend strongly on the flow's development length, and display hysteresis effects. Not surprisingly, no existing flow pattern map worked well versus the current observations, nor did they agree with one another, thus pointing the need to better characterize the test section inlet geometry, the influence of the test length and the test procedure to obtain genuine flow pattern observations. Presently, it can be concluded that in each flow pattern region there are important differences in the actual flow structures. A future mechanistic flow pattern map should then not only contain flow pattern transition lines but also physical characteristics which describe the flow regime and inlet device effects. This was qualitatively done in this study by superimposing on the flow pattern maps frames which illustrate the characteristics of the flow for two different inlet devices. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The effect of a negative free-stream mean-shear velocity distribution on the boundary layer development on a flat plate with a semi-circular leading edge is studied experimentally and computationally. The geometry is the same as in the T3L test case of the ERCOFTAC Special Interest Group on Transition. The existence of a negative shear is related to the transition of the boundary layer from laminar to turbulent through separation. The flow investigated here has the same general characteristics as the one presented in a recent work by the authors, Palikaras et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 23 (2002) 455-470], where the boundary layer development has been studied under free-stream conditions of uniform and positive mean-shear velocity distributions. The negative shear flow in the core region of the wind tunnel has a value ?????/???y = -27.7 s-1, which is the opposite to the case examined by Palikaras et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 23 (2002) 455-470]. In the first part of the paper, a detailed description of the flow is given. The measured quantities are presented, discussed and compared with the computational analysis in order to obtain a complete picture of the investigated flow. For the computations, the non-linear k-?? model of Craft et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow 17 (1996) 108-115] is used, and satisfactory predictions are reported. In the second part, a detailed comparison of the results with the cases of uniform and positive mean-shear velocity inlet distribution is carried out. In the case of negative mean velocity the separated boundary layer leads to a larger reverse flow region than the two other cases. A relation is observed between the location of the stagnation point at the leading edge and the presence or absence of shear. When mean shear is present, depending on the sign, there is a movement of the stagnation point away from the symmetry line of the flat plate and it is believed that this is the driving mechanism that affects the boundary layer development and the longitudinal size of the reverse flow region. This remark is supported by the observation that for all the three cases studied, the longitudinal RMS distribution above the reverse flow region and in the free-stream region has the same values. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - According to the 2007 world demographic revision report of the United Nations, urban areas are expected to absorb 60% of the world's population by 2030. Developed countries have experienced the effect of urban development on their water resources since the Second World War and today think about alternative techniques and management rules to protect them. Solutions are developed under the scope of the resilience concept to cope with global change effects, i.e. both land-use and climate changes. We deal here with the consequences and the way to get quantitative evidence on how urban development can change flood and low flow regimes. We also address how on-site rainwater retention can help to mitigate such effects. This paper is connected with the paper entitled "Flood risk mitigation using dry reservoirs in a global change perspective" presented by Radojevic et al. (2010b).

AB  - A system for precision measurement of fluid velocity is developed and applied to determine the laminar flow distribution in a square duct. The experimental technique consists of measuring the Doppler shift of laser radiation scattered by particles moving with the fluid. From this frequency shift, the fluid velocity is inferred. Measurements in the entrance region and fully developed flow region of a square duct indicate that the velocity profile development takes place in a somewhat longer section of the duct than had been predicted. Measurements of the fully developed flow indicate that the optical technique used is capable of measuring velocity within an accuracy of at least 0.1 percent.

AB  - The predictive properties of several non-linear eddy-viscosity models are investigated by reference to highly-resolved LES data obtained by the authors for an internal flow featuring massive separation from a curved surface. The test geometry is a periodic segment of a channel constricted by two-dimensional (2D) `hills' on the lower wall. The mean-flow Reynolds number is 21560. Periodic boundary conditions are applied in the streamwise and spanwise directions. This makes the statistical properties of the simulated flow genuinely 2D and independent from boundary conditions, except at the walls. The simulation was performed on a high-quality, 5M-node grid. The focus of the study is on the exploitation of the LES data for the mean-flow, Reynolds stresses and macro-length-scale. Model solutions are first compared with the LES data, and selected models are then subjected to a-priori studies designed to elucidate the role of specific model fragments in the non-linear stress-strain/vorticity relation and their contribution to observed defects in the mean-flow and turbulence fields. The role of the equation governing the length-scale, via different surrogate variables, is also investigated. It is shown that, while most non-linear models overestimate the separation region, due mainly to model defects that result in insufficient shear stress in the separated shear layer, model forms can be derived which provide a satisfactory representation of the flow. One such model is identified. This combines a particular quadratic constitutive relation with a wall-anisotropy term, a high-normal-strain correction and a new form of the equation for the specific dissipation Ï = â/k.

AB  - Abstract This paper describes a finite difference experiment to simulate the transient development of the convection column above a strip of uniform high temperature source in a stratified uniform cross flow atmosphere. The ?-Îµ model of turbulence is used and an upstream weighted scheme for this vorticity-stream function formulation is employed. Some computation results for a 195?m wide source are presented. The immediate goal of the undertaking was to devise a scheme which could yield realistic flow ?boundary conditions? in the immediate vicinity of a fire to enable one to model the detailed structure of the fire region. The predictions arc quite consistent with observations and this provides the link between the heat source and environmental parameters. This scheme, together with a refined near zone fire model, can be used to describe the interplay between the heat source (fire) component and the environmental components of a mass fire system

AB  - The Hesperian-Amazonian age volcanic shield, Alba Patera, has associated with it some of the largest volcanic flows on Mars. An early (Hesperian) flood-lava phase was followed by the extrusion of high-volume sheet and tube-fed lavas, many of which emerged from fissures on the flanks of a rising dome. Subsequently a plethora of sheet and tube-fed lavas were erupted from linear vents located either at or within 200 km of the present summit. These built complex flow fields which were erupted at rates several orders of magnitude greater than the maximum Hawaiian rates. Later (Amazonian) volcanism at Alba saw extrusions of long, narrow flows from two complex summit calde- ras whose formation is inferred to have been a direct result of magma supply to the volcano's flanks. The outflow of thermal energy related to emplacement of some single flows (6 x 10 ~ ergs) was substantially greater than the Earth's annual heat loss through volcanism and implies that patera building must have been a significant source of geologi- cally rapid heat loss from Mars during the early stages of volcanic centralization on the planet.

AB  - 'Transforming Cities with Transit' explores the complex process of transit and land-use integration in rapidly growing cities in developing countries. As one of the most promising strategies for advancing environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, and socially inclusive development in fast-growing cities, transit and land-use integration is increasingly being embraced by policy-makers at all levels of government. This book focuses on identifying barriers to and opportunities for effective coordination of transport infrastructure and urban development. Global best-case practices of transit-oriented metropolises that have direct relevance to cities in developing countries are first introduced. Key institutional, regulatory, and financial constraints that hamper integration and opportunities to utilize transit to guide sustainable urban development are examined in selected cities in developing countries. For this, the book analyzes their Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems and their impact on land development. The book formulates recommendations and implementation strategies to overcome barriers and take advantage of opportunities. It asserts that unprecedented opportunities have and will continue to arise for the successful integration of transit and land development in much of the developing world. Many cities in developing countries currently exhibit the pre-requisites - e.g., rapid growth, rising real incomes, and increased motorization and congestion levels - for BRT and railway investments to trigger meaningful land-use changes in economically and financially viable ways. Recommendations for creating more sustainable cities of the future range from macro-level strategies that influence land development and governance at the metropolitan scale to micro-level initiatives, like Transit Oriented Development (TOD), that can radically transform development patterns at the neighborhood level. The book will be of interest to a wide and diverse audience, including mayors, council members and other national and local policy makers, urban and transportation planners, transit-agency officials, and developers and staff of development financial institutions and others involved with TOD projects in rapidly growing and motorizing cities of the developing world.

AB  - Split-flow thin (SPLITT) fractionation devices have been widely used to separate macromolecules, colloids, cells and particles. Recently, the quadrupole magnetic flow sorter (QMS) has been reported in the literature as another family of SPLITT fractionation device. However, the separation performance observed in the experimental measurements is generally found to deviate from the ideal behaviour. Possible causes such as hydrodynamic lift force, high particle concentration and imperfect geometries have been extensively examined. However, the effects of flow development regions and fringing magnetic force field at the separation channel inlet and outlet, which are ignored by the theory, have not been investigated. The error introduced by ignoring these effects need to be rigorously studied so that the theory can be used to optimise operation flow rates with confidence. Indeed, we find in this paper that these ignored effects are responsible to the discrepancy between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. A new theory has been proposed for optimisation of device operation. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We applied frequency domain analysis to detect and quantify spontaneous fluctuations in the blood flow velocity of the middle cerebral artery (MCAFV). Instantaneous MCAFV of normal volunteers was detected using transcranial Doppler sonography. Spectral and transfer function analyses of MCAFV and arterial blood pressure (ABP) were performed by fast Fourier transform. We found the fluctuations in MCAFV, like ABP, could be diffracted into three components at specific frequency ranges, designated as high-frequency (HF, 0.15 to 0.4 Hz), low-frequency (LF, 0.04 to 0.15 Hz), and very low-frequency (VLF, 0.016 to 0.04 Hz) components. The HF and LF components of MCAFV exhibited high coherence with those of ABP, indicating great similarity of MCAFV and ABP fluctuations within the two frequency ranges. However, it was not the case for the VLF component. Transfer function analysis revealed that the ABP-MCAFV phase angle was frequency-dependent in the LF range (r = -0.79, P < 0.001) but not in the HF range. The time delay between LF fluctuations of ABP and those of MCAFV was evaluated as 2.1 seconds. We conclude that in addition to traditional B-wave equivalents, there are at least two different mechanisms for MCAFV fluctuations: the HF and LF fluctuations of MCAFV are basically secondary to those of ABP, and cerebral autoregulation may operate efficiently in LF rather than HF range. Frequency domain analysis offers an opportunity to explore the nature and underlying mechanism of dynamic regulation in cerebral circulation.

The sensor device consists of a flexible micro-pillar which extends from the wall into the viscous sublayer. The pillar-tip deflection caused by the exerting fluid forces serves as a measure for the local wall-shear stress. The pillar is statically calibrated in linear shear flow. A second-order estimate of the pillar dynamic response based on experimentally determined sensor characteristics shows the potential of the present sensor configuration to also measure the dynamic wall-shear stress. The quality of the micro-pillar shear stress sensor MPS3 to correctly determine the skin friction will be shown by measuring the wall friction in a well-defined fully developed turbulent pipe flow at Reynolds numbers Reb based on the bulk velocity Ub and the pipe diameter D in the range of Reb = 10, 000 s(-) 20, 000. The results demonstrate a convincing agreement of the mean and dynamic wall-shear stress obtained with the MPS3 sensor technique with analytical, experimental, and numerical results from the literature.

AB  - The flow characteristics of theMTL wind-tunnel at the Department ofMechan- ics, KTH, have been evaluated 10 years after its completion. The wind-tunnel is of closed circuit type with a 7 m long test section that has a cross section area of 1.2 Ã 0.8 m2. The contraction ratio is 9 and the maximum speed is approximately 70 m/s. The experiments performed included measurements of total pressure variation, temperature variation, flow angle variation and turbu- lence intensity variation. The measurements were carried out in the test section over a cross flow measurement area of 0.9Ã0.5 m2 located 0.4 m downstream the inlet. The temperature variation in time was also measured at the center of the measurement area. The experiments were performed at three different wind-tunnel speeds, 10, 25 and 40 m/s. The present results confirm the high flow quality of the MTL wind-tunnel. The flow quality measurements carried out soon after the completion of the tunnel are here repeated and extended. For instance, at 25 m/s the streamwise turbulence intensity is less than 0.025% and both the cross flow turbulence intensities are less than 0.035% at the same speed. The total pressure variation is less than Â±0.06% and the temperature variation is less than Â±0.05â¦C.

The obstacle simulated in the\ndomain is implemented by local forcing of the flow with a procedure\nthat adjusts locally the shear stress at the position of the object\nin conjunction with a non-penetration condition on the body walls.\nThis approach has already been successfully applied by Breugem and\nBoersma (Phys.

AB  - Gross flow development patterns have been monitored during slurry packing and compared for PEEK and stainless-steel liquid chromatographic microbore columns for different sorbents and slurry compositions. Flow-rate, pressure and apparent permeability data were collected with the help of a computer-aided monitoring technique. The development of the packing process under constant-pressure conditions, as detected by changes in the flow, has been found to have four characteristic stages, the development of which correlates with the final degree of compaction of the porous bed and with column efficiency. The parameters characterising porous structure - specific permeability, K(o), and specific column resistance, have been compared for different groups of packed columns. It has been found that they correlate weakly with the column efficiency and the packing pressure for the same group of sorbents and packing slurry chemical composition. However, packings performed under the same pressure regime but using differing slurry media produced different flow patterns and have shown vast variation both in the column efficiency and in the specific column resistance. The range of specific column resistance values observed in this study for 0.5-mm I.D. microcolumns was 250<??<900. A correlation of ?? with the column tubing material has been observed and attributed to wall effects. The proposed method for the assessment of the effectiveness of the packing procedure enables changes in the dynamics of the packing process caused by changes of the slurry chemistry or other packing parameters to be observed and thus, the packing procedure for new stationary phases to be effectively adjusted. The expected column efficiency (and particularly packing failure) can be estimated during packing, prior to chromatographic assessment of the column.

AB  - Flows around missiles, rockets and projectiles often expe- rience baseflow separation. This means that the pressure behind the base is considerably lower than the freestream pressure, causing base drag that often constitutes a large portion of the total drag. The present study is motivated by the fact that most methods used for reducing the drag often also reduce the aerodynamic stability of the vehicle. Semi- analytical methods and Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) models often fail to provide accurate results for such flows, and therefore we use Large Eddy Simulations (LES) to investigate the flow physics of axisymmetric baseflow in a configuration for which experimental data is available for comparison. Good agreement with experi- mental data, with and without, base bleed is obtained for several LES models, suggesting that the details of the sub- grid model are of less importance. The simulation data are also examined with the intention of increasing our knowl- edge of the underlying flow physics.

AB  - Experimental results of the time-dependent velocity and vorticity field in the region of vortex breakdown in a tube flow using Particle-Image-Velocimetry (PIV) are reviewed and discussed here. The results show the essential characteristics of the development of vortex breakdown and the distinct topological structure of both predominant forms, the bubble- and the spiral-type. Comparison of the generation process of circumferential vorticity during development of vortex breakdown reveals good agreement with the theoretical prediction. This confirms the idea of feedback as the key-mechanism for rapid development of vortex breakdown. The bubble-type breakdown is viewed as the fundamental breakdown type where the circumferential vorticity is distributed in a form of an elliptical vortex-ring-like structure. The evolution of asymmetry after generation of the bubble can be explained as the consequence of imbalance of rearward feed-in of mass and given limitations in bubble's growth and upstream migration. The asymmetry causes, due to induction, the front stagnation point to be deflected radial away, which begins to rotate around the axis but remains still dose to the centerline. The dynamical behaviour inside the bubble can be explained by the the model of a tilted vortex ring, which gyrates and compensates the feed-in by mass exchange at the rear end of the bubble. A second introduced feedback mechanism can explain the transition to spiral-type breakdown. Accordingly, the asymmetry triggers itself at a critical degree and leads to a radial deflection of the stagnation point of order of the characteristic vortex core radius. This again leads to the unilateral deflection of the approaching vortex core.

AB  - The sensitivity of orifice plate flow meters to the quality of the approaching flow continues to be a cause for concern in flow metering. The distortions caused by pipe fittings such as valves, bends, compressors and other devices located upstream of the orifice plate can lead to non-standard velocity profiles and give errors in measurement. The design of orifice plate meters that are independent of the initial flow conditions of the upstream is a major goal in flow metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal.The effect of a fractal flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions was obtained in experimental work and also using simulations. The measurement of mass flow rate under different conditions and different Reynolds numbers was used to establish a change in discharge coefficient relative to a standard one. The experimental results using the fractal flow conditioner show that the combination of an orifice plate and a fractal flow conditioner is broadly insensitive to upstream disturbances.The simulation results also show that the device can be used as a part of a flow metering package that will considerably reduce installation lengths. Previous work with orifice plates has shown that a combination of flow conditioner and orifice plate was promising. The results of using a combination of the fractal flow conditioner and orifice plate for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show that this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the Standards. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The mean-flow structure of supersonic, turbulent, adiabatic-wall flow in a square duct is investigated experi- mentally over a development length of 50 duct widths for a uniform flow, Mach 3.9 condition at the duct inlet. The results show that a secondary flow cell structure develops that is similar to that for the incompressible case. This secondary flow distorts the primary flow, whose behavior also is influenced by shear-layer interaction ef- fects as the wall boundary layers merge. Axial mean-velocity profiles plotted in terms of van Driest-scaled varia- bles show that a well-defined log-law region exists in the near-wall layer. This region exists in the presence of a secondary flow that continuously modifies spanwise wall shear stress behavior along the length of the duct.

AB  - The link between edge sheared flows and turbulence is investigated in the plasma edge region of the TJ-II stellarator and the results are compared with results in other devices like JET tokamak. In the TJ-II stellarator there is a threshold density to trigger the development of edge shear flows. During sheared flow development the degree of turbulence anisotropy (<(upsilon) over tilde (parallel to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)>) is modified. The fact that different quadratic terms in fluctuating velocities (<(upsilon) over tilde (parallel to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)> and <(upsilon) over tilde (perpendicular to) (upsilon) over tilde (r)>) change during edge sheared flow generation means that shear flow physics involves 3D physics phenomena in which both perpendicular and parallel dynamics are involved. A new strategy has been recently applied to plasma physics to quantify the local energy transfer between flows and turbulence by computing the production term. Experimental results show that turbulence can act as an energy sink and energy source for the mean flow near the shear layer. Measurements of the turbulence production show the importance of 3D effects on the energy transfer between flows and turbulence

AB  - In spite of strenuous efforts over the last half century, the engineering prediction of flow and sediment transport over bedforms, in general, and dunes, in particular, still presents a major obstacle in the solution of sedimentation problems in alluvial channels. Fig. 1 illustrates the presence of dunes in the field ~the Rhine River in The Netherlands!. The basic problem of sediment transport can be stated in a deceptively simple manner: given sediment and fluid characteristics, channel geometry, and discharge, what is the expected flow depth and the amount of sediment that will be transported? Even for the simplest case of a well-sorted sediment in a straight prismatic channel with rigid banks, a general answer to these two questions ~to be referred to hereafter as the basic questions! can only be given with an uncomfortably high degree of uncertainty, and much of the difficulty can be traced to the development of bed forms. The traditional approach to dealing with the effect of dunes is described in the standard monographs on sediment transport. The earlier review by Engelund and Fredsoe ~1982! provides a convenient point of reference. From an engineering point of view, the approach described in a series of papers by van Rijn ~1984a,b,c! has been influential. Has our understanding or predictive ability improved to any significant extent since the appearance of these reviews/papers? Advances in measurement and simulation technologies as well as progress in the understanding of related phenomena such as turbulent wall-bounded flows have stimulated recent research that may contribute to a more adequate response to the basic questions. Moreover, the topic has attracted the attention not only of researchers in hydraulics but also of earth scientists ~e.g., Allen 1984!, with potentially useful results and contributions being published in disparate journals and monographs not necessarily familiar to the sedimentation engineering community. An ASCE Task Committee has therefore been formed with the aim of examining, and where possible, synthesizing, state-of-the-art knowledge concerning flow and sediment transport over dunes, emphasizing the progress ~if any! over the past 20 years. To organize the discussion, the various aspects of the problem may be broadly divided into two categories, namely, ~1! equilibrium, and ~2! transient or developmental. The former involves ââfully-developedââ dunes that have evolved from an approximately steady uniform flow; whereas, the latter includes questions dealing with instabilities and transitions when bed-form characteristics are still changing with time. The description and analysis of equilibrium aspects may be more tractable in that only a final, potentially unique state, more or less easily accessible to experimental observation, is of interest. Transient problems, being concerned with a continuum of states, would seem to pose greater difficulties, theoretical as well as experimental and, not surprisingly, are likely associated with the largest errors in predictions. Because the real-world problem of dunes in natural streams may involve such a multitude of factors, including temporally and spatially varying flow as well as dune and channel geometry and sediment heterogeneity, laboratory and theoretical/numerical studies have almost invariably chosen to investigate simplified cases in the hopes of elucidating essential mechanisms. Such an approach would also seem wise for a review: is there consensus on what would be the essence of the problem, stripped of all ââhigher-orderââ effects? Would it be dunes in a straight laboratory channel formed from uniformly sized sediment under a steady discharge? If so, what can be said definitively about even this simplest case? Ultimately, any theoretical model must be evaluated on its efficacy in explaining and/or predicting real-world ââmessyââ phenomena and on its agreement with measurements from field studies, such that the limitations of simplifications must be kept keenly in mind.

AB  - Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of small prolate ellipsoidal particles suspended in a turbulent channel flow is reported. The coupling between the fluid and the particles is one-way. The particles are subjected to the hydrodynamic drag force and torque valid for creeping flow conditions. Six different particle cases with varying particle aspect ratios and equivalent response times are investigated. Results show that, in the near-wall region, ellipsoidal particles tend to align with the mean flow direction, and the alignment increases with increasing particle aspect ratio. When the particle inertia increases, the particles are less oriented in the spanwise direction and more oriented in the wall-normal direction. In the core region of the channel, the orientation becomes isotropic. 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the hydraulic jump has been investigated experimentally for nearly two centuries, little information is known of the air-water flow properties in the shear region. New experiments were performed in a horizontal channel with partially-developed inflow conditions. Distributions of air concentration, mean air-water velocity and bubble frequency were recorded and presented herein. The results indicate an advective diffusion of air in the shear layer. The velocity profiles have a similar shape as wall jet flows but different quantitative parameters must be introduced. The relationship between air content and bubble frequency has a parabolic shape which is not yet understood but was observed previously in open channel flows. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The flow over a trailing edge is computed using two dif- ferent techniques to reduce the computational costs of LES. A hybrid method designed to split the contributions of the averaged and fluctuating velocity fields is used in order to re- lax the near-wallmesh requirements. A syntheticmethod for turbulence generation is used at the inlet in order to avoid a costly precursor simulation. The methodology has been first tested on channel flows at high Reynolds numbers on coarse meshes. The results at different Reynolds numbers up to ReÏ are presented. They agree well with DNS data avail- able in terms of mean velocities and stresses. The results for the trailing-edge flow are compared with the full LES with inlet boundary conditions from a precursor boundary layer simulation. Two cases are presented, one with a precursor simulation and one with the synthetic eddy method. The predictions of mean velocities and turbulent content agree well with the reference LES simulation.

AB  - Laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG) allows for the quantitative estimation of blood flow in the optic nerve head, choroid, retina and iris in vivo. It was developed to facilitate the non-contact analysis of ocular blood flow in living eyes, utilizing the laser speckle phenomenon. The technique uses a fundus camera, a diode laser, an image sensor, an infrared charge-coupled device (CCD) camera and a high-resolution digital CCD camera. Normalized blur (NB), an approximate reciprocal of speckle contrast, represents an index of blood velocity, and shows a good correlation with tissue blood flow rates determined with the microsphere method in the retina, choroid or iris, as well as blood flow rates determined with the hydrogen gas clearance method in the optic nerve head. The square blur ratio (SBR), another index for quantitative estimation of blood velocity, is proportional to the square of the NB. The SBR is theoretically a more exact measurement which is proportional to velocity, whereas the NB is an approximation. Normalized blur was calculated in earlier versions of LSFG because of technical limitations; the SBR is used in current versions of the LSFG instrument. As these values are in arbitrary units, they should not be used to make comparisons between different eyes or different sites in an eye. Clinical protocols, calibration, evaluation procedures and possible limitations of the LSFG technique are described and the results of ocular blood flow studies using LSFG are briefly summarized. The LSFG method is suitable for monitoring the time-course of change in the tissue circulation at the same site in the same eye at various intervals, ranging from seconds to months. Unresolved issues concern the effect of pupil size on measurement results, the effects of various stimulations, and how to measure choroidal and retinal blood flow velocity separately without using the blue-component of argon laser.

AB  - The development of the mean velocity and turbulence intensity downstream of a standard tube bundle and three different slotted plates has been measured in a four inch pipe using a 1-D laser Doppler anemometer system. The results show how far the standard tube bundle must be placed upstream of the orifice plate to obtain fully developed mean velocity and turbulence. Numerical analyses of how shaping the velocity profile exiting a flow conditioner effects the development of both the turbulence and mean velocity have been performed. These analyses indicate that a power law profile (1/7th) with a 9% turbulence intensity produces a fully developed flow in the shortest pipe length, 20 D. A parabolic profile requires a slightly longer development length. A uniform flow required the longest length of pipe. The effect of the turbulence intensity produced by the flow conditioner was also investigated. Three different slotted plates were manufactured to produce a 1/7th power law, parabolic, and uniform velocity profile downstream of the plate. The development of the mean velocity and turbulence have been measured. These data were compared to the predictions with very favorable results. The simulations accurately represented the flow field and turbulence intensity distibutions.

The Reynolds number based on channel height were approx- imately 40Ã103, 105Ã103, and 185Ã103. Mean velocity profiles were taken with a Pitot-static tube between distances of 70 and 205 heights from the inlet. A vertical shiftâthe di- rect result of a change in skin frictionâis found to be the most salient indication of under-development in the velocity profile. It is suggested that commonly used criteria for fully developed flow may be inadequate to detect these first instances of under- development.

AB  - We have studied the dynamics of non-colloidal short fiber suspensions in bounded shear flow using the Stokesian dynamics simulation. Such particles make up the microstructure of many suspensions for which the macroscopic dynamics are not well understood. The effect of wall on the fiber dynamics is the main focus of this work. For a single fiber undergoing simple shear flow between plane parallel walls the period of rotation was compared with the Jeffrey's orbit. A fiber placed close to the wall shows significant deviation from Jeffrey's orbit. The fiber moving near a solid wall in bounded shear flow follows a pole-vaulting motion, and its centroid location from the wall is also periodic. Simulations were also carried out to study the effect of fiber-fiber interactions on the viscosity of concentrated suspensions. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.

AB  - Evaporating shear driven liquid wall films play an important role in the fuel preparation process of advanced gas turbine combustion chambers. In extending earlier studies of Sill, K.H., 1980. Sammelband der VGB-Tagung, May 1980, pp 232-238 and Himmelsbach, J., Noll, B., Wittig, S., 1994. Int. Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer 37, 1217-1226, the present analysis of shear driven liquid films in a rectangular model duct is directed into the boundary layer flow at the gas-liquid interface and the wall film itself. The experimental conditons range from 314 to 373 K at atmospheric pressure giving duct flow Reynolds numbers of 81 000-162 000. The liquid mass flux for the film is varied between 33.3 g/sm and 100 g/sm. The experimental analysis includes spatially resolved measurements of interfacial shear stress, gas phase velocity and temperature, profiles as well as the wall conditions. The film itself is investigated regarding its thickness and evaporation behaviour. Finally, a reference data set for comparison with CFD-data is obtained. The results obtained suggest that the theoretical models which are currently in use should be modified with regard to the interfacial shear stress development in the axial direction.

Local values of the pressure gradient, film thickness, wall shear stress, film flow rate, disturbance wave velocity and frequency were measured over a range of gas and liquid flow rates. The results show that rapid changes in the film flow parameters occur within the first 50 tube diameters or so from the inlet. Entrained fraction and the film thickness appear to be the slowest to respond and these may take 100 to 300 tube diameters to develop fully. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

As such, they operate with a conception of information that brackets its meaning, while allowing "information as meaning" to remain as an unspoken background that seeps into its discourse. An analysis of information science and economics will show that "information" is defined as nonsemantic discrete bits flowing across space and then directed and stored. This substantiates information as the object of control.

AB  - Electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) flows are investigated theoretically and numerically in this paper and results are presented for the flow field in model electrostatic precipitators (EPs). The resulting flow fields are shown in various representations and explained qualitatively. Numerical calculations with different flow models (non-turbulent and RANS) were conducted to investigate the influence of the flow model on the resulting secondary flows. Furthermore, a perturbation analysis is presented, leading to a simple differential equation of the Helmholtz type. This allows a more detailed view of the important mechanisms forming the secondary flows as well as being able to obtain a very fast estimation of the resulting flow field. The calculations reveal a strong influence of a vortex formation at the beginning of the precipitation zone on the whole flow field. Furthermore, a strong effect of the boundary conditions of the electric field and the operating parameters is shown.

AB  - In this paper the results of flow control experiments utilizing single dielectric barrier discharge plasma actuators to control flow separation and unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder in cross-flow are reported. This work is motivated by the need to reduce landing gear noise for commercial transport aircraft via an effective streamlining created by the actuators. The experiments are performed at ReD = 33,000. Using either steady or unsteady actuation, Karman shedding is totally eliminated, turbulence levels in the wake decrease significantly and near-field sound pressure levels are reduced by 13.3 dB. Unsteady actuation at an excitation frequency of StD = 1 is found to be most effective. The unsteady actuation also has the advantage that total suppression of shedding is achieved for a duty cycle of only 25.

It begins with a brief consideration of the main factors that have driven urban policy over the last 15 yr and the particular role played by Urban Development Corporations (UDCs) as the policy flagship of the era. We then examine the effect that the UDCs have had on urban policy development during the 1980s and the 1990s, what trends they have initiated or intensified and what pressures they have responded to. In the third section we are concerned with the perspectives on the UDCs, the way in which the UDC story is now being told. Examines the continuity and discontinuities that prevail in current urban policy. Questions how the role of UDCs has changed, particularly in the light of City Challenge as the new flagship. Finishes by analysing the extent to which City Challenge and the Urban Regeneration Agency in particular as well as other policy vehicles are capable of meeting the enduring problems of urban policy. -from Authors

AB  - New results of experimental investigation accounted for the parametric effects of the bubble size and the two-phase flow rates on the wall shear stress are reported. The mean and the time-varying fluctuation properties of the wall shear stress are measured based on a flush-mounted hot film sensor for air-water bubbly flow in a vertical channel. The unique feature of this study is that the experiments were carried out under various fixed gas and liquid fluxes, with only the bubble size being changed at the flow entrance. This has been made by using a special bubble generator to decouple the bubble size effect from the inlet condition. The test conditions cover both the wall and core peaking void distributions of bubbly two-phase flow. It is found that the wall shear stress is strongly influenced by the internal and wall proximity structure of the flow, while both the liquid phase velocity and the wall concentrated bubbles are the dominant parameters on both the magnitude and the fluctuation intensity of the wall shear stress in the regime of bubbly flow. The present data are extensively compared with some other data sources and with the models used in predicting the wall shear stress. Due to no obvious existing wall shear stress data and models were accounted for the change in bubble size systematically, the present data thus may serve as a relatively complete comparative basis for the development of theoretical models.

AB  - SummaryThe accumulation and survival of microorganisms attached to a solid surface, is dependent on the physical characteristics of the system in which they exist, including fluid flow, mass transfer and to a lesser extent heat transfer. The conditions relating to the flow of water across a surface, particularly the velocity of flow and its distribution, have a profound effect on the colonisation of the surface by the microorganisms and the subsequent availability of nutrients. Furthermore the flow of water imposes a drag force on the biofilm with the distinct possibility that at least, some biofilm removal will occur. Mass transfer involves the movement of the microorganisms and nutrient to sustain the biofilm. It depends on the fluid flow conditions and the concentration difference between the bulk water and the biofilm. Since microbial deposits are sensitive to the prevailing temperature, heat transfer to or from a biofilm may influence sustainability.

AB  - Direct numerical simulation is used to study the flow field around an infinitely long circular cylinder rotating in fluid with no outer boundary. Wall shear stresses and normal pressure fluctuations are considered with reference to flat, non-rotating geometries to help identify any flow field differences introduced by Coriolis forces. In the present case, Coriolis forces are experienced only by the turbulence field. The dominant effect is to decrease the streamwise turbulent velocity level relative to the other two components. A consequential effect is that the two components of wall shear stress fluctuations become almost equal and spectra for streamwise and spanwise wall shear stress fluctuations become almost identical. This is a distinctly different behaviour from that of non-rotating flat plate and straight pipe flows. Instantaneous wall shear stress fluctuations indicate a near wall flow structure similar to that of other boundary layers with sweeps and ejections. No flow reversals of wall shear stress are indicated. A good correlation of the wall shear stresses and the turbulent kinetic energy exists for y+ < 10. Budgets of Reynolds normal stress components illustrate the role played by Coriolis forces in the production and redistribution of turbulence energies. Wall pressure fluctuations are found to be of much larger spatial extent than velocity fluctuation scales while the probability density distribution of pressure fluctuations is almost Gaussian but does display a Reynolds number effect for skewness and Kurtosis. The ratio of rms pressure fluctuations to mean streamwise wall shear stress follows closely that for flat plate boundary layer and channel flows. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

With the ball-in-cage valves, the flow in the ascending aorta was predominantly axial and uniform throughout systole, while vortex formation was observed downstream from the ball. With the tilting disc valves, the flow development in the aorta was a function of the orientation of the valves. With the major flow orifice directed toward the commissure between the right and noncoronary cusps, the fluid motion was predominantly in the axial direction through early systole. A vortex developed along the wall of lesser curvature of the aorta with the progression of systole. In early diastole, a well-defined flow reversal was observed along the lesser curvature of the aorta. With the major flow orifice directed toward the left coronary cusp, the fluid motion, although predominantly axial, was not uniform in the ascending aorta. Regions of relative stasis present near the wall of greater curvature subsequently developed into a trapped vortex throughout the cardiac cycle. With the major flow orifice directed more posteriorly, an improved fluid dynamic characteristic was observed, and there was no trapped vortex present near the wall of greater curvature. The flow visualization study in the model human aorta suggests that, from a fluid dynamic point of view, orientation of the major flow orifice of the tilting disc valve toward the wall of lesser curvature is not advisable.

AB  - Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of open-channel flow in the presence of an air-water interface was performed to examine the effects of interface deformation on the turbulence structures. In the water-driven turbulence, flows characterized by either of two Froude numbers (Fr=0.2 and 0.8) were examined and compared. A coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid (CLSVOF) method was employed to track the interface. The air that contacted the water was entrained into the turbulent flow. At high Fr, all turbulent normal stresses on the air side of the interface were high near the sidewall. Moreover, all terms of the Reynolds shear stress were intensified at the mixed-boundary corner on the air side of the interface. Two-point correlations between the streamwise vortex and the velocity fluctuations provided structural information about the near-wall streaky structures and the inner secondary flows in the cross-stream plane. Linear stochastic estimates of the conditionally averaged flow field showed that the inner secondary flow consisted of not only in-plane velocity components but also streamwise velocity components.

AB  - In this paper we propose a new method which might be useful to investigate the flow fields close to vaulted walls with spatial and temporal resolution. This kind of flow visualization is important in the field of biofluid mechanics, since a close relationship is assumed between flow and biological phenomena. This new method is non-invasive, and is also applicable for unsteady flows. It has been used to investigate the steady and the unsteady laminar flow in a rectangular duct, as well as the steady, laminar flow in two different U-shaped ducts, both with a backward facing step, one having a rectangular cross-section, the other a nearly elliptical cross-section. The results concurred well with analytical or numerical solutions.

AB  - The results of helium thermal-hydraulic transients of the UNK
superconducting magnet system are presented. The model is based on the
set of 1-D mass, energy, and momentum conservation equations for helium
flow in the cooling channels and the heat conduction equation for the
wall, subject to appropriate boundary and initial conditions. The mass
and energy transfer between helium in the winding gaps and helium
flowing in the cooling channels is taken into account. Pressure,
temperature, and helium mass flow developments during a quench in the
quench protection unit magnets and in the header were calculated. The
influence of heat and mass transfer between helium trapped within
winding gaps and the helium stream on pressure behavior in the magnet is
analyzed. It has been found that the amount of liquid helium contained
in the winding affects the maximum quench pressure

AB  - Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of two-dimensional laminar flow in the entrance region of wavy wall ducts as obtained from the solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. Design/methodology/approach-The study is undertaken by application of the generalized integral transform technique in the solution of the steady Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow. The streamfunction-only formulation is adopted, and a general filtering solution that adapts to the irregular contour is proposed to enhance the convergence behavior of the eigenfunction expansion. Findings-A few representative cases are considered more closely in order to report some numerical results illustrating the eigenfunction expansions convergence behavior. The product friction factor-Reynolds number is also computed and compared against results from discrete methods available in the literature for different Reynolds numbers and amplitudes of the wavy channel. Research limitations/implications-The proposed methodology is fairly general in the analysis of different channel profiles, though the reported results are limited to the wavy channel configuration. Future work should also extend the analysis to geometries represented in the cylindrical coordinates with longitudinally variable radius. Practical implications-The error-controlled converged results provide reliable benchmark results for the validation of numerical results from computational codes that address the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in irregular geometries. Originality/value-Although the hybrid methodology is already known in the literature, the results here presented are original and further challenges application of the integral transform method in the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations.

AB  - Cluster Analysis is the mathematical study of methods for recognizing natural groups within a class of entities. This is a common type of deï¬nition for the discipline of cluster analysis, and it is unsatis- factory in at least one respect. However, this cause for dissatisfaction must be welcomed, since it points directly to some of the essential questions and problems in cluster analy- sis. These essential aspects will be brieï¬y discussed in this introduction, followed by an account of the main contribution of the thesis, the Markov Cluster Process, a cluster pro- cess designed within the setting of graphs. This setting deï¬nes a relatively young area in cluster analysis referred to as graph clustering, which has connections to the clearly scoped ï¬eld of graph partitioning. Clustering and graph-clustering methods are also studied in the large research area labelled pattern recognition. These disciplines and the applications studied therein form the natural habitat for the Markov Cluster Algorithm. Their relative positions are sketched, anticipating a more thorough topography in the ï¬rst part of this thesis. The Markov Cluster Process (abbreviated MCL process) deï¬nes a sequence of stochastic matrices by alternation of two operators on a generating matrix. It is basically all that is needed for the clustering of graphs, but it is useful to distinguish between the algorithm and the algebraic process employed by the algorithm. The study of mathematical prop- erties thus belongs to the process proper, and aspects such as interpretation and scaling belong to the algorithm or a particular implementation of the algorithm. The second part of this thesis covers the conceptual and theoretical foundation of the Markov Clus- ter (abbreviated MCL) Algorithm and Process. Other proposals for graph clustering are discussed, and several classic mathematical results are presented which are relevant in the broad perspective of graph clustering and graph partitioning, in particular the rela- tionship between graph spectra and connectivity properties. The third part of the thesis is concerned with algorithmic issues such as complexity, scalability, and implementation, and various types of experiments and benchmarks establishing the particular strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm.

AB  - The numerical finite-difference procedure of Gosman et al. (1969) is used to predict the growth of the tangential velocity profile and boundary-layer displacement thickness across an isothermal laminar axial flow through a concentric annulus when the inner cylinder is rotated at speeds which are insufficient to generate Taylor vortices. Solutions are obtained for fully developed and for developing axial flow over the ranges 0.05 <$0.98, 0.0002 < l < 1.0 and 100 < Re < 1700. The axial velocity profile is predicted to be insensitive to core rotation and, if varied, to influence only marginally the development of the tangential velocity profile; this is such that its dimensionless displacement thickness is related to dimensionless axial distance by a power law except near full development and at very low Reynolds number. Predictions at high Re accord extremely well with measurements. Astill's (1964) stability criterion for the onset of vortices in tangential developing flow is accordingly presented afresh in terms of system parameters readily available to the designer.

AB  - In this paper we investigate a subgrid model based on an anisotropic version of the NS-alpha model using a lid-driven cavity flow at a Reynolds number of 10,000. Previously the NS-alpha model has only been used numerically in the isotropic form. The subgrid model is developed from the Eulerian-averaged anisotropic equations (Holm, Physica D 133:215, 1999). It was found that when alpha (2) was based on the mesh numerical oscillations developed which manifested themselves in the appearance of streamwise vortices and a 'mixing out' of the velocity profile. This is analogous to the Craik-Leibovich mechanism, with the difference being that the oscillations here are not physical but numerical. The problem could be traced back to the discontinuity in alpha (2) encountered when alpha (2) = 0 on the endwalls. A definition of alpha (2) based on velocity gradients, rather than mesh spacing, is proposed and tested. Using this definition the results with the model show a significant improvement. The splitting of the downstream wall jet, rms and shear stress profiles are correctly captured a coarse mesh. The model is shown to predict both positive and negative energy transfer in the jet impingement region, in qualitative agreement with DNS results.

In line with the current trend toward the use of computationally efficient numerical methods, the present study is based on the use of a three-dimensional parabolic, boundary-layer model and the FLARE approximation. Physical situations investigated include cases with various asymmetric heating conditions over wide ranges of parameters. Analytical solutions for the fully developed flows are also presented, and the criteria for the flow reversal to occur are predicted. Solutions for the developing flow obtained in this study agree closely with the elliptic-model solutions, and precisely approch the fully developed solutions downstream.

AB  - A series of physical experiments, together with Large Eddy Simulations (LES), are performed for an open channel flow over a mildly sloping pool-riffle sequence, a bed morphology typical in many coarse-grained rivers. Five low angled (7.2Â°) bedforms were placed in a 0.6m wide rectangular flume with a flow Reynolds number of approximately Re=20,000. Our broad goal is to develop a general model of flow over this simplified macroscale bedform. Specific objectives were to measure changes to the three-dimensional distribution of flow and describe turbulent shear zones that form due to pressure gradients and interactions with the side wall. A new parameter, Î¨, is introduced to describe the lateral distribution of flow. Flow over the bedforms is characterized by a three-dimensional redistribution of flow and increased generation of turbulence in zones of flow deceleration, particularly near the side walls of the channel. Over repeated bedforms, the distribution of flow and turbulence adjust towards a type of equilibrium characterized by stronger lateral gradients in velocity and Reynolds stress.

AB  - Flow methods have been consolidated as routine techniques of analysis, allowing a high degree of automation and leading to the concept of the total analytical approach, thanks to the ease they provide for integration of all steps of the analytical procedure, from sample collection to acquisition and processing of signals, on a single setup. The huge effort on research and development for monitoring of key indicators and surrogates has delivered a broad spectrum of operational and cost-effective methodologies based on flow analysis for the determination of many environmental parameters. This chapter gives an overview of online monitoring and environmental applications using flow-based methodologies. Their potential in this field is illustrated through representative examples covering a wide range of parameters and sample matrices, e.g. natural and wastewaters, gaseous compounds and atmospheric aerosols, soils, solid wastes and leachates, foodstuff, and plant extracts.

AB  - Three conservation laws â mass, momentum, and energy â are used to describe open-channel flows. Two flow variables, such as the flow depth and velocity, or the flow depth and rate of discharge, are sufficient to define the flow conditions at a channel cross section. Therefore, two governing equations may be used to analyze a typical flow situation. The continuity equation and the momentum or energy equation are used for this purpose. Except for the velocity head coefficient, Î±, and the momentum coefficient, Î², the momentum and energy equations are equivalent [Cunge, et al., 1980] provided the flow depth and velocity are continuous, i.e., there are no discontinuities, such as a jump or a bore. However, the momentum equation should be used if the flow has discontinuities, since, unlike the energy equation, it is not necessary to know the amount of losses in the discontinuities in the application of the momentum equation. In this chapter, we will derive the continuity and momentum equations, usually referred to as de Saint Venant equations. Several investigators [Stoker, 1957; Chow, 1959; Dronkers, 1964; Henderson, 1966; Strelkoff, 1969; Yen, 1973; Liggett, 1975; Cunge, et al., 1980; Lai, 1986; and Abbott and Basco, 1990] derived these equations by using different procedures. For illustration purposes, we will use two different procedures in our derivations. We will use the Reynolds transport theorem for the prismatic channels having lateral inflows or outflows. The type of the governing equations is then discussed. The equations describing flows having non-hydrostatic pressure distribution are derived by integrating the continuity and momentum equations for twodimensional flows. The chapter concludes by presenting integral forms of the governing equations.

RNG turbulence parameterization were implemented in the RAMS model. The first one is commonly used in urban environments, however it was found to have some deficiencies when applied to the simulation of flow impingement and separation. The second parameterization is found to overcome these deficiencies. Results show that the flow that develops around the buildings simulated in the present work is notably complex and was found to be sensitive both to the turbulence closure scheme and to the boundary conditions as specified at the buildings' walls. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the processing of particulate materials in rotary kilns and driers the transverse motion generated in the bed is the primary factor controling renewal of material at the exposed bed surrace. The rate of surface renewal, in turn, determines the degree of material mixing and the rate of heat transfer from the freeboard to the bed. An experimental campaign launched to investigate granular flow behaviour in a transverse plane of a rotary cylinder suggests that a continuum model based on the constitutive equations developed for gravity flow in chutes may be adopted, in some particular cases, to describe flow in the shear (active) layer. A model is developed in which the dimensions of the shear layer, the region near the free surface, is assumed thin thereby permitting the governing equations to reduce to Prandtl's boundary layer equations which are solved to obtain the depth and velocity profiles within the layer. Because the density at the free surface is discontinuous for the flow regimes of practical interest, the continuum assumption breaks down at the free surface, hence, a stress-free boundary ocndition has been avoided. In place of this, a surface velocity constraint from the experimental campaign has been applied which, therefore, makes the model deficient in exploring the full potential of the boundary layer analogy. Nevertheless, the appropriate velocity trends are predicted well into the bed with the results comparing favorably with experimental data.

AB  - The wall-bounded shear flow and the plane Poiseuille channel flow of monodisperse suspensions of liquid drops are considered by theory and numerical simulation. First, the motion of an individual drop in infinite or semi-infinite shear flow is discussed in the limit of small volume fractions. An expression for the flux of the drops normal to the streamlines of the unperturbed flow is derived in terms of (a) the migration velocity of the drop away from the wall, and (b) the net displacement of a drop's center after interception with another drop. In the case of two-dimensional infinite shear flow, in the limit of infinite dilution, and in the context of Stokes flow, the self- and gradient-diffusivity are found to diverge, and this underlines the importance of fluid inertia and the necessity to perform renormalization by requiring global constraints. Numerical simulations of pairwise drop interceptions in semi-infinite shear flow above a plane wall reveal that the capillary number, expressing the drop deformability, and the distance of the drop pair from the wall, play an important role in determining not only the magnitude, but also the direction of the net displacement of the drop center after recession. Dynamic simulations of the expansion of a periodic bed of drops distributed randomly within a layer next to a wall illustrate explicitly the formation of a particle-free zone near the wall and the thickening of the bed due to hydrodynamic interceptions at a rate that is a strong function of the capillary number. Results of dynamic simulations of the pressure-driven flow of a two-dimensional suspension in a channel confined between two parallel walls are presented illustrating the effect of the capillary number and of the ratio of the viscosity of the drop and suspending fluid on (a) the time required for the suspension to reach statistical equilibrium, (b) the distribution of the drop number density across the channel width, (c) the mean velocity profile, and (d) the effective viscosity of the suspension. The general features of the flow are found to be in good agreement with published laboratory observations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a laminar separation bubble in the presence of oscillating flow is performed. The oscillating flow induces a streamwise pressure gradient varying in time. The special shape of the upper boundary of the computational domain, together with the oscillating pressure gradient causes the boundary layer flow to alternately separate and re-attach. When the inflow decelerates, the shear layer starts to separate and rolls up. Simultaneously the flow becomes 3D. After a transient period, the phase-averaged reverse flow inside the separation bubble reaches speeds ranging from 20 up to 150\% of the free-stream velocity. During these phases, the flow is absolutely unstable and self-sustained turbulence can exist. When the inflow starts to accelerate, a spanwise roll of turbulent flow is shed from the shear layer. Shortly after this, the remainder of the separation bubble moves downstream and rejoins with the shed turbulent roll. During the flow-acceleration phase, a patch of laminar boundary layer flow is obtained. Along the flat plate, a series of turbulent patches of flow travelling downstream, separated by laminar flow can be observed, reminiscent of boundary layer flow in a turbine cascade with periodically appearing free-stream disturbances.

AB  - The main source of flow unsteadiness in turbomachinery is the aerodynamical interaction of the rotor and stator blade rows. The blades and vanes, moving relatively to each other, interact because of the viscous wakes and the potential effects of the blades. In addition, the wakes and potential effects superimpose with other flow patterns, for instance the tip clearance vortices and other secondary flow phenomena. Furthermore in transonic compressors the interaction of wakes and shocks plays an important role. As a result, the real flow field is highly periodically unsteady and very complex, especially in multistage turbomachinery. Although this fact has received increasing attention within recent years, blade row interactions effects are not yet typically addressed in current design systems of turbomachinery. Actually, there is a requirement of the ability of modern design methods to predict unsteady flow features. With increasing aerodynamic loading of the blades and higher Mach numbers the consideration of rotor-stator-interactions gains in importance. It is therefore one of the challenges of the present and future design of compressors and turbines to include beneficial unsteady effects to improve the engine parameters. This requires a detailed physical understanding of the unsteady flow field and the resulting effects on the performance and flow stability. In 2000 the joint research program "Periodical Unsteady Flow in Turbomachinery" was initiated. Partners of this project are five research groups from four german universities: Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (Prof. Hourmouziadis), UniversitÃ¤t der Bundeswehr MÃ¼nchen (Prof. Fottner, Prof. Pfitzner), UniversitÃ¤t Karlsruhe: Institut fÃ¼r Thermische StrÃ¶mungsmaschinen (Prof. Wittig, Dr. Dullenkopf), Institut fÃ¼r Hydromechanik (Prof. Rodi), Technische UniversitÃ¤t Dresden (Prof. Vogeler), and a research group from the: German Aerospace Centre (Deutsches Zentrum fÃ¼r Luft- und Raumfahrt), (Prof. Weyer, Prof. MÃ¶nig). This 5-year program was funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and coordinated by Professor Hourmouziadis (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin). The aim of this joint project is to contribute to an improved physical understanding of the periodical unsteady flow phenomena and to provide more reliable prediction methods of these complex flow conditions in turbomachinery. Selected aspects of flow unsteadiness in turbomachines were investigated with complementing experimental and numerical investigations. Different flow conditions of different complexity were investigated in detail. After a 3-year period of the project, first results of the research group are published in a special issue of the Journal of Flow, Turbulence and Combustion (Flow Turbulence Combust 69, 2002). After the end of the joint project, in the present paper selected results of each research group, which addresses different aspects of periodical unsteady flow in turbomachinery, are discussed. However, it is not the intention of the present paper to give a general survey on this field of research. The following topics are selected to provide insight into the work of the joint research group: (1) Experimental Investigation of Rotor-Stator-Interactions in an Axial Compressor, (2) Influence Of Periodically Unsteady Flow On The Boundary Layer Development Of A Highly Loaded Linear Turbine- And Compressor Cascade, (3) Flow Conditions on a Flat Plate under Oscillating Inlet Conditions, (4) Simultaneous Measurements of Flow and Heat Transfer in a Periodically Unsteady Flow, (5) Turbulence- and Transition Modelling for Unsteady RANS simulations, and (6) Direct Numerical Simulations of Transitional Flow in Turbine-Related Geometries.

AB  - We extend fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to systems that undergo translation or laminar flow in a sample cell. We include theoretical and experimental results; we consider uniform and nonuniform velocity profiles. Concentration correlation analysis extracts mi- croscopic rate parameters from measurements of the spontaneous concentration fluctuations, which occur even at equilibrium. Fluorescence is one of the most sensitive means of moni- toring these fluctuations. Analysis of flowing or translating systems (1) offers a method of measuring number concentrations of selected species, for example, of aggregates or polymers, (2) provides a nonperturbing velocity probe, (3) sometimes allows one to circumvent photolytic degradation, (4) has proved extremely helpful in testing and aligning apparatus for fluores- cence correlation measurements and in verifying theoretical analyses, and (5) may be required for interpretation of results obtained on systems in motion, even though that motion is un- desired or initially unsuspected. We include both theoretical and experimental results for combined Poiseuille flow and diffusion in the geometry which is of most practical interest. Theoretical expressions for the much simpler cases of nondiffusive Poiseuille flow as well as uniform flow or translation with or without diffusion constitute limiting cases which are displayed explicitly.

AB  - Swirl flow has applications in many of the engineering equipments. Good amount of calculations exist which have been developed for design of propellers. However, swirler design for combustion applications is different from that for propeller applications. In the former swirl flow is generated by the application of tangential component to the axial flow whereas in the latter swirl is generated by the rotating propellers. Therefore it comes under the category of rotating flows. Quite a few studies have been carried out on vane generated swirl flows over the past four decades. Majority of the studies were based on experiments. Over the last one decade, attention has been focused on the numerical predictions. Due to the advent of fast digital computers, nowadays the CFD studies are becoming the part of the design methodologies. This study mainly focuses attention on arriving at best vane angle from aerodynamic aspects for the combustion applications. As there are large number of flow and geometric parameters involved arriving at the best design by experimental methods is rather difficult compared to CFD analyses. The important geometric parameters are vane angle, vane numbers and hub to tip ratio. The flow parameter involves the selection of appropriate turbulence model for the prediction. The uniqueness of this study is in arriving at the best vane angle using appropriate turbulence models for both weak and strong swirl. To this end experimental and numerical studies have been carried out. It is found that no single turbulence model is able to handle both weak and strong swirl. From this study it is concluded that for weak swirl standard k - ?? model is sufficient whereas for strong swirl one has to resort to Reynolds stress model. The characteristics of swirl flow are evaluated by means of size of the recirculation zone, mass trapped in the recirculation zone and also the pressure drop. Over the range of vane angle investigated the best vane angle is found to be 45??. ?? 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - A three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of passive heat transfer in a Laminar Separation Bubble (LSB) over a flat plate affected by oscillating external flow is presented. The oscillation imposes a periodicity which is employed for phase-averaging. The flat plate is kept at a uniform, low temperature. The local Nusselt number, Nu, is determined as a function of phase. In the dead-air region of the bubble Nu is found to be relatively small, while it peaks in the recirculation region where hot outer fluid gets entrained and is transported towards the flat plate. Each period a new separation bubble is formed, that merges with the old separation bubble. The reverse flow inside the separation bubble reaches values of up to 60% of the local free-stream velocity, which is sufficient to make the separation bubble absolutely unstable such that self-sustained turbulence can exist. For the phase-averaged flow, neither the turbulent viscosity hypothesis nor the temperature gradient-diffusion hypothesis is found to hold. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The lift on a particle that is caused by its proximity to a boundary and the equilibrium position of this particle in a linear shear flow have been studied using the lattice Boltzmann method. The shear particle Reynolds numbers examined were in the range 0-18 and the particle to fluid density ratios were in the range 1.005-1.1. We have found that heavy particles will deposit at the bottom of the channel, while lighter particles remain suspended and attain an equilibrium vertical position, which is characterized by the equality of the lift and the gravity forces. At this equilibrium distance from the boundary, the vertical velocity component is zero, while the horizontal and rotational velocities of the particle are finite. For circular particles, we have found out that the equilibrium position is independent of the initial height of release of the particles and depends only on the density ratio of particle to fluid and the shear Reynolds number. The particle equilibrium positions for the linear shear flow are compared with those computed for Poiseuille flow conditions. Based on the numerical simulation results, a correlation has been derived between the particle-fluid density ratio and the critical particle Reynolds numbers needed to lift the particles. The effects of particle rotation and shape on the equilibrium position have also been studied by simulating the motion of rectangular particles. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular he highlights the references by UDCs to "community involvement' and even the LDDC are providing a community line in recognizing the "lasting regeneration will only be achieved by improving the quality of life for everyone who lives and works in Docklands'. He argues that it remains akin to American-style growth coalitions, bringing together partnerships which solely comprise development elites. In this sense, he is pessimistic about the future of local authority involvement in urban regeneration, predicting their retention of a facilitative role but with little or no control over the regeneration process. -from Editors

AB  - The flow development in the model human aorta with uniform entry as well as with centrally occluding valves mounted at the root of the aorta was described in Part I of this two-paper sequence. Part II deals with the flow development in the model aorta with tilting disc valves mounted at the root of the aorta. Bjork-Shiley and Hall-Kaster tilting disc valves were mounted in three different orientations with respect to the root of the aorta. The velocity profiles and turbulent stresses were measured with laser-Doppler anemometry. Our results under steady flow conditions in the model human aorta show quantitatively that the flow development in the ascending aorta as well as in the brachio-cephalic artery are strongly dependent on the orientation of the tilting disc valves.

AB  - Steady laminar flows in coiled annular ducts are investigated numerically. Numerical solutions are obtained by solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with a SIMPLE type procedure for annular curved ducts of various radius ratio for a given Reynolds number. Effect of radius ratio on the flow development is given particular attention. Computational results indicate that the secondary flow in a half cross section (above or below the line of symmetry) for the case of moderate radius ratio is characterized by a pair of counter-rotating vortices; the flow in the core region is toward the outside bend and the flow near the inner and outer walls is toward the inside bend. However, when the radius ratio is very large, say greater than 0.8, the secondary flow is undirectional and is toward the inside bend, owing to the strong viscous effect. It is also found that the downstream flow development is greatly affected by the radius ratio. When the radius ratio is moderate, the centroid of the first moment of streamwise velocity lies on the outside half plane; when the radius ratio is very large, the centroid lies on the inside half plane. In contrast to the case of straight annular duct, the flow in a curved annular duct is not necessarily fully developed earlier when the radius ratio is larger owing to the complicated interaction between the viscous and the centrifugal forces.

AB  - The effect of velocity shear on the stability of resistive wall modes driven by a plasma flow is studied numerically in a slab model. It is shown that the sheared plasma flow can suppress the resistive wall instability if the velocity shear exceeds a critical value when a certain central velocity of the flow is lower than the AlfvÃ©n velocity. In comparison with the critical velocities in the uniform velocity case, it is found that the critical velocities of the sheared flow are always bigger than the former. Therefore the velocity shear is a stabilizing factor to the plasma flow driven resistive wall instability when the central velocity of the flow is lower than the AlfvÃ©n velocity.

AB  - For a quantitative calculation of a flow spectrum from the Doppler frequencies the velocity, the irradiation, and scattering directions must be well known. With the assumption of a random distribution of the velocity and irradiation a realistic flow spectrum can be calculated. Furthermore, the flow spectrum depends on the scattering phase function of the moving particles. A flow meter was developed, consisting of a PC and a control card for two Doppler sensors to be fixed on skin. A Pascal program shows the flows on the display with resolution in time >50 Hz. Four different how domains can be shown simultaneously and the frequency span can be set independently. mows corresponding to low and high Doppler frequencies are different and provide the possibility to distinguish between the flow in the micro capillaries and larger vessels.

AB  - In many forming processes the polymer melt undergoes predominantly extensional deformation, for example in blow moulding and film blowing. Furthermore, the extensional flow behaviour of melts differs significantly from their shear flow behaviour. Thus extensional flow measurement methods are necessary to characterise most appropriately the melt behaviour. Such data can be used for the development and selection of materials and for improving processing. There are two basic approaches to determining extensional flow properties of polymer melts: either using tensile testing methods or converging flow methods. Tensile testing methods were reviewed and their use reported elsewhere [1,2]. The converging flow approach for determining the extensional flow behaviour of polymer melts is based on the measurement of the resistance to flow in a contraction geometry. A converging flow is, by definition, a type of extensional flow. It is expected therefore that extensional viscosity might be obtained from the measurement of pressure drop and flow rate in a converging flow. The approach of using converging flow methods is appealing as experimental data are easily obtained from capillary extrusion rheometry tests that are normally carried out to determine the shear viscosity of materials. Thus extensional viscosity values can be obtained from the same capillary rheometry tests that are carried out to determine shear viscosity at little or no extra cost. This measurement note summarises work carried out on the use of converging flow models for determining extensional viscosity data. A comparison of the predictions of selected converging flow models is presented. Also, a comparison of the predictions of the Cogswell converging flow model with data obtained using a tensile method is presented to demonstrate the validity of the converging flow approach.

AB  - This chapter describes the principal flow phenomena, and develops and presents methods to determine parameters such as the drag associated with a rotating cylinder and local flow velocities. The flow phenomenon in rotating cylinder applications depends on the orientation of the cylinder to the flow and the axis of rotation. Correlations are available to determine the drag associated with rotating shaft applications. For an annulus where the inner or outer cylinder may be rotating, consideration can be given to the stability of the flow in order to identify whether vortices are likely to form. Under certain conditions of inner cylinder rotation or combined inner and outer cylinder rotation, toroidal vortices can form in an annulus known as Taylor vortices, with alternate vortices rotating in opposite directions. Rotation of a cylinder or sphere in a cross-flow causes a deflection of the fluid stream and as a result a force due to reaction on the cylinder or sphere concerned. This phenomenon can be exploited to provide a propulsive mechanism for ships and boats using winds to provide the cross-flow; in sports, the variability in lift and drag with spin rate is exploited to control the trajectory and bounce of a shot and in some cases to provide ball or projectile flight paths that are more difficult to predict.

AB  - Measurements of wall shear stress of turbulent boundary layers in the channel flow were carried out using a micro-electromechanical-system (MEMS)-based micro-shear stress imaging chip. The study was carried out in a turbulent channel flow facility. One array of 25 micro-shear stress sensors in the chip that covers a length of 7.5 mm is used to measure the instantaneous span-wise distribution of the surface shear stress. The characteristics of high shear stress area (streaks) were described with statistics. Based on the measurement, the physical quantities associated with the high shear stress streaks, such as their length, width with the high shear stress level, were obtained. To further explore the relationship between the shear stress slope and the peak shear stress, the probability density function (PDF) of the ratio of peak shear stress to shear stress slope at different Reynolds number Re is examined. As for the distribution of PDF, it was found that the distribution concentrated towards a certain value in each Re. This result is extremely important because it points to the possibility of predicting the peak shear stress level based on the shear stress distribution at the leading edge of the streaks.

AB  - The urban proportion of China's population is forecast to increase from 30.2% (319 million) in 1995 to 49.1% (711.7 million) in 2020. During the same period car ownership in cities is forecast to increase by 1,000%, i.e. ten times more. Urban traffic congestion is becoming rapidly worse. It is already a major constraint on urban productivity and sustainability and it is impeding improvement in the quality of life. Most urbanised cities have experienced serious traffic congestion. In some large cities, the duration of congestion, the size of congested areas and their number are on the rise. Vehicular air and noise pollution is increasing, contributing significantly to greenhouse gases (GHG) and global warming and posing a serious health threat to urban populations. Urban transport energy consumption has been growing steadily. Shares of traditional NMT (non motorised transport) modes, especially bicycle transport, are decreasing in response to both longer travel distances (brought about by an unprecedented urbanisation and urban sprawl pattern) and problems inherent in sharing road space with more cars. Much of the erstwhile NMT traffic is presently shifting to public transport modes, predominantly the bus. However, public transport services are poor in many cities. The development of public transport is often hindered by a lack of capacity, slow operating speeds, outdated equipment and outdated management practices. Urban commuters have been experiencing longer traveling times by using the bus. Â© 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

We describe here the build-up of an experimental set-up designed to investigate the critical coalescence conditions in the case of two free water droplets in an oil shear flow under the action of an applied electric field. Drop pairs will be injected in a Poiseuille flow to study, by optical means, their relative motion, deformation and possible coalescence. Important part of this preliminary work concerns the injection of controlled charge free drop pairs using a newly developed EHD actuation technique.

AB  - Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by 133Xe clearance simultaneously with the velocity of blood flow through the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) over a wide range of arterial PCO2 in eight normal men. Average arterial PCO2, which was varied by giving 4% and 6% CO2 in O2 and by controlled hyperventilation on O2, ranged from 25.3 to 49.9 mm Hg. Corresponding average values of global CBF15 were 27.2 and 65.0 ml 100 g min-1, respectively, whereas MCA blood-flow velocity ranged from 42.8 to 94.2 cm/s. The relationship of CBF to MCA blood-flow velocity over the imposed range of arterial PCO2 was described analytically by a parabola with the equation: CBF = 22.8 - 0.17 x velocity + 0.006 x velocity2 The observed data indicate that MCA blood-flow velocity is a useful index of CBF response to change in arterial PCO2 during O2 breathing at rest. With respect to baseline values measured while breathing 100% O2 spontaneously, percent changes in velocity were significantly smaller than corresponding percent changes in CBF at increased levels of arterial PCO2 and larger than CBF changes at the lower arterial PCO2. These observed relative changes are consistent with MCA vasodilation at the site of measurement during exposure to progressive hypercapnia and also during extreme hyperventilation hypocapnia.

AB  - A numerical simulation of a square jet ejected transversely into a laminar boundary-layer flow was performed at a jet-to-main-flow velocity ratio of 9.78 and jet Reynolds number of 6330. The jet consisted of a single pulse with a duration equal to the time required for the jet fluid to travel 173 jet widths. A strongly-favourable streamwise pressure gradient was applied to the boundary layer and produced a freestream acceleration that is above the typical threshold required for relaminarization. The results of the simulation illustrate the effect of the favourable streamwise pressure gradient on the flowfield created by the transverse jet. Notably, the horseshoe vortex system created upwind of the jet remains steady in time and does not induce noticeable fluctuations in the jet flow. The upwind and downwind shear layers of the jet roll-up through a Kelvin-Helmholtz-like instability into discrete shear-layer vortices. Jet vorticity in the upwind and downwind shear layers accumulates near the corners of the jet and produces two sets of vortex pairs, the former of which couple with the shear-layer vortices to produce large, counter-rotating vortices in the freestream, while the latter are unstable and periodically produce hairpin vortices in the main-flow boundary layer and elongated vortices in the freestream behind the jet. The departure of the jet flowfield from the vortical structures typically observed in transverse jets illustrates the substantive effect of the favourable streamwise pressure gradient on the flowfield created by the jet.

AB  - We investigate two different discretization approaches of a model optimal-control problem, chosen to be relevant for control of instabilities in shear flows. In the first method, a fully discrete approach has been used, together with a finite-element spatial discretization, to obtain the objective function gradient in terms of a discretely-derived adjoint equation. In the second method, Chebyshev collocation is used for spatial discretization, and the gradient is approximated by discretizing the continuously-derived adjoint equation. The discrete approach always results in a faster convergence of the conjugate-gradient optimization algorithm. Due to the shear in the convective velocity, a low diffusivity in the problem complicates the structure of the computed optimal control, resulting in particularly noticeable differences in convergence rate between the methods. When the diffusivity is higher, the control becomes less complicated, and the difference in convergence rate reduces. The use of approximate gradients results in a higher sensitivity to the degrees of freedom in time. When the system contains a strong instability, it only takes a few iteration to obtain an effective control for both methods,even if there are differences in the formal convergence rate. This indicates that it is possible to use the approximative gradients of the objective function in cases where the control problem mainly consists of controlling strong instabilities.

AB  - The laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid is considered through a prototype radial entrance geometry that consists of a circular pipe joined to the bottom plate of a pair of parallel circular plates, a configuration that mimics and idealizes important practical flows. The equations of motion are solved numerically to compute the velocity field as a function of the Reynolds number Re and the geometrical aspect ratio e. This work extends limited previous results on flow development in this entrance geometry. A range of e and Re are considered, and the Reâe parameter space corresponding to flow separation is delineated. The computed results are used to illustrate the role of the aspect ratio in influencing flow development for small eâ²1 and are analyzed to quantify the large e asymptotic behavior of various quantities characterizing the developing flow field. The limiting value of aspect ratio beyond which the asymptotic behavior applies is relatively small eâ³2. The dependence of these quantities on Re also is analyzed. The results are discussed in light of available experimental measurements and existing analytical results. An important implication of the results in the context of confined laminar impinging jet heat transfer is described. The entrance configuration is contrasted with a companion radial entrance flow (radial source flow); although flow separation occurs in both cases, some basic features are quite distinct. The influence of the elongational character of this radial flow field is highlighted by comparing certain aspects of flow development between this axisymmetric configuration and its 2-D Cartesian analog.

Cross-section analyses at certain time periods for capturing "long-run" effects as well as time-series analyses for some countries for "short-run" effects were done taking advantage of the "rectangular" array of data. There were several interesting results: the pattern of unemployment rate in most developing countries shows an inverted-U shaped curve with respect to the degree of urbanization; the pattern of urban concentration is in the form of an inverted-U with respect to the economic development level; and the degree of inequality of income distribution seems to react in an inverted-U form to the variances in the extent of urbanization.

AB  - This paper presents a cohesive study of flowin a jet-driven vortex chamber for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, contraction ratios, inlet angles, areas, and aspect ratios. Dimensional analysis furnishes the general functional relationships between the fundamental dimensionless quantities.Application of the integral equations of continuity and energy over the control volume, along with the minimum-pressure-drop or maximum-flow-rate postulate, provide the required analytical means to relate the predominant nondimensional parameters such as the chamber geometry, core size, pressure drop, Reynolds number, and viscous losses. The theoretical results successfully capture most of the salient properties of the flow. A parametric examination explores how the pressure coefficient and the core size vary with the different dimensionless properties. The observations show the pressure drop to decrease with the length. At first this appears to be counterintuitive since one habitually expects the pressure drop to be larger for longer pipes. A closer consideration, however, reveals that in addition to the radialaxial plane flow there is also a substantial centrifugal force, which decays with the length, thus shaping the development of the overall flowfield. Last, the current theory confirms that the previous published models are only applicable for high Reynolds numbers where the inertia dominates the viscous forces.

AB  - This article presents comparisons between predictions, obtained during the course of this investigation, and recently produced measurements of the flow development through a square cross-sectioned U-bend of strong curvature, Rc/D = 0.65, that is either stationary or in orthogonal rotation. For the stationary case, four turbulence models have been tested; a high-Re k-Îµ model interfaced with the low-Re 1-equation model in the near-wall regions, a high-Re algebraic second-moment (ASM) closure with the low-Re 1-equation model in the near-wall regions, and two versions of a low-Re ASM model. The two low-Re ASM models return noticeably better predictions of the flow development. There is, however further scope for improvement, especially in the downstream section. Two rotating flow cases have been computed both with the axis of rotation parallel to the axis of bend curvature; one at a positive rotation number Ro â¡ Î©D/Wb of 0.2 and one at Ro â¡ -0.2. In the case of positive rotation, where the Coriolis and curvature forces reinforce each other, the flow predictions of the low-Re ASM are in very close agreement with the data. When the U-bend rotates negatively, the complex flow field generated in the downstream section is not well reproduced by the low-Re ASM model. More refined turbulence models are thus necessary when the curvature and Coriolis forces oppose each other.

AB  - Fully-developed flow in a concentric annulus formed by a stationary outer cylinder, which may be heated isothermally, and a rotatable inner cylinder has been studied experimentally by means of hot-wire anemometry techniques. Velocity profiles for the axial, tangential, and radial directions of flow have been obtained for adiabatic conditions and for wide and narrow annular gaps. It has been shown that the onset of Taylor vortex flow has a pronounced effect on the velocity profiles for all three directions. However, while the profiles for the axial and tangential directions are explicable, those for the radial direction are not so, at present. Also, it was found that heat transfer through the outer annular surface had a greater effect on the radial velocity profile than on the axial or tangential, but in the narrow gap case only.

AB  - An experimental flow visualization study of the entrance section of channels formed with sinusoidal plates was made. The experiments were conducted in a water tunnel and a laser illuminated particle tracking was used as the technique of flow visualization. The geometric parameters of the plates were maintained constant while the distance between plates, phase angle, and the Reynolds number were varied during the experiments. The flow regimes that were found in the experiments are steady, unsteady and significantly-mixed flows. Instabilities of the flow first appear near the exit of the channel, and move closer to the inlet waves as the Reynolds number grows, but in the first wave from inlet the flow is always steady. The results show that, for all other parameters fixed, the Reynolds number at which unsteady flow first appears grows with the distance between plates. The phase angle that best promotes unsteady flow depends on the average distance between plates: for certain average distance between plates, there is a phase angle that best disturbs the flow. For the set of parameters used in this experiment, a channel with eight waves is sufficiently long and the flow features presented in the first eight waves of a longer channel will be similar to what was observed here.

AB  - Environmental research on aquatic microorganisms, such as phytoplankton, aquatic bacteria, and aquatic viruses, often takes advantage of their natural chlorophyll, phycobilins, and other intrinsic fluorescent pigments. Although epifluorescence microscopy is still used frequently, flow cytometry has become a key research tool due to its ability to provide multiparametric analysis at the single-cell level. Along with the analytical opportunities flow cytometry has brought to the field, aquatic microorganism research poses certain technical challenges as well. These include a large variation in organism size, analysis of unfiltered samples, the generation of complex multiparametric data across a wide dynamic fluorescence range, the need for quantification, and a difficult operational environment. This white paper explores both the opportunities and challenges of aquatic research, and examines how the BD Accuriâ¢ C6 flow cytometer is well suited for this work. The final section of this paper is a âfield guideâ to using the BD Accuri C6 in aquatic microorganism research. It describes how to detect natural fluorophores such as chlorophyll, phycocyanins, and phycoerythrin (PE), and how to use fluorescence profiles to identify cyanobacteria, other autotrophic phytoplankton, and heterotrophic bacteria and viruses. Several examples illustrate the BD Accuri C6 cytometerâs role in ongoing field research in the Great Lakes, the Gulf of Mexico, the Netherlands, and Antarctica.

AB  - The predictive performance of several turbulence models, among them formulations based on non-linear stress-strain relationships and on stress-transport equations, is examined in a collabora- tive university-industry study directed towards a generic wing-body junction. The geometry consists of a variation of the symmetric NACA 0020 aerofoil mounted on a flat plate, with the oncoming stream aligned with the aerofoilâs symmetry plane. The dominant feature of this flow is a pro- nounced horseshoe vortex evolving in the junction region following separation ahead of the aerofoilâs leading edge. This case is one of 6 forming a broad programme of turbulence-model validation by UMIST, Loughborough University, BAE Systems, Aircraft Research Association, Rolls-Royce plc and DERA. Key aspects of this collaboration were a high level of interaction between the partners, the use of common grids and boundary conditions, and numerical verifications aimed at maximising confidence in the validity of the computational solutions. In total, 12 turbulence models were studied by four partners. Model performance is judged by comparing solutions with experimental data for pressure fields on the plane wall and around the aerofoil; for velocity, turbulence energy, shear stress and streamwise normal stress in the upstream symmetry plane; and for velocity, turbulence energy and shear stress in cross-flow planes downstream of the aerofoil leading edge. The emphasis of the study is on the structure of the horseshoe vortex and its effects on the forward flow. The main finding of the study is that, for this particular 3D flow, second-moment closure offers predictive advantages over the othermodels examined, especially in terms of the far-field structure of the horse-shoe vortex, although no model achieves close agreement with the experimental data in respect of bothmean flow and turbulence quantities.

AB  - Void fraction, Taylor bubble and liquid slug lengths, and slug frequency are parameters essential to any description of the structure of slug flow. In the present study, these parameters were extracted from the time series of cross-sectionally averaged void fraction obtained from two vertical facilities having similar internal pipe diameter but significantly different axial lengths; 51.2 mm/3.5 m and 52.3 mm/9 m. In order to study slug flow, the flow rates for which it occurred were first identified. To investigate the effect of flow development on slug characteristics measurements were carried out at several axial locations from the mixing section for both facilities. For slug frequency, a new correlation including the effect of the axial length has been proposed and assessed using previously published data. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The entrance conditions for pulsatile flow are important in the understanding blood flow out of the heart and in developing regions at branches. The pulsatile entrance flow was solved using a spectral element simulation of the full unsteady Navier-Stokes equations. A mean Reynolds number of 200 and a range of Womersley parameters from 1.8 to 12.5 was used for a sinusoidal inlet flow waveform 1 + sin (omega t). Variations in the entrance length were observed during the pulsatile cycle. The amplitude of the entrance length variation decreased with an increase in the Womersley parameter. The phase lag between the entrance length and the inlet flow waveform increased for Womersley parameter alpha up to 5.0 and decreased for alpha larger than 5.0. For low alpha, the maximum entrance length during pulsatile flow was approximately the same as the steady entrance length for the peak flow. For high varies; is directly proportional to, the pulsatile entrance length was more uniform during the cycle and tended to the entrance length for the mean flow. The wall shear rate reached its far downstream value after only about half of the entrance length and also exhibited a dependence on alpha. The results quantify the entrance conditions typically encountered in studies of the arterial system.

AB  - It is a common spoof to use a photograph to fool face recognition algorithm. In light of differences in optical flow fields generated by movements of two-dimensional planes and three-dimensional objects, we proposed a new liveness detection method for face recognition. Under the assumption that the test region is a two-dimensional plane, we can obtain a reference field from the actual optical flow field data. Then the degree of differences between the two fields can be used to distinguish between a three-dimensional face and a two-dimensional photograph. Empirical study shows that the proposed approach is both feasible and effective

AB  - The deposition of particles in fully-developed turbulent channel flow has been calculated using  large eddy simulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Calculations were performed for  Reynolds numbers of 11,160 and 79,400 (based on bulk velocity and hydraulic diameter); subgrid-scale  stresses were parameterized using the dynamic eddy viscosity model. Particle motion was governed by both  drag and lift. The effect of particle-particle interactions as well as modification of the turbulent carrier  flow by the particles was neglected. In agreement with previous studies, LES results show that particles  accumulate in the near-wall region. Statistical measures from the LES calculations such as the particle  deposition rate are in reasonable agreement with the direct numerical simulation results of McLaughlin  (1989). For particles with identical relaxation times in wall units, deposition rates at the two Reynolds  numbers were nearly identical. Issues relevant to application of LES for predicting particle deposition at  high Reynolds numbers are also discussed.

AB  - Despite considerable research on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and conditions associated with unexplained chronic fatigue (CF), little is known about their prevalence and demographic distribution in the population. The present study describes the epidemiology and characteristics of self-reported CF and related conditions in a diverse urban community. The study used a cross-sectional telephone screening survey of households in San Francisco, followed by interviews with fatigued and nonfatigued residents. Respondents who appeared to meet case definition criteria for CFS, based on self-reported fatigue characteristics, symptoms, and medical history, were classified as CFS-like cases. Subjects who reported idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF) that did not meet CFS criteria were classified as ICF-like cases. Screening interviews were completed for 8,004 households, providing fatigue and demographic information for 16,970 residents. Unexplained CF was extremely rare among household residents <18 years of age, but was reported by 2% of adult respondents. A total of 33 adults (0.2% of the study population) were classified as CFS-like cases and 259 (1.8%) as ICF-like cases. Neither condition clustered within households. CFS- and ICF-like illnesses were most prevalent among women and persons with annual household incomes below $40,000, and least prevalent among Asians. The prevalence of CFS-like illness was elevated among African Americans, Native Americans, and persons engaged in clerical occupations. Although CFS-like cases were more severely ill than those with ICF-like illness, a similar symptom pattern was observed in both groups. In conclusion, conditions associated with unexplained CF occur in all sociodemographic groups but appear to be most prevalent among women, persons with lower income, and some racial minorities.

AB  - Poverty dominates the international development agenda of the 21st century. The improvement of the health and living conditions of millions of slum dwellers around the world is a primary concern of the current Millennium Development Goals for reducing poverty. Up to the 1980s poverty was largely associated with the rural areas in developing countries; but the situation has changed with the dramatic increase in the numbers and proportion of the population living in urban areas, and a corresponding increase in the level of urban poverty. The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that the proportion of the urban work force engaged in the informal sector is highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and accounts for more than 50% of urban employment in two-thirds of the countries surveyed in 1999. Irregular settlements also have become so pervasive that they seem to outnumber legally planned development, and their social legitimacy appears to be no longer in question. Unfortunately, the appalling environmental conditions associated with informal sector activities and settlements constitute a major threat to the health and well-being of urban life.

AB  - This experimental investigation deals with transition phenomena of a separated boundary layer under unsteady inlet flow conditions. The main purpose of this investigation is to understand the influence of the rotor-stator interaction in turbomachinery on the subsequent, highly loaded boundary layer. The research project is divided into two phases. In the first phase, which has been completed recently, only the variation of mean velocity caused by upstream blades was simulated in the experiments while the free-stream turbulence intensity was retained at a constant low level. The experiments are carried out in an Eifel-type wind tunnel to investigate the laminar separated boundary layer of a flat plate under oscillating inlet conditions. The adverse pressure gradient, similar to that of turbomachines, is generated by the contoured upper wall. The unsteadiness is produced by a rotating flap located downstream of the test section. The reduced frequency, the amplitude and the mean Reynolds number are varied to simulate the conditions prevailing in turbomachines. In addition to the KelvinâHelmholtz instability of the separated shear layer, a lower frequency instability was observed. This is frequently referred to as âfree shear layer flappingâ and results in two distinctly different ways of re-attachment, depending primarily on the Reynolds number. For low momentum thickness Reynolds numbers at the separation point, large-scale vortices locked to the frequency of the unsteady main flow are identified. They originate nearly at the top of the separation bubble and are ejected downstream. A fully turbulent boundary layer develops after these vortices mix out. For higher Reynolds numbers, transition is completed within a short length of the free shear layer and the re-attachment region. The characteristic momentum thickness Reynolds number separating these two regimes in unsteady flow is about 125. The Strouhal number (reduced frequency) does not appear to have any significant effect. Based on the experimental results, this behaviour is discussed in some detail.

AB  - A new technique is presented for measuring instantaneous flow rates in unsteady laminar duct flows. It is based on a relationship between flow rate and centerline-velocity history that is an exact solution to the Navier-Stokes equations for parallel, fully-developed flow of constant-property Newtonian fluids undergoing arbitrary unsteadiness from an initially steady state. The method applies instantaneously in both forward and reversing flow and invokes the sole additional assumption that the flow is axisymmetric. The capabilities of the technique are demonstrated by using experimental measurements of the centerline velocity in a tube upstream of a fuel injector, during a series of sequential injections, to: (i) quantify the differences in the fuel masses injected in each event; and (ii) measure the cumulative masses injected over multiple events. They were found to be in good agreement with direct measurements made with a mass balance. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gas-particle turbulent channel flow at ReÏ = 644, loaded with copper particles at a mass flow ratio of 2%, is studied numerically by large eddy simulation (LES) coupled with Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). Inter-particle collisions and correction of drag force in the vicinity of walls are accounted for. Focus is made on the influence of particle wall boundary conditions and their influence on the statistical structure of the flow. It is shown that accordance with experimental data can be improved if a mechanism which can suppress the direct re-entrainment of particles after the impact at the wall is present. Present result shows that inter-particle collisions may play an important role in the re-distribution of particle momentum among different components even at low mass loading conditions.

AB  - In this paper the influence of small droplets, with radius 10â8m < r < 10â6 m, on laminar and turbulent boundary layer behavior is considered. It is found that the laminar boundary layer in a two-phase flow with strongly dispersed liquid retains dissipation energy and that the recovery factor of enthalpy is greater than unity. In turbulent boundary layers small droplets are transported by turbulent diffusion and this leads to the recovery factor being less than unity. Its value in both cases depends mainly on the nondimensional number Ds = CLeL/(Ue2/2). The laminar boundary layer solution for non-equilibrium two-phase flow is obtained. Profiles of the droplet mass fraction, vapour and droplets temperatures and droplet radius are computed for the case of a steady two-dimensional flow. The turbulent boundary layer is treated using a semi-empirical theory assuming thermodynamic equilibrium.

AB  - The effect of the free-stream velocity profile on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow on a flat plate was studied experimentally and numerically and it is presented in this paper. The flows investigated are based on the T3L test case of the ERCOFTAC Special Investigation Group for transition. According to this test case, the boundary layer development on a flat plate with a semi-circular leading edge is examined by means of transition due to separation, under various free-stream conditions concerning the turbulence intensity and velocity magnitude. In the present work, two free-stream velocity distributions were studied. The first was a uniform velocity one and the second, with a mean shear velocity profile with positive gradient, ?????/???y = 27.7 s-1. Measurements using hot-wire anemometry were taken in two primary regions: far upstream of the flat plate to observe the velocity and turbulence distributions and near the flat plate to capture the boundary layer development and the transition phenomenon. The effect of the two free-stream velocity distributions was studied and it was shown that for both velocity distributions a recirculation region of the flow occurred near the flat plate wall that led to transition dominated by the boundary layer separation. For the positive velocity gradient the separation region was smaller compared to the case of uniform free-stream profile. Both cases were also studied computationally. Two widely used linear eddy-viscosity turbulence models, the k-?? and the k-?? with specific low Reynolds formulations were applied and in addition, a non-linear eddy-viscosity based on the k-?? model has been implemented. In general, all the k-?? models gave satisfactory predictions for both flow cases regarding the predicted velocity distributions, while the k-?? model gave poor results. Concerning the longitudinal Reynolds stress distributions in the near-wall region, the non-linear k-?? model gave the best predictions inside the separation zone but it over predicted the corresponding values beyond the reattachment point while beyond the separation the linear models predicted the longitudinal stresses in a more satisfactory way. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The influence of riser diameter on the axial and radial solids flux and flow development is studied in three riser circulating fluidized bed reactors of different diameters (76, 100 and 203 mm i.d. risers). A suction probe was used for the direct measurement, while the calculated local solids flux data obtained from solids velocity and concentration measured by two separate fibre optic probes were used to compare. Two shapes were found for the radial profile of the solids flux, a parabolic shape and a flat core shape. The shapes obtained could be predicted, based on the operating conditions, using a new concept of the effective solids saturation carrying capacity. The radial profile of solids flux is less uniform in a larger riser than in a smaller riser. Flow development is slower with the increase of riser diameter. The operating conditions were found to affect the solids flux in each reactor in the same general fashion: increasing gas velocity decreased the amount of downflow solids in the risers; increases in the solids circulation rate caused more solids to flow downwards. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Is it possible to locate sustainability efforts to one part of the city and by creating a spatial imbalance expect that these efforts gradually spread to the rest of the city? For this purpose this paper proposes a model of unbalanced sustainable development. The model is based on an old theory in development economics, namely unbalanced growth. The author contends that such a model should be suitable for many cities where the opportunities for more comprehensive city-wide sustainable development strategies are limited.

AB  - We present experimental results on the mean flow development and potential core lengths of single- and dual. stream compressible air jets. The research is relevant to noise emission. thermal signature, and combustion in high-speed turbulent jets. The primary flow was set at Mach number 1.5, and the secondary stream was supplied at four subsonic Mach numbers from nozzles of variable area and shape. Coaxial and eccentric nozzle configurations were investigated. In the coaxial arrangements, the secondary flow reduces the growth rate of the primary shear layer and elongates the primary potential core. As a result, the mass entrainment rate of the coaxial jet is less than that of the single jet. The potential core is stretched by 68% when a secondary stream with area ratio 2.9 is supplied at Mach number 0.9. The eccentric configuration shows substantial improvement in mixing over the coaxial case and achieves an entrainment rate roughly equal to that of the single jet when the exit areas of the primary and secondary streams are approximately equal. On an equal mass flow rate basis, the eccentric dual-stream jet with area ratio 0.9 actually mixes faster than the single jet. The potential core and the supersonic region of the jet are elongated much less than in the coaxial case. A semi-empirical model, based on the present data and classical shear layer relations, is proposed for the primary and secondary core lengths of coaxial jets.

AB  - The flow development of Herschel-Bulkley fluids in a sudden three-dimensional square expansion is studied numerically. The flow is modeled using the mixed-Galerkin finite element formulation to solve the conservation of mass and momentum equations. The Herschel-Bulkley material behavior is described using a regularized model based on the Papanastasiou model. Solutions are obtained for a downstream-to-upstream expansion ratio of 2:1 and for a wide range of pressure gradient values and rheological parameters. The results show that, during the evolution of the flow, two core regions and dead zones at the corners are formed. The extent of the core regions decreases with the pressure gradient and the Reynolds number, and increases with the power-law index. It is also found that the volume flow rate at steady flow increases with the pressure gradient, power-law index, and Reynolds number. (C) 1999 The Society of Rheology. [S0148-6055(99)02103-3].

AB  - Second-moment closure predictions of developing turbulent flow in a plane channel subjected to rapid spanwise rotation are compared with experimental results. Near-wall effects are modelled by elliptic relaxation. Rapid pressure-strain interactions are accounted for by a non-linear, cubic model which employs variable coefficients and is consistent with the principle of material frame indifference (MFI) in the limit of two-dimensional turbulence. It is shown that the rotational-induced effect of the Coriolis force on the developing mean flow field and the turbulence quantities is well reproduced by the present approach. It is particularly encouraging that the experimentally observed relaminarization on the stabilized suction side of the channel could be predicted well. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - An anisotropic Lagrangian approach is used to investigate the influence of a mean fluid velocity gradient on the motion and on the dispersion of heavy particles suspended in a stationary homogeneous turbulent gas flow. The problem of consistency of the correlation matrices used in first-order stochastic processes is put forward. The accuracy of the method is first checked by comparing the numerical predictions with available experimental results in uniform flow. A second validation test is carried out by comparison with dispersion measurements in a horizontal shear flow. Numerical predictions are then provided in the case of a vertical upward turbulent shear flow, the gravity force field implying a non-zero mean drift velocity between fluid and particles. The transverse particle dispersion is found to be slightly reduced by the presence of a uniform shear. The streamwise particle turbulent intensity is enhanced above the level predicted without shear, whereas, in the direction normal to the flow, the fluctuating velocity of particles are found to be unaffected by the presence of shear. The effect of the lift force due to the mean shear is found to be negligible, except for the mean transverse deviation, which is found however not to be caused only by the lift. The presented numerical results, which confirm and extend the theoretical analysis of others, may explain some experimental observations reported in the literature.

AB  - Numerical calculations of a lifted H2=N2 turbulent jet flame in a vitiated coflow of hot gases are presented. The calculations are per- formed using Magnussen's Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) for tur- bulent combustion, and are an extension to previously reported EDC modeling results presented by Cabra et al. (2002). Four dif ferent tur- bulence models are employed to investigate in more detail the turbu- lence modeling ef fect on the EDC combustion model with detailed chemistry. A series of simulations are presented that indicate the extent to which turbulence models influence the predicted lift-of f height with the EDC combustion model. Several flow conditions were tested. For all calculations, EDC predicts more lift-of f by using the standard k-e model than by using Reynolds-stress-equation (RSE) models, whereas a modified k-e model predicts less lift-of f than the RSE models. The reason for the lower predicted lift-of f with the modified k-e model is because a modified turbulence Prandtl or Schmidt number in the scalar equations in the modified k-e model allows an earlier mixing of the hot coflow with the fuel jet. All models overpredict the lift-of f height for the standard flow conditions. Recent experiments and numerical calculations by others have shown that the vitiated coflow flame is extremely sensitive to variations in the coflow temperature. The present calculations show that this sensi- tivity is captured by the EDC combustion model, however to a smaller degree than that previously reported. Calculations with variations in coflow temperature and jet flow velocity indicate that for each flow con- dition, the various turbulence models predict the same percentage increase or decrease in lift-off height. These EDC calculations show that the turbulence model effect on the EDC predicted lift-off height is important and that a better flame structure is predicted with the RSE model by Jones and Musonge than with the other turbulence models.

AB  - Flow and pollutant dispersion in a densely built-up area of Seoul, Korea, are numerically examined using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model coupled to a mesoscale model [fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5)]. The CFD model used is a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations model with the renormalization group k-epsilon turbulence model. A one-way nesting method is employed in this study. MM5-simulated data are linearly interpolated in time and space to provide time-dependent boundary conditions for the CFD model integration. In the MM5 simulation, four one-way nested computational domains are considered, and the innermost domain with a horizontal grid size of 1 km covers the Seoul metropolitan area and its adjacent areas, including a part of the Yellow Sea. The NCEP final analysis data are used as initial and boundary conditions for MM5. MM5 is integrated for 48 h starting from 0300 LST 1 June 2004 and the coupled CFD-MM5 model is integrated for 24 h starting from 0300 LST 2 June 2004. During the two-day period, a high-pressure system was dominant over the Korean peninsula, with clear conditions and weak synoptic winds. MM5 simulates local circulations characterized by sea breezes and mountain/valley winds. MM5-simulated synoptic weather and near-surface temperatures and winds are well matched with the observed ones. Results from the coupled CFD-MM5 model simulation show that the flow in the presence of real building clusters can change significantly as the ambient wind speed and direction change. Diurnally varying local circulations mainly cause changes in ambient wind speed and direction in the present simulation. Some characteristic flows-such as the double-eddy circulation, channeling flow, and vertical recirculation vortex-are simulated. Pollutant dispersion pattern and the degree of lateral pollutant dispersion are shown to be complicated in the presence of real building clusters and under varying ambient wind speed and direction. This study suggests that because of the sensitive dependency of urban flow and pollutant dispersion on variations in ambient wind, time-dependent boundary conditions should be used to better simulate or predict them when the ambient wind varies over the period of CFD model simulation.
