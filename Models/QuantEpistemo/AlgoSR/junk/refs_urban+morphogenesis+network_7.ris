AB  - Achieving healthy urbanization in all countries is a global and shared responsibility. The elimination of deprived urban living conditions will require resources – aid, loans, private investments – from more affluent countries. The funding required is in the order of $200 billion per year, which is no more than 20% of the annual increase of the GDP in the high-income countries. Strong political commitment to better urban governance is crucial for the additional funds to bring about the intended improvements in living conditions and health equity. Creating global political support for a sustained and well-funded effort for social, economic and health equity is one of the greatest challenges of this generation.

AB  - Network analysis is on the rise across scientific disciplines because of its ability to reveal complex, and often emergent, patterns and dynamics. Nonetheless, a growing concern in network analysis is the use of limited data for constructing networks. This concern is strikingly relevant to ecology and conservation biology, where network analysis is used to infer connectivity across landscapes. In this context, movement among patches is the crucial parameter for interpreting connectivity but because of the difficulty of collecting reliable movement data, most network analysis proceeds with only indirect information on movement across landscapes rather than using observed movement to construct networks. Statistical models developed for social networks provide promising alternatives for landscape network construction because they can leverage limited movement information to predict linkages. Using two mark-recapture datasets on individual movement and connectivity across landscapes, we test whether commonly used network constructions for interpreting connectivity can predict actual linkages and network structure, and we contrast these approaches to social network models. We find that currently applied network constructions for assessing connectivity consistently, and substantially, overpredict actual connectivity, resulting in considerable overestimation of metapopulation lifetime. Furthermore, social network models provide accurate predictions of network structure, and can do so with remarkably limited data on movement. Social network models offer a flexible and powerful way for not only understanding the factors influencing connectivity but also for providing more reliable estimates of connectivity and metapopulation persistence in the face of limited data.

AB  - Corresponding with urban land use plan and network design is helpful for the sustainable development of the city. Beginning with the traffic distribution decided by urban land use composition and floor area ratio (FAR), the bi-level programming model of urban land use and network design problem was put forward. In this model, the problem was described as the game, which the upper showed the policymaker's goals with city development benefit maximization under moderating urban land use and network design, including consumer surplus maximization, investment benefit maximization, the best coordination degree of land layout, and the lower showed urban residents transportation behavior choice under the upper decisions, is a combination model of traffic and transportation allocation. The heuristic algorithm was designed to solve the model. Finally, an example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and algorithm.

AB  - The effect of inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis on the development\nof embryogenic cell cultures of celery (cv. SB 12) was studied. Several\ndevelopmental stages of somatic embryos were compared for differences\nin the content and biosynthesis of free polyamines and for cytokinin\ncontent. Cyclohexylamine and particularly methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone)\ninhibited both cell division and the organization of polar embryos\nfrom globular embryos. Difluoromethylornithine slightly promoted\nembryo development, especially cell division. The free putrescine\ncontent of globular embyros was 6-fold that of fully differentiated\nplantlets, and that of spermidine was 2-fold. Only a slight increase\nin the spermine content was found with embryo development. Incorporation\nof <sup(14)>C-arginine into polyamines was slightly higher than that\nof <sup(14)>C-ornithine. Over 96% of this incorporation was detected\nin the putrescine fraction. Incorporation of <sup(14)>C into putrescine\nin globular embryos was 3- to 4-fold that in fully-differentiated\nplantlets. Incorporation into spermidine and spermine was, however,\nhigher in plantlets. Cytokinin analysis revealed considerable differences\nin the biological activity between the developmental stages of embryogenesis.\nThis could be due to endogenous cytokinins and/or BA taken up from\nthe maintenance medium. Cytokinin levels decreased with increased\nembryo development. Most of the detected cytokinin-like activity\nco-chromatographed with BA and its metabolites. Some as yet unidentified\npeaks of activity were recorded in the globular embryos. It is suggested\nthat the onset of embryogenesis is characterized by a high content\nof putrescine and cytokinins, while a decrease in putrescine synthesis\nand cytokinin content, and an increase in spermidine and spermine\ncontent, accompany further embyro development and plantlet formation.

AB  - This paper presents an examination of the empirical merits of a set of spatial interaction indices for measuring hierarchical differentiation (i.e. dominance and connectivity) in a spatial network. To allow for the comparison of the degree of hierarchical differentiation in networks with different numbers of nodes/links, we propose to normalize the ratio between the real measures and the corresponding values for a rank size distribution in order to obtain readily interpretable measures of hierarchical differentiation. When applied to data on air passenger flows within Europe, the normalized indices, interpreted together, appear to give a good idea of the tendency toward hierarchical differentiation. The potential usefulness of this analytical framework is discussed in the context of studies on (transnational) inter-city relations and empirical assessments of changes in the spatial configuration of airline networks.

AB  - The global economy is nurturing an innovative class of polycentric urban configurations: network cities. A network city evolves when two or more previously independent cities, potentially complementary in function, strive to cooperate and achieve significant scope economies aided by fast and reliable corridors of transport and communications infrastructure. Creative network cities place a higher priority on knowledge-based activities like research, education and the creative arts. The cooperative mechanisms may resemble those of inter-firm networks in the sense that each urban player stands to benefit from the synergies of interactive growth via reciprocity, knowledge exchange and unexpected creativity. Two case studies are discussed briefly—Randstad Holland and Kansai, Japan. Since much of their future dynamism may rely upon transnational human resources, it is foreseen that more network cities will transcend national borders during the next millennium.

AB  - Summary Networks have been around for many years, long before the first home computer was ever designed or created. Other forms of networking have been around since the dawn of time. Today, designing, planning, implementing, deploying, and managing computer networks is somewhat of a never-ending journey into technology as it develops and integrates, standardizes and grows. It's amazing to see where computer networks are today from just 15 years ago. Now, more than ever, computer networks are relied upon to produce not only data in the form of files or connectivity to a printer for printingâ€¦ today, everything from surfing the Internet securely to making a call from New York to Tianjin, China over phone that solely works off the power of the network. Wired to wireless, satellites in the sky to home PC networks that allow 2 computers in your home to share the Internet at the same time. This is all done through networking. The wonderful world of networking is colorful, exciting, and is growing each and every dayâ€¦ routers, switches, and other infrastructure devices are deployed every day from companies such as Cisco, Juniper, Nortel, and 3Com to name a few. So who deploys them? Who plans, designs, and leads the way for all of this equipment to be planned, purchased, implemented, and managed? Each and every day technology grows more and more complicated, and it evolves as we do.

SOLUTION: An optical remote antenna incorporates a reception antenna 1, which induces an AC voltage according to electromagnetic waves, a light source 5, and a light modulator 3 which generates a modulated light by modulating the light sent from the light source 5 according to the AC voltage. The remote antenna also incorporates photoelectric converters 22, 32, and 42 which generates device outputs in accordance with the modulated light and an optical fiber 52 which connects the modulator 3 to the converters 22, 32, and 42. The light source 5 is constituted of a Fabry-Perot type semiconductor laser having an output optical wavelength of 1.48 &mu m band.

This study explores a variety of possible incentives and provides an empirical evaluation of their subjective relevance. The analysis is based on survey data from 129 test subjects. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identified that the satisfaction of the needs for belongingness and the esteem needs through self-presentation together with peer pressure are the main drivers of participation. The analysis of a sub- sample of active users pointed out the satisfaction of the cognitive needs as an additional participation determinant. Based on these findings, recommendations for online social network providers are made.

AB  - A number of researchers have recently tried to map the contours of a transnational urban network. Although these empirical studies have great merits in making a closer connection to theoretical ideas on a genuine urban network, they sometimes fail to recognise that the whole idea of cities as ‘nodes’ in a transnational urban network is a heuristic at best. To assess this underdeveloped analytical connection, a taxonomy of dominant empirical and theoretical approaches is constructed. Contrasting both taxonomies reveals a mismatch between theory and measurement. This mismatch is addressed in more detail through four separate but entwined examples of conceptual conflation: a lack of rigour in the employed terminologies; inappropriate discussions of results against the background of other concepts; the inadequate delineation of the urban area; and, the limited analytical value of infrastructure-based analyses.

However, little inquiry has been made into the influence that the structure of social relationships within an organization has on enhancing learning capability. Organizational learning and social network theory and methods are employed to develop a conceptual framework that links network structural attributes with learning characteristics in order to identify potential barriers to organizational learning. The results from case studies support the proposition that specific social network structures are associated with different barriers to organizational learning. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses the nature of social media and consumer-generated content, and the risks it poses to marketing communications and PR. The paper provides a valuable insight into the hitherto limited area of social media marketing, and the challenges posed by increasingly mediated, and real-time, consumer interactions. The paper reflects new lines of research, in that it draws on four ‘live’ case studies that are designed to capture the dynamic nature of consumer information flows to illustrate the risk assessment and marketing factors in PR management. The case studies are drawn from four major global brands who have engaged with social media in ways that have had unanticipated consequences. The analyses of the cases studies are used develop what is described as a ‘echo-effect’ model of social media marketing. Finally, the paper provides suggestions for further research, and protective plans that marketers can implement to mitigate potentially damaging effects.

AB  - Nowadays sustainability is among the most desired characteristics of the transport systems. Taking into account the soaring and the unpredictable rise of the transport needs in urban areas,in contrast with the suggestions for reducing individual travels,new solutions which should integrate the transport resources both of urban and suburban areas must be sought. The idea of organizing freight distribution chains through hub-and-spokes network can also be adapted for passengers transport. The infrastructure for individual transport,whenever motorised or non-motorised modes,in the proximity of large cities should also be developed to serve other high capacity transport networks,accomplishing all the traveller's needs within the sustainability framework. The technical,administrative or financial integration of peri-urban transport modes with urban public transport is a key element. The current paper highlights the particularities of such an approach and presents a case study for reorganizing the urban and peri-urban connections in Bucharest city.

AB  - All networks, including biological networks (e.g., metabolic networks, transcription regulatory networks, protein-protein interaction networks, protein structure networks, neural networks, ecological networks), social networks, technological networks (e.g., computer networks, electrical circuits), etc., can be represented as graphs, which include a wide variety of subgraphs. One important local property of networks is Network Motifs, recurrent and statistically significant sub-graphs or patterns. Motifs, sub-graphs that repeat themselves in a specific network or even among various networks, would be consistent with the tenets of evolutionary theory. Each of these sub-graphs, defined by a particular pattern of interactions between vertices, may reflect a framework in which particular functions are achieved efficiently. Indeed, motifs are of notable importance largely because they may reflect functional properties. They have recently gathered much attention as a useful concept to uncover structural design principles of complex networks.[1] Although network motifs may provide a deep insight into the network’s functional abilities, their detection is computationally challenging.

AB  - Introduction: What's different about social network data? On one hand, there really isn't anything about social network data that is all that unusual. Social network analysts do use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets of observations that they use. But, network data can also be described and understood using the ideas and concepts of more familiar methods, like cross-sectional survey research. On the other hand, the data sets that social network analysts develop usually end up looking quite different from the conventional rectangular data array so familiar to survey researchers and statistical analysts. The differences are quite important because they lead us to look at our data in a different way -- and even lead us to think differently about how to apply statistics. "Conventional" social science data consist of a rectangular array of measurements. The rows of the array are the cases, or subjects, or observations. The columns consist of scores (quantitative or qualitative) on attributes, or variables, or measures. A simple example is shown as figure 1.1. Each cell of the array then describes the score of some actor (row) on some attribute (column). In some cases, there may be a third dimension to these arrays, representing panels of observations or multiple groups.

AB  - Urban environmental stewardship activities are on the rise in cities throughout the Northeast. Groups participating in stewardship activities range in age, size, and geography and represent an increasingly complex and dynamic arrangement of civil society, government and business sectors. To better understand the structure, function and network of these community-based urban land managers, an assessment was conducted in 2004 by the research subcommittee of the Urban Ecology Collaborative. The goal of the assessment was to better understand the role of stewardship organizations engaged in urban ecology initiatives in selected major cities in the Northeastern U.S.: Boston, New Haven, New York City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. A total of 135 active organizations participated in this assessment. Findings include the discovery of a dynamic social network operating within cities, and a reserve of social capital and expertise that could be better utilized. Although often not the primary land owner, stewardship groups take an increasingly significant responsibility for a wide range of land use types including street and riparian corridors, vacant lots, public parks and gardens, green roofs, etc. Responsibilities include the delivery of public programs as well as daily maintenance and fundraising support. While most of the environmental stewardship organizations operate on staffs of zero or fewer than ten, with small cohorts of community volunteers, there is a significant difference in the total amount of program funding. Nearly all respondents agree that committed resources are scarce and insufficient with stewards relying upon and potentially competing for individual donations, local foundations, and municipal support. This makes it a challenge for the groups to grow beyond their current capacity and to develop long-term programs critical to resource management and education. It also fragments groups, making it difficult for planners and property owners to work in partnership with them. The organizational networks are self-contained and do not include business or even legal groups, which may point to a gap between stewardship and environmental justice organizations.

AB  - In contrast to the classical view of development as a preprogrammed and deterministic process, recent studies have demonstrated that stochastic perturbations of highly non-linear systems may underlie the emergence and stability of biological patterns. Herein, we address the question of whether noise contributes to the generation of the stereotypical temporal pattern in gene expression during flower development. We modeled the regulatory network of organ identity genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana flower as a stochastic system. This network has previously been shown to converge to ten fixed-point attractors, each with gene expression arrays that characterize inflorescence cells and primordial cells of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. The network used is binary, and the logical rules that govern its dynamics are grounded in experimental evidence. We introduced different levels of uncertainty in the updating rules of the network. Interestingly, for a level of noise of around 0.5-10%, the system exhibited a sequence of transitions among attractors that mimics the sequence of gene activation configurations observed in real flowers. We also implemented the gene regulatory network as a continuous system using the Glass model of differential equations, that can be considered as a first approximation of kinetic-reaction equations, but which are not necessarily equivalent to the Boolean model. Interestingly, the Glass dynamics recover a temporal sequence of attractors, that is qualitatively similar, although not identical, to that obtained using the Boolean model. Thus, time ordering in the emergence of cell-fate patterns is not an artifact of synchronous updating in the Boolean model. Therefore, our model provides a novel explanation for the emergence and robustness of the ubiquitous temporal pattern of floral organ specification. It also constitutes a new approach to understanding morphogenesis, providing predictions on the population dynamics of cells with different genetic configurations during development.

AB  - The incidence of change to existing houses and gardens within England's interwar residential areas is examined, the focus being on sample areas originally developed by private enterprise in Birmingham and London. Larger-scale changes, mostly subject to development control by the local authority, notably the building of additional houses within existing gardens, subdivisions and amalgamations of houses, changes of use, extensions and other significant structural works, are distinguished from changes initiated by households without planning permission, and often without building permission, such as changes to chimneys, reroofing, and changes to doors, windows, porches, and gardens. Changes subject to development control are negatively correlated, and smaller-scale changes are positively correlated, with the dwelling density at which the sample areas were originally developed. Among the factors responsible for this are the greater susceptibility of the areas of higher dwelling density to the contagious diffusion of minor and cosmetic changes.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - This chapter offers a commentary on the correspondence exchanged between René Thom and Conrad Hal Waddington in 1967, concerning the interpretation in terms of catastrophe theory of the concepts of epigenetic landscape and chreod, introduced by Conrad Hal Waddington since the 1940s. It is intended to provide some elements of reflection on the difficulties encountered in exchanges between a mathematician and a biologist on the subject of the mathematization – in this case by means of a “dynamical systems” approach – of a theoretical question in biology, expressed in images by the compound metaphor of epigenetic landscape. One interpretation of the disagreement between the two scholars is based on the difference between their mathematical cultures, making it difficult to establish a shared dictionary (this was René Thom’s view). But another aspect must be taken into account to understand the difficulties of dialogue between the two scientists: the choice of variables (and the timescale specific to each of them) used to construct a mathematical model of the epigenetic landscape.

AB  - Mines open source project success? In this study, we investigate the impact of network social capital - the benefits open source developers secure from their memberships in a developer collaboration network - on open source project success. We focus on one specific type of success as measured by the productivity of open source project team. Specific hypotheses are developed and tested on a longitudinal panel of 2378 projects hosted at Sourceforge. We find that network social capital is not equally accessible to or appropriated by all projects. Our main results are (1) teams with greater internal cohesion are more successful, (2) external cohesion (cohesion among the external contacts of a team) has an inverse U-shaped relationship with the project's success; moderate levels of external cohesion are the best for a project's success, rather than very low or very high levels of this variable, (3) the technological diversity of a contact also has the greatest benefit when it is neither too low nor too high, and (4) the number of direct and indirect external contacts are positively correlated with a project's success with the effect of the number of direct contacts being moderated by the number of indirect contacts. These results are robust to a number of control variables and alternate model specifications. Several theoretical and managerial implications are provided.

AB  - This research is concerned with the automatic generalisation of road networks from a single detailed database. The challenge of representing networks at changing scales is that we retain the essence of connectivity and continuity throughout the network, whilst reducing the level of detail. The algorithm builds on prior work concerning the perceptual organisation of map objects, and has as its focus the urban network (rather than the rural) where particular challenges exist. When simplifying the city network, it is important to retain its links with the surrounding rural region. The algorithm focuses on identifying and retaining those parts of the network that best define and demarcate the various regions that typically comprise the city. It does this through the use of both graph theoretic constructs, and analysis of the areal partitions created by the existence of a network. The implementation, within an object oriented GIS is outlined, and the effectiveness of the technique illustrated and evaluated.

Study of developmental biology in the molecular era began by concentrating on simpler aspects such as gene control and signalling, and treated morphogenesis as a ‘black box’. Now, molecular analysis is being extended to the creation of form. This book presents examples of how morphogenesis happens and is organized by topic, beginning at the level of supramolecular complexes, then the level of individual cells and moving on to the level of tissues. The approach stresses the underlying abstract principles behind different examples and the relationships between different elements in the morphogenetic toolkit.

Subsections of the declaration deal with an urban world, a global city, migrant cities, unsustainable urban-natural relations, neoliberalization, attacks on democracy, community vulnerability, the rise of racism, and some thoughts on possible alternatives. The strategic purpose of this declaration was to be an intervention at meetings of the international urban community, for example for the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in January 2003 and similar regional and local events. The declaration is published here in order to invite debate among other scholars and activists on the issues raised in its theses and statements.

AB  - This paper describes a mobile prototype and a protocol to measure light pollution based on astronomical methods. The prototype takes three all-sky images using BVR filters of the Johnson-Cousins astronomical photometric system. The stars are then identified in the images of the Hipparcos and General Catalogue of Photometric Data II astronomical catalogues, and are used as calibration sources. This method permits the measurement of night-sky brightness and facilitates an estimate of which fraction is due to the light up-scattered in the atmosphere by a wide variety of man-made sources. This is achieved by our software, which compares the sky background flux to that of many stars of known brightness. The reduced weight and dimensions of the prototype allow the user to make measurements from virtually any location. This prototype is capable of measuring the sky distribution of light pollution, and also provides an accurate estimate of the background flux at each photometric band.

AB  - The role of proteinases in extracellular matrix remodeling during the developmental program of bone, cartilage, muscle, and epithelial differentiation in the mandibular arch during embryogenesis was investigated. ECM changes accompany morphogenesis during development. The most dramatic changes occur during development of bone and cartilage. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was altered by regulating expression of MMPs by growth factors, by inhibiting MMP activity, and by genetic ablation of MMPs. The data point to critical roles for MMPs in cartilage development and endochondral bone formation. MMPs appear to regulate not only ECM degradation but also programmed cell death, cell migration, and invasion during these morphogenic processes. The data suggest that matrix metalloproteinases play it pivotal role in the morphogenesis of structures derived from epithelium (oral sulcus), semitic mesoderm (tongue), and cranial neural crest (Meckel's cartilage).

AB  - Foreword : Railway stations are at the heart of the nation’s psyche. They feature in blockbuster films, romantic novels and the skylines of many towns and cities. However, they are far more important to the nation than as mere artistic reference points. Millions of people use the nation’s railway stations every day. Towns and cities have often developed around them, placing railway stations in the heart of many communities. The station can often help to provide an identity or symbol for the town or city; it can act as a point of reference as well as a civic amenity for people who want to use the station’s facilities, whether they are travelling or not. Done well, their design and operation helps to facilitate the success of the national rail network. A successful railway station will add to the passenger experience as well as support the economic, social and environmental benefits of rail. Their effective integration with other modes of transport and the surrounding area can provide for an end-to-end journey experience that makes sustainable public transport a real alternative to private vehicle usage. Given these varying demands on stations it is vitally important that they are planned, designed and improved in a manner that recognises all that they have to offer. I hope that this Guide will aid promoters, planners, architects and sponsors of station schemes to develop railway stations that maintain and enhance the legacy and contribution of stations going forward. Finally, I would like to thank the individuals and organisations who helped to shape and review this document including: Department for Transport, CABE, Transport for London, Stagecoach South West Trains, First Group, Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch, English Heritage, PTEG

AB  - The federal Early Head Start (EHS) program began in 1995, and a randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 EHS programs. In all, 3,001 low-income families (35% African American, 24% Hispanic, and 37% White) with a pregnant women or an infant under the age of 12 months were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group (with 91% of the treatment group receiving some services). Data were collected when the children were about 1, 2, and 3 years of age, and at age 5 (2 years after leaving EHS). Research questions examined (1) impacts of EHS at ages 2 and 3 (when services were being offered) and at age 5, and (2) contributions of early education experiences across children's first 5 years of life. Child outcomes included cognition, language, attention, behavior problems, and health; maternal outcomes included parenting, mental health, and employment. Overall impact analyses at ages 2 and 3 indicated that EHS benefited children and families: impacts were seen in all domains, with effect sizes of significant impacts ranging from .10 to .20. At age 5, EHS children had better attention and approaches toward learning as well as fewer behavior problems than the control group, although they did not differ on early school achievement. Subgroup analyses indicated that cognitive impacts were sustained 2 years after the program ended for African American children and language impacts for Hispanic children who spoke Spanish. Some significant family benefits were seen at age 5. Mediated analyses identified which child and family impacts at ages 2 and 3 contributed to the child impacts at age 5 (most relevant were earlier treatment effects on child cognition and on engagement with the parent). Growth curve analyses were also conducted. Although fewer than half the children enrolled in center-based preschool programs between ages 3 and 4, almost 90% participated in the year preceding kindergarten. A higher percentage of EHS than control children were enrolled. Nonexperimental analyses suggested that formal program participation enhanced children's readiness for school while also increasing parent-reported aggression. At age 5, those children and families who experienced EHS followed by formal programs fared best overall. However, the benefits of the two experiences were associated with outcomes in different ways. Benefits in language, behavior, and parenting were associated primarily with EHS; benefits in early school achievement were associated primarily with preschool attendance.

AB  - We present a network model and its dynamic analysis for the regulatory relationships among 11 genes that participate in Arabidopsis thaliana flower morphogenesis. The topology of the network and the relative strengths of interactions among these genes were based from published genetic and molecular data, mainly relying on mRNA expression patterns under wild type and mutant backgrounds. The network model is made of binary elements and we used a particular dynamic implementation for the network that we call semi-synchronic. Using this method the network reaches six attractors; four of them correspond to observed patterns of gene expression found in the floral organs of Arabidopsis (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) as predicted by the ABC model of flower morphogenesis. The fifth state corresponds to cells that are not competent to flowering, and the sixth attractor predicted by the model is never found in wild-type plants, but it could be induced experimentally. We discuss the biological implications and the potential use of this network modeling approach to integrate functional data of regulatory genes of plant development.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for building performance assessment among architects mostly due to a rising awareness for issues related to environmental sustainability. However, after thirty years of research, interoperability of performance analysis tools with CAAD environments is still far from being seamless. Yet, all commercial CAAD vendors have recently started offering an array of building analysis tools. It is fair to expect a new surge of efforts in integrating prediction and evaluation capabilities within CAAD systems over the next few years. Building on lessons learned, this paper argues the need for a unification infrastructure for building performance and outlines the requirements for building an analysis network.

AB  - A social network [2] is a description of the social structure between actors, mostly persons, groups or organizations. It indicates the ways in which they are connected with each other by some relationship such as friendship, kinship, finance exchange etc. In a nutshell, when the person uses already known/unknown people to create new contacts, it forms social networking. The social network is not a new concept rather it can be formed when similar people interact with each other directly or indirectly to perform particular task. Examples of social networks include a friendship networks, collaboration networks, co-authorship networks, and co-employees networks which depict the direct interaction among the people. There are also other forms of social networks, such as entertainment networks, business Networks, citation networks, and hyperlink networks, in which interaction among the people is indirect. Generally, social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations and assists in improving interactive knowledge sharing, interoperability and collaboration.

AB  - As the world shrinks into a ‘global village’, cities have come into focus as dominant nodes in the global transactions and flows of capital, commodities, people and services. The resulting economic cum information order is not only transforming the architecture of discrete cities everywhere but is alsomotivating newpatterns of inter-city relations and networks. Global urban network is now synonymous with the trans-state processes that make up the global economy (Taylor, Political Geography 19:5–32, 2000). Hence, cities are increasing perceived as a new ‘resource’ and ‘spring board’ for connecting to and operating at the global level. The article explores these issues with reference to the place and function of African cities in the global urban network.A city- based assessment of this nature offers a fresh and fluid scope to African development question and quest as against the more conventional ‘state-centric’ benchmarking.

AB  - The present study examined the influence of bilateral peripheral vestibular loss (BVL) in humans on postural responses to multidirectional surface rotations in the pitch and roll planes. Specifically, we examined the effects of vestibular loss on the directional sensitivity, timing, and amplitude of early stretch, balance correcting, and stabilizing reactions in postural leg and trunk muscles as well as changes in ankle torque and trunk angular velocity following multidirectional rotational perturbations of the support surface. Fourteen normal healthy adults and five BVL patients stood on a dual axis rotating platform which rotated 7.5 degrees at 50 degrees/s through eight different directions of pitch and roll combinations separated by 45 degrees. Directions were randomized within a series of 44 perturbation trials which were presented first with eyes open, followed by a second series of trials with eyes closed. Vestibular loss did not influence the range of activation or direction of maximum sensitivity for balance correcting responses (120-220 ms). Response onsets at approximately 120 ms were normal in tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), paraspinals (PARAS), or quadriceps muscles. Only SOL muscle activity demonstrated a 38- to 45-ms delay for combinations of forward (toe-down) and roll perturbations in BVL patients. The amplitude of balance correcting responses in leg muscles between 120 and 220 ms was, with one exception, severely reduced in BVL patients for eyes open and eyes closed conditions. SOL responses were decreased bilaterally for toe-up and toe-down perturbations, but more significantly reduced in the downhill (load-bearing) leg for combined roll and pitch perturbations. TA was significantly reduced bilaterally for toe-up perturbations, and in the downhill leg for backward roll perturbations. Forward perturbations, however, elicited significantly larger TA activity in BVL between 120 and 220 ms compared to normals, which would act to further destabilize the body. As a result of these changes in response amplitudes, BVL patients had reduced balance correcting ankle torque between 160 and 260 ms and increased torque between 280 and 380 ms compared to normals. There were no differences in the orientation of the resultant ankle torque vectors between BVL and normals, both of which were oriented primarily along the pitch plane. For combinations of backward (toe-up) and roll perturbations BVL patients had larger balance correcting and stabilizing reactions (between 350 and 700 ms) in PARAS than normals and these corresponded to excessive trunk pitch and roll velocities. During roll perturbations, trunk velocities in BVL subjects after 200 ms were directed along directions different from those of normals. Furthermore, roll instabilities appeared later than those of pitch particularly for backward roll perturbations. The results of the study show that combinations of roll and pitch surface rotations yield important spatiotemporal information, especially with respect to trunk response strategies changed by BVL which are not revealed by pitch plane perturbations alone. Our results indicate that vestibular influences are earlier for the pitch plane and are directed to leg muscles, whereas roll control is later and focused on trunk muscles.

AB  - In eukaryotes, cell morphogenesis is regulated coordinately with the cell cycle. In fission yeast, the morphogenesis network MOR (morphogenesis Orb6 network) consists of 5 conserved proteins, Pmo25, Nak1, Mor2, Orb6, and Mob2, and is essential for cell polarity control and cell separation following cytokinesis. Here we show that the conserved leucine-rich repeat protein Lrp1 is required for cell morphogenesis as a newly recognized component of MOR. Lrp1 has 4 leucine-rich repeats in its N-terminus and is a homolog of the budding yeast Sog2, which is a component of the RAM network (regulation of Ace2 activity and cellular morphogenesis). Lrp1 was essential for both cell growth and cell morphogenesis as were the other MOR components. Lrp1 was localized to the SPBs (spindle pole bodies, the yeast equivalent of the animal centrosome) throughout the cell cycle and to the medial ring during cytokinesis. Lrp1 interacted with Nak1 and was important for Orb6 kinase activity. Thus Lrp1 proved to function upstream of Orb6 in cell morphogenesis.

AB  - In this paper, we present two methods for classification of different social network actors (individuals or organizations) such as leaders (e.g., news groups), lurkers, spammers and close associates. The first method is a two-stage process with a fuzzy-set theoretic (FST) approach to evaluation of the strengths of network links (or equivalently, actor-actor relationships) followed by a simple linear classifier to separate the actor classes. Since this method uses a lot of contextual information including actor profiles, actor-actor tweet and reply frequencies, it may be termed as a context-dependent approach. To handle the situation of limited availability of actor data for learning network link strengths, we also present a second method that performs actor classification by matching their short-term (say, roughly 25 days) tweet patterns with the generic tweet patterns of the prototype actors of different classes. Since little contextual information is used here, this can be called a context-independent approach. Our experimentation with over 500 randomly sampled records from a twitter database consists of 441,234 actors, 2,045,804 links, 6,481,900 tweets, and 2,312,927 total reply messages indicates that, in the context-independent analysis, a multilayer perceptron outperforms on both on classification accuracy and a new F-measure for classification performance, the Bayes classifier and Random Forest classifiers. However, as expected, the context-dependent analysis using link strengths evaluated using the FST approach in conjunction with some actor information reveals strong clustering of actor data based on their types, and hence can be considered as a superior approach when data available for training the system is abundant.

AB  - The exquisitely beautiful form of a developing embryo is the result of a coordination between the driving forces of morphogenesis and the processes of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and death. Morphogenesis is responsible for bringing cell populations together for new inductive interactions and for building complex, three-dimensional structures such as hearts, limbs, lungs, and eyes out of simple epithelial sheets and mes- enchymal cell masses. Research over the past two de- cades has elucidated many of the genetic pathways underlying cell division, cell fate determination, and dif- ferentiation, and has shown them to be evolutionarily conserved. A major challenge now is to explore the possibility that there is also a conserved “morphoge- netic code”—a set of rules common to processes that are used repeatedly in different combinations to make functional organs. These instructions fall into two cate- gories. First, there are basic subroutines that define es- sentially mechanical operations such as the packaging of cells into segments, the folding of epithelial sheets into tubes or cups, and the outgrowth of buds. Each of these modules utilizes sets of genes controlling proper-ties such as differential cell adhesion, cell motility, cell- matrix interactions, and cytoskeletal organization. The second category determines how these subrou- tines are coordinated with cell proliferation and cell fate determination. This “project management” depends on signaling centers that arise in the organ primordia or progenitor fields at positions initially determined by the primary embryonic axes. Each center is a group of cells that regulates the behavior of surrounding cells by pro- ducing positive and negative intercellular signaling mol- ecules. Evidence is beginning to accumulate that the majority of these signaling factors are proteins encoded by a relatively small number of conserved multigene families, in particular the Fgfs,Bmps, Hedgehogs, Wnts, and Egfs. The diverse biological activities of individual ligands are regulated byantagonists, activators, or post- translational modifiers that control, for example, the range over which the protein can function or its half- life in the environment. In addition, the signaling genes themselves are often transcriptionally regulated by posi- tive and/or negative feedback loops. An exciting pros- pect for the future is the possibility of being able to compute how each of these variables, in combination with the downstream subroutines they control, ulti- mately affects the size, shape, and pattern of a particular organ.

In order to provide services to globalizing corporate clients, the offices of major financial and business service firms across the world have formed a network. It is the myriad of flows between office towers in different metropolitan centres that has produced a world city network.\n\nThrough an analysis of the intra-company flows of 100 leading global service firms across 315 cities, this book assesses cities in terms of their overall network connectivity, their connectivity by service sector, and their connectivity by world region.\n\nPeter Taylor's unique and illuminating book provides the first comprehensive and systematic description and analysis of the world city network as the 'skeleton' upon which contemporary globalization has been built. His analyses challenge the traditional view of the world as a 'mosaic map' of political boundaries.\n\nWritten by one of the foremost authorities on the subject, this book provides a much needed mapping of the connecting relationships between world cities, and will be an enlightening book for students of urban studies, geography, sociology and planning.

AB  - Research on why neighborhood disadvantage matters for health focuses on the capacity of neighborhoods to regulate residents' behavior through informal social control. The authors extend this research by conducting a multilevel analysis of data from a 1995 telephone survey of 497 residents of 32 neighborhoods in a U.S. city. The authors find that network social capital mediates the contextual effect of neighborhood disadvantage on depressive symptoms and that health effects of network social capital persist when perceived neighborhood disorder, a standard indicator of low informal social control, is controlled for. The findings demonstrate the value of a conceptualization and measurement of network social capital that (1) considers ties that transcend neighborhood boundaries, (2) investigates health benefits of network social capital in the forms of closure and embedded support resources and range and embedded instrumental resources, and (3) uses network data on specific network members with strong and weak ties to respondents.

AB  - Polycentric urban regions, or urban networks, are often associated with the notion of synergy, the assumption being that the individual cities in these collections of distinct but proximally located cities relate to each other in a synergetic way, making the whole network of cities more than the sum of its parts. Drawing on economic network theories, an analysis of the presence of synergy is carried out for the Randstad region in the Netherlands, which is often considered a classic example of a polycentric urban region. The analysis focuses on the synergy mechanisms of co-operation and in particular complementarity. The results are mixed. In terms of co-operation, the Randstad has become more synergetic. However, the less complementary economic roles of the cities caused a reverse effect.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - This chapter examines several case studies dealing with real-life phishing attacks. The MySpace users were receiving heavy volumes of spam whereby the messages that they received gave the impression that the site had fallen prey to exploits where spammers were gaining access to individual accounts. MySpace was notified immediately thereafter about the activity. The activity was tied to a hack, resulting in hundreds of identical status updates to particular band profiles. The resulting activity caused MySpace users to respond to the attacks by re-entering their account credentials, which then subsequently caused them to receive volumes of spam within the accounts. A similar attack against Facebook was performed, which involved redirecting unsuspecting subscribers to the same location where they would instead be prompted to a log-in page presenting itself as a Facebook log-in page. Twitter also became a victim of a similar phishing attack where subscribers of the service were targets to messages, which had supposedly been sent by a friend or a contact who was allowed to follow tweets. When dealing with phishing attacks, the most appropriate action is to examine the message and validate the source. Exploitation often is a result of taking advantage of systems that lack the necessary patches and preventative tools to be on the Internet so it is also recommended to safeguard the computers.

AB  - A clear and accurate understanding of communication network performance is essential, especially where all layers of the protocol stack - from physical propagation to application transport protocols - must be accounted for. While some solutions exist for RF communications over `open-terrain' areas, the urban environment is particularly challenging. To meet this challenge, a server-based, real-time solution for assessing complex communication and network effects in urban environments has been developed. By combining advanced RF ray-tracing propagation modeling and a full network simulator, the Scalable Urban Network Simulation (SUNS) software is able to provide accurate communications effects services. SUNS supports tactical modeling and simulation by predicting electro-magnetic signal coverage and path loss through application of a full 3D physical knowledge of the urban environment and terrain features. The commercial OPNET network simulator is used as the core of the system, with SUNS operations supported through a custom OPNET model that functions as a modeling and simulation server. The server, in turn, communicates with other node models within the OPNET simulation. In the approach, urban propagation data are pre-computed using high-performance computing (HPC) resources utilizing ray traced models of the urban scene.

AB  - Since the mid-1970s, Vietnam experienced a period of transition to socialism, before bringing in economic reforms which led to the gradual dismantling of the subsidised system of planning and the opening up of the country to the global capitalist economy. Economic reform and renovation has important implications for the urban areas of Vietnam. The emergence of markets and the abandonment of many restrictions on travel resulted in a freeing up of the urbanisation process during the 1980s and early 1990s. These processes are considered, and the implications for Vietnam's largest urban area, Ho Chi Minh City, are examined. The likely impact of Vietnam's long-term socioeconomic strategy on the urban network in the remainder of the decade is considered.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

AB  - What's different about social network data? On one hand, there really isn't anything about social network data that is all that unusual. Networkers do use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets of observations that they use. But, network data can also be described and understood using the ideas and concepts of more familiar methods, like cross-sectional survey research. On the other hand, the data sets that networkers develop usually end up looking quite different from the conventional rectangular data array so familiar to survey researchers and statistical analysts. The differences are quite important because they lead us to look at our data in a different way - and even lead us to think differently about how to apply statistics.

The paper describes strategies which seek to implement this new regional planning guideline. The formation of an urban forum as a co-ordinating body has initiated a course of development which attempts to link aspects of both horizontal and vertical policy co-ordination within a framework of territorial integration (networking). The paper analyses this innovative instrument of urban and regional development. The authors focus on the process of co-operation, beginning with the looser form practised in the urban forum by the towns which participated and evolving towards defined contractual and institutional relations in the form of a networked urban workgroup. Finally, they evaluate the objectives achieved and the financial and legal instruments applied.

AB  - The role of robust communications plays an ever pervasive and critical role in today's network-oriented asymmetric warfare. This is especially true in urban environments, where insurgencies tend to be most active and detrimental to the civilian population. Urban-level communications needs to be addressed through a new generation of modeling and simulation tools that not only model the physical layers of radio communications, but that also account for reactive network behaviors that drive higher-level force actions (e.g., the interplay of ground troops, ground vehicles, airborne UAVs, manned aircraft, etc.) Such tools should become essential to communications mission planning, while advancing the deployment of optimally designed communications systems for use in highly complex RF environments. To this end, we describe the Scalable Urban Network Simulation (SUNS), which coordinates physical layer EM propagation modeling with network-level and higher "forces level" modeling to achieve a highly interactive, "full communications stack" approach to network simulation.

The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model.

AB  - Conceptually, the degrees of spatial and functional integration and urban complementarities in economic network relations are hypothesised to be important. In this paper, data on interfirm relations in the Dutch Randstad are used to test conditions for integration and the existence of economic complementarities. A clear hierarchy is observed in the different types of spatial interdependencies in the Randstad, in which the central place model prevails. Furthermore, no evidence is found for the functional integration of municipalities in the Randstad. It is concluded that, at this moment, the Randstad does not function as a spatially and functionally integrated region and that spatial economic policy can better focus on smaller regions within the Randstad. This also calls into question the applicability of the urban network concept in general, as the Dutch Randstad is usually seen as a prime example of an economically successful polycentric urban system.

AB  - GM production is up, but that doesn't mean Latin Americans like or want it, say Luisa Massarani, Ildeu de Castro Moreira and  Ana Maria Vara*.\n\nA report launched by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) in March 2010 paints a rosy picture of small-scale farmers embracing — and benefitting from — genetic modification (GM) technology at a rapid pace (see GM crops flourishing in developing world, says report).\n\nBut recent research from China shows that wide planting of GM cotton has caused a surge in pests (see Bt cotton linked with surge in crop pest).\n\nOur experience in Brazil and Argentina — both among the world's top producers of GM crops — similarly indicates that growth in GM crop production has guaranteed neither wide-scale social acceptance of the technology nor benefits for small-scale farmers.\n\nEarly acclaim\n\nIt is true that when, in the late 1990s, international agribusiness Monsanto introduced Argentina to Roundup Ready soya (a crop designed to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate), politicians and many commercialfarmers welcomed it with open arms.\n\nVery early on, multinational corporations and farmers' associations began an intense promotional campaign for GM crops, trading on the country's view of itself as a leading grain producer.\n\nJust one government office was responsible for GM crops, and this helped ensure the legal system didn't pose any obstacles. In fact, the issue of GM food was never really put up for public debate.\n\nAnd Monsanto's GM soya arrived in Argentina when the country was entering a major economic crisis, and agricultural income was badly needed.\n\nThere were other favourable economic factors too. Monsanto didn't have a monopoly over the technology because it could not patent its Roundup Ready soya in Argentina. Also, glyphosate was no longer under patent; field machinery was easily accessible under contract; and to GM needed less field labour compared with non-GM soya.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, GM soya was highly profitable, especially when combined with non-till practices and an increase in agro-chemical use. All these factors contributed GM soya's rapid penetration into Argentinean agriculture.\n\nBut our interviews and focus groups with about 50 Argentinean small-scale farmers in 2007revealed concern about the social changes the switch to GM soya causes. GM profits for many came not from growing the crop themselves, but from renting their land to commercial farmers for large-scale production.\n\nThis threatens sustainability because it increases small-scale farmers' reliance on external parties for their income, and can also mean both agricultural skills and land fertility are lost.\n\nBattle for Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the opposition to GM crops has been much more overt, with Monsanto's move to introduce Roundup Ready soya sparking almost a decade of controversies and legal disputes.\n\nAs early as 1998the Worker's Party — the main opposition party at the time— adopted an anti-GM stance. Some state governments too, for example in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná, ideologically opposed GM crops and even implemented local legislation to prohibit them.\n\nEnvironmental groupsand social movements, such as Greenpeace and the Movement of the Landless Rural Workers, also took up anti-GM positions and were much more vocal and active in campaigning against GM crops than their Argentinean counterparts.\n\nAnd if political divisions have characterised the GM debate in Brazil, so too have divisions within the scientific community.\n\nThe community generally supported research into GM crops. The Brazilian Academy of Science also supported growing them. But several prominent scientists, including Glaci Zancan, then president of the Brazilian Association for the Advancement of Science, opposed commercial GM crops in the absence of long-term studies on health and environmental impacts.  \n\nOvercoming opposition\n\nDespite the controversy and criticism, GM crop cultivation has expanded rapidly in Brazil, even before it was legally approved in 2005. Our focus groups and individual interviews with about 80 Brazilian stakeholders and approximately 200 small-scale farmers reveal many reasons for this growth.\n\nThey include the use of non-approved GM seeds illegally brought over from Argentina; a curiosity for testing new seeds; pressures to keep the harvest as economically productive as possible; and the fact that, in some regions, conventional soya seeds are becoming hard to find.\n\nBut more important than these factors has been the clever tactics employed by the pro-GM lobby, which even include — according to some of our interviewees — doling out free GM seeds.\n\nThe most significant move was the tactic that got GM soya legalised in 2005. The pro-GM lobby got the issue of stem cell research onto the same bill as GM soya — the biosafety law. This move capitalised on the much broader support among politicians, scientists and the public for stem cell research.\n\nThe strategy worked — the bill was passed by parliament by 352 votes to 60, and officially enabled the production and sale of GM soya in Brazil.\n\nBut the debate is far from over. There are still strong tensions around GM within government, and small-scale farmers remain unconvinced. Our research found a strong demand for unbiased information on GM crops and three national surveys also found a lack of acceptance of GM crops, even among farmers growing GM soya. Indeed, a common refrain among those we interviewed was "I'm happy to grow it, but I wouldn't eat it".\n\nIn Latin America, as in many developing regions of the world, the GM debate is 'messy'. There is a danger in interpreting a simple increase in GM crop cultivation as a sign that countries are wholeheartedly in favour of the technology, or that acceptance and benefits are widespread.\n\nLuisa Massarani is Latin America and Caribbean coordinator for SciDev.Net and researcher at Museum of Life, House of Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz, Brazil.\n\nIldeu de Castro Moreira is a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAna Maria Vara is a researcher at the National University of San Martín, Argentina.\n\n*The authors thank Carla Almeida and Fabio Gouveia for their contributions to both this article and the research project it mentions, which was supported by the International Development Research Centre

AB  - With an abundance of social network data being released, the need to protect sensitive information within these networks has become an important concern of data publishers. To achieve this objective, various notions of k-anonymization have been proposed for social network graphs. In this paper we focus on the complexity of optimization problems that arise from trying to anonymize graphs, establishing that optimally k-anonymizing the label sequences of edge-labeled graphs is intractable. We show how this result implies intractability for other notions of k-anonymization in literature. We also consider the case of bipartite social network graphs which arise from the representation of distinct entities, such as movies and viewers, patients and drugs, or products and customers. Within this setting we demonstrate that, although k-anonymizing edge-labeled graphs is intractable for k ≥ 3, polynomial time algorithms exist for arbitrary bipartite graphs when k = 2 and for unlabeled bipartite graphs irrespective of the value of k. Finally, in this paper we extend the study of attribute disclosure within the context of social networks by defining t-closeness, a measure of how effectively an adversary can determine sensitive information about members of a k-anonymous social network.

AB  - Phylogenetic methods for the analysis of species data are widely used in evolutionary studies. However, preliminary data transformations and data reduction procedures (such as a size-correction and principal components analysis, PCA) are often performed without first correcting for nonindependence among the observations for species. In the present short comment and attached R and MATLAB code, I provide an overview of statistically correct procedures for phylogenetic size-correction and PCA. I also show that ignoring phylogeny in preliminary transformations can result in significantly elevated variance and type I error in our statistical estimators, even if subsequent analysis of the transformed data is performed using phylogenetic methods. This means that ignoring phylogeny during preliminary data transformations can possibly lead to spurious results in phylogenetic statistical analyses of species data.

AB  - With the rise of ubiquitous computing in recent years, concepts of spatiality have become a significant topic of discussion in design and development of multimedia systems. This article investigates spatial practices at the intersection of youth, technology, and urban space in Seoul, and examines what the author calls ‘transyouth’: in the South Korean context, these people are between the ages of 18 and 24, situated on the delicate border between digital natives and immigrants in Prensky’s [46] terms. In the first section, the article sets out the technosocial environment of contemporary Seoul. This is followed by a discussion of social networking processes derived from semi-structured interviews conducted in 2007–2008 with Seoul transyouth about their ‘lived experiences of the city.’ Interviewees reported how they interact to play, work, and live with and within the city’s unique environment. The article develops a theme of how technosocial convergence (re)creates urban environments and argues for a need to consider such user-driven spatial recreation in designing cities as (ubiquitous) urban networks in recognition of its changing technosocial contours of connections. This is explored in three spaces of different scales: Cyworld as an online social networking space; cocoon housing—a form of individual residential space which is growing rapidly in many Korean cities—as a private living space; and ubiquitous City as the future macro-space of Seoul.

AB  - With the almost ubiquitous availability of wireless communication networks and the increasing communication capabilities of electronic devices, the prediction that most devices are constantly connected to the Internet is fast becoming a reality. Furthermore, the speed of the wireless networks is increasing at a fast rate. In a vehicular environment, passengers and vehicular sensors can access services in the Internet by utilizing a mobile network architecture which connects the vehicular network to the Internet through heterogeneous of a mobile network architecture using mobile routers, e.g. the NEMO architecture, allows the devices within the vehicle to connect to a vehicular wired or wireless local area network. The mobile router can then forward data between the local area network and the Internet using multiple access networks, external antennas outside the vehicle, and higher transmission power. These characteristics of the NEMO architecture increase the number of connectivity options to the devices connected to the vehicular network, thus increasing the available bandwidth and decreasing the cost of communications. However, the long latency of handoffs, and the overheads of the protocols involved in NEMO may limit the benefits and applicability of a NEMO based architecture. This chapter presents a mobile network architecture which addresses the handoff delays and protocol overheads of NEMO. The feasibility of the architecture is evaluated by comparing its performance with state of the art proposals using both analytical and empirical data.

AB  - Within the field of social capital study, concerns have been expressed that deviations from a fundamental understanding that social capital is captured from embedded resources in social networks may reduce the intellectual enterprise to a catch all fad (Lin, Cook, Burt, 1999). This paper is an argument that sometime in 2004, when broadband internet connections became more prevalent than those of less capacity, individuals became empowered as our most intense form of media. Scaled up effects of the Individual as Medium including: increased information flow, exertion of influence, expansion of social credentials and reinforcement of identity and recognition, are consistent with a network theory of social capital. Corporations are exposed to new risks and opportunities due to these scaled up forms of social capital and they require new methods to manage them. Social Capital Value Add is introduced as such a new method, designed to link the pioneering intellectual enterprise of social capital to value based management and the priorities of marketers. A plausible SCVA valuation method is proposed to demonstrate how these links may be articulated in a way that is meaningful for investors and corporate managers.

Structural statistics, such as power-law degree distribution, reciprocity, assortativity, and bow-tie structure are discussed. Moreover, physicians’ demographic information is included in our analysis to uncover features of the network. We discover the community structure of the network on the basis of physicians’ specialties. Inter- and intra-specialty communications are examined. Our study contributes to the literature a study on a medium-scale professional social network.

AB  - This paper investigates two fundamental characteristics of a wireless multihop network: its minimumnode degree and its k–connectivity. Both topology attributes depend on the spatial distribution of the nodes and their transmission range. Using typical modeling assumptions — a random uniform distribution of the nodes and a simple link model — we derive an analytical expression that enables the determination of the required range r0 that creates, for a given node density ρ,an almost surely k–connected network. Equivalently, if the maximum r0 of the nodes is given, we can find out how many nodes are needed to cover a certain area with a k–connected network. We also investigate these questions by various simulations and thereby verify our analytical expressions. Finally, the impact of mobility is discussed. The results of this paper are of practical value for researchers in this area, e.g., if they set the parameters in a network–level simulation of a mobile ad hoc network or if they design a wireless sensor network.

Among the priorities that it identified for attention was the need for the exchange of information and experience, particularly with regards to the preventive and early diagnosis programmes of the Member States. Such initiatives were reinforced with the establishment of the ‘Europe Against Cancer’ (EAC) programme, which included a branch of secondary prevention, i.e. systematic population-based screening for specific sites of cancer where such interventions had been judged to be effective.2 Acknowledging that some Member States were already considering a national breast screening programme, a plan was developed to enable each of the twelve Member States of the European Community to propose a pilot-screening project within its borders. The European Breast Screening Network (EBSN) thus created has now been in existence for more than a decade. The majority of its screening programmes have progressed through their implementation phases, have introduced continuing quality improvement procedures, and now have entered the phase of programme evaluation.

AB  - This paper describes a type of project that images a city as it might exist given the integration of hemostatic procedures within pedestrian networks during emergencies requiring full-scale egress from an urban core. It articulates the steps taken to integrate a pre-existing C++ hemostasis model (C. Jacob, 2008) into Maya software in order to describe how the project operates on a computational level. By projecting these agent-based logics directly into/onto each pedestrian in the city (the smallest unit of the system), egress-oriented infrastructure can shift from being extensively predetermined in form (concrete barriers, metal railing, police barricades, etc.), to something more intensively defined, real-time, and locally on-demand. These procedures are situated within a larger schema based on the structural principles of Norbert Wiener's cybernetic feedback loops, that acknowledge and allow for hybrid (top-down + bottom-up) awareness and control within systems. The project attempts to ally itself with emerging forms of network design with similar structural typologies supported through the use of personal mobile devices (PMDs) in urban environments.

AB  - The road pricing is regarded as a transport policy to realize the efficient use of urban network. The network analysis with variable demand has been often applied to describe the network level of congestion pricing on the urban network. In the study, the cordon pricing system is analyzed to implement in the urban area with practical approach. It is assumed that the congestion tolls are collected in crossing the cordon lines on the network. Therefore, the scale of cordon zones and the values of congestion tolls would be determined simultaneously to produce the maximum social net benefit. The combinatorial optimization with unit price is formulated. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied as a practical method to provide the solutions for the combinatorial optimization problem. As the pattern of cordon pricing is determined, the performance of system is estimated to confirm the applicability. It is concluded that the cordon pricing can be applied with the practical approach.

AB  - Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides graph algorithms to characterize the structure of social networks, strategic positions in these networks, specific sub-networks and decompositions of people and activities. Online social platforms like Facebook form huge social networks, enabling people to connect, interact and share their online activities across several social applications. We extended SNA operators using semantic web frameworks to include the semantics of these graph-based representations when analyzing such social networks and to deal with the diversity of their relations and interactions. We present here the results of this approach when it was used to analyze a real social network with 60,000 users connecting, interacting and sharing content.

AB  - This study examined native bird communities in forest patches across a gradient  of urbanization. We used field data and multivariate statistical techniques to examine the  effects of landscape context, roads, traffic noise, and vegetation characteristics on bird  community composition in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A.). Landscape-level  variables, particularly those related to urbanization, were most important in structuring  forest bird communities. Specifically, we found that road density and amount of urban land  cover were the best predictors of species composition. We found that urban and rural bird  communities were quite distinct from each other. Rural communities had more long-  distance migrants and forest interior species but species richness did not differ between the  communities. Our results suggest some specific guidelines to target bird species of interest  both inside and outside of urban areas. For example, if increasing numbers of migratory  species is of primary concern, then conservation areas should be located outside of urban  boundaries or in areas with low road density. However, if maximizing species richness is  the focus, location of the conservation area may not be as important if the conservation area  is surrounded by at least 50 m of forest habitat in all directions.

AB  - The current trend towards promoting the conservation of ecosystems has resulted in various studies conducted to determine ways to establish an ecological network. As such, urban ecological networks challenge popular perceptions regarding green space planning and protection. They also emphasize the importance of green spaces as parts of an interconnected system for sustainable urban development. However, until now urban ecological networks have not been applied in urban planning.As a result, this study developed an urban ecological network planning (UENP) method based on urban ecology and landscape ecology theory in order to improve the stability of urban ecosystems. First, the evolving definition of an ecological network was examined. Next, the UENP model was established with a focus on green space and land management. Finally, as a case study, a UENP for northeastern cities within the Seoul Metropolitan Area was conducted.Policy implications of these results are also presented. The UENP developed in this study consists of three stages of analysis: 1) green space assessment for urban ecological stability, naturalness, and biodiversity with consideration to development risks; 2) development of an urban ecological network using least-cost path analysis; and 3) examination results with a land use plan to minimize possible conflict. As an approach in urban sustainability, the UENP suggested in this study can be applied to urban green network planning and be used to control urban sprawl and promote biodiversity. © 2012 The Society of Urban Technology.

This paper reviews the latest use of smart cards in securing network, online services, operating systems, and card-holder identity. Smart card network authentication is routinely used on GSM and 3G networks, and this paper shows how the same infrastructure can be extended to perform WiFi access point authentication. Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication. Finally, the paper will show how smart cards and trusted platform module have complementary roles for recuring the operating systems, and the use of smart cards in identity frameworks such as liberty alliance or Microsoft cardspace.

AB  - This paper demonstrates how social network analysis can support talent management initiatives in knowledge-intensive work environments. Drawing on network analysis and interview data from the R&D division of two European-based multinational firms, this paper illustrates how social network analysis can aid talent management interventions on two fronts: (a) through talent positioning, i.e. having the right talent at the right place at the right time, and (b) responding to a talent raid, i.e. a sudden exodus of star performers. These findings show that talent management efforts not only need to go beyond identifying key positions but also need to consider the connections between the individuals occupying complementary key positions. This paper contributes to the advancement of the talent management concept by integrating a social network perspective into the research agenda. The extant literature has tended to focus upon the individuals' attributes when deciding who is to be deemed `talented'. In contrast, social network theory posits that it is the ties and relationships between individuals - and not individual attributes - that really matter.

How to interpret the shape of a sand dune? This collective book written for the non-specialist addresses these questions and more generally, the fundamental issue of the emergence of forms and patterns in physical and living systems. It is a single book gathering the different aspects of morphogenesis and approaches developed in different disciplines on shape and pattern formation. Relying on the seminal works of D Arcy Thompson, Alan Turing and René Thom, it confronts major examples like plant growth and shape, intra-cellular organization, evolution of living forms or motifs generated by crystals. A book essential to understand universal principles at work in the shapes and patterns surrounding us but also to avoid spurious analogies.

AB  - Efforts to make digital transactions secure are often necessary but never suf- ficient enough to increase the willingness of the transaction partners to actually carry out the transaction. As we shall see in section 2, besides security two more requirements have to be fulfilled in order to increase this willingness. First of all, the measures for the reduction of insecurity must be noticed by the transac- tion partners and they have to become familiar with them TaThOO. Second, there always remains a residual insecurity which can be compensated for only by building up trust in the partner and in the IT-system used. At the moment, the first signals of a beginning paradigm shift can be detect- ed: thinking in the dimension of security is followed by thinking about the factor of trust as the ultimate and decisive indicator for the willingness to actually car- ry out transactions in the network economy. This paradigm shift is characterized by the following corner-stones : the belief in the sufficiency of objective technical and legal security is fol- lowed by an increasing interest in the question of what actually determines the users' trust in digital transactions and how it develops, the assumption that security building components (SBCs) also increase the subjectively perceived security is followed by efforts to increase trust in se- curity building components and in the corresponding transaction partner by trust building components (TBCs) and finally, the point of view that security is something that a system should have to the highest possible extent is followed by the perspective that trust can be con- sidered as an essential source of sustainable competitive advantages. In the future, it might well be necessary that progress in the development and the use of trust building components at least catches up with the progress in security building components, so that the possibilities of the network economy can actu- ally be fully exhausted and that businesses are able to build up sustainable com- petitive advantages. A closer look at this situation leaves one with the impression that by far not all of the relevant dimensions of trust in digital transactions have been equally put on the research and development agenda and therefore existing solution ap- proaches cannot be as efficient as one hoped they would be. Thus, the second chapter of the present paper tries to show the complex in- terrelation between benefit, insecurity and trust with the willingness to actually carry out a digital transaction. The third chapter classifies existing control sys- tems for security building, whereas the fourth chapter classifies measures for trust building. This classification includes current fields of research, products, legislative actions, committees and a survey of the literature. The fifth and final chapter depicts ways to implement the paradigm shift.

AB  - Research on individual social capital and physical activity has tended to focus on the association among physical activity, generalized trust, and social participation. Less is known about the association between network social capital, i.e., the resources accessed through one's social connections, and physical inactivity. Using formal network measures of social capital, this study examined which specific dimension of network capital (i.e. diversity, reach and range) was associated with physical inactivity, and whether network social capital mediated the association between physical inactivity and social participation. Data came from the 2008 Montreal (Canada) Neighbourhood Networks and Healthy Aging survey, in which 2707 adults 25 years and older in 300 Montreal neighbourhoods were surveyed. Physical activity was self-reported using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). IPAQ guidelines provided the basis for the physical inactivity cutoff. Network social capital was measured with a position generator instrument. Multilevel logistic methods were used to examine the association between physical inactivity and individual social capital dimensions, while adjusting for socio-demographic and -economic factors. Higher network diversity was associated with a decreased likelihood of physical inactivity. Consistent with previous findings, individuals who did not participate in any formal associations were more likely to be physically inactive compared to those with high levels of participation. Network diversity mediated the association between physical inactivity and participation. Generalized trust and the network components of reach and range were not shown associated with physical inactivity. Findings highlight the importance of social participation and network social capital and the added value of network measures in the study of social capital and physical inactivity. Population-based programs targeting physical inactivity among adults might consider ecological-level interventions that leverage associational involvement and interpersonal relationships to improve population-level physical activity.

This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system. In addition to these nonspatial goals, objectives concerning the spatial distrib...

AB  - Network analysis (NA) is a set of integrated techniques to depict relations among actors and to analyze the social structures that emerge from the recurrence of these relations. The basic assumption is that better explanations of social phenomena are yielded by analysis of the relations among entities. This analysis is conducted by collecting relational data organized in matrix form. If actors are depicted as nodes, and their relations as lines among pairs of nodes, the concept of social network changes from being a metaphor to an operative analytical tool which utilizes the mathematical language of graph theory and of matrix and relational algebra. Although deterministic approaches usually emphasise that NA enables study of how the social structure of relationships around a person, group, or organization affects behaviors and attitudes, structurally bounded purposive actions may affect the social structure and vice versa. NA can be regarded as a set of techniques with a shared methodological perspective, rather than as a new paradigm in the social sciences. NA techniques allow researchers to specify empirical indicators and to control field hypotheses through the definition and measurement of traditional catch-all concepts like social structure and cohesion.

AB  - As a typical social media in Web 2.0, blogs have attracted a surge of researches. Unlike the traditional studies, the social networks mined from Internet are very large, which makes a lot of social network analyzing algorithms to be intractable. According to this phenomenon, this paper addresses the novel problem of efficient social networks analyzing on blogs. This paper turns to account the structural characteristics of real large-scale complex networks, and proposes a novel shortest path approximate algorithm to calculate the distance and shortest path between nodes efficiently. The approximate algorithm then is incorporated with social network analysis algorithms and measurements for large-scale social networks analysis. We illustrate the advantages of the approximate analysis through the centrality measurements and community mining algorithms. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on blogs, which indicates the necessity of taking account of the structural characteristics of complex networks when optimizing the analysis algorithms on large-scale social networks.

AB  - Cnidarians are primitive multi-cellular animals whose body is constructed of two epithelial layers and whose gastric cavity has only one opening. Most cnidarians are colonial. Colonial hydroids with their branched body can be regarded as a model for the whole phylum and are the most-studied cnidarian group with respect to developmental biology. Their colonies are constructed by repetition of limited number of developmental modules. The new modules are formed in the course of activity of terminal elements – growing tips of stolons and shoots. The growing tips of cnidarians, in contrast to those of plants, lack cell proliferation and drive morphogenesis instead by laying down and shaping the outer skeleton and formation of the new colony elements. Cell multiplication takes place proximally to the growing tips. Branching in colonial hydroids happens due to the emergence of the new growing tip within the existing structures or by subdivision of the growing tip into several rudi- ments. Marcomorphogenetic events associated with different variants of branching are de- scribed, and the problems of pattern control are discussed in brief. Less is known about genetic basis of branching control.

AB  - Social Network Analysis (SNA) involves the study of the structure and composition of networks that, in turn, is useful for understanding the implications of patterns and relationships among social entities. The focus of SNA is based on relationships within a network rather than the influence and characteristics of individuals within a network. Four key features of SNA are the structure of the social ties, systematic data, graphic representation, and mathematical or computational models. Examples of network structures and graphic representations are provided. This article provides an overview of SNA; it looks at some studies of SNA with indigenous and minority groups; it explores the use of social networks within a Kaupapa Māori analysis; and gives preliminary consideration as to whether SNA may be useful as a method for analysing social networks with Māori collectives. The article also raises considerations for future research using SNA such as who benefits from the knowledge that analysing Māori social networks brings about; what is the use of internet among Māori and to what extent do Māori use internet-based social networking tools; and will SNA enhance our ability to anticipate, understand and explain the relationship between social networks and whānau ora (wellbeing).

AB  - Social network analysts study the structural patterning of the ties that link social actors. For the most part, they seek to uncover two kinds of patterns: (1) those that reveal subsets of actors that are organized into cohesive social groups, and (2) those that reveal subsets of actors that occupy equivalent social positions, or roles. To uncover patterns of those kinds, network analysts collect and examine data on actor-to-actor ties. Such data record who is connected to whom and/or how closely they are connected. Typically, the data are organized into square, N-dimensional, N- by-N matrices, where the N rows and the N columns both refer to the social actors being studied. Cell entries in these matrices indicate either the presence/absence or the strength of some social relationship linking the row actor to the column actor. In this chapter, we deal only with symmetric relationships where, given a connection from actor i to actor j, actor j is also connected to i in the same way. Network analysts sometimes use standard statistical procedures in examining their actor-by-actor matrices. Although there are several statistical modeling tools that have been developed specifically for network data (Holland and Leinhardt 1981;Wasserman and Pattison 1996), these tools were designed primarily for testing hypotheses. They do not provide a simple direct way to explore the patterning of network data – one that will permit an investigator to “see” groups and positions. Visual images can be used to examine the patterning of network data. In an earlier paper (Freeman 2000), I reviewed the history of the use of visual images in social network analysis. In this chapter, I show how to use images in an exploratory way to learn something about the properties of a network data set. The next section introduces some ways to create visual images that can be used to display the kinds of structure of interest to network analysts. Then the following section will showhowthose images can be adapted to help to uncover both the antecedents and the consequences of observed network structure.

AB  - It is an ongoing trend that people increasingly reveal very personal information on social network sites in particular and in the World Wide Web in general (Boyd & Ellison, 2007; Donath & Boyd, 2004; Hangwoo, 2006; Joinson, 2001; Ralph, Alessandro, & H. John Heinz, 2005). As this information becomes more and more publicly available from these various social network sites and the web in general, the social relationships between people can be discoverd and allows the automatic extraction of social networks. This trend is furthermore driven and enforced by recent initiatives such as facebooks connect , Myspaces data availability and Googles FriendConnect by making their social network data available to anyone. Furthermore the current development of the World Wide Web, termed as Web 2.0 by OReilly (O'Reilly, 2005), enables increasingly more people to publish information without profound technical knowledge. Blogs have gained a lot of attention in recent years. The whole blogosphere including more than 60 million blogs (Sifry, 2007) forms a reasonable body of information and knowledge. Additionally hypertext links made between blogs have been described as conversation, affiliation, or readership, implying a form of implicit social structure (Adamic & Adar, 2003; Flake, Lawrence, & Giles, 2000; Gibson, Kleinberg, & Raghavan, 1998; Herring et al., 2005; Kumar, Novak, Raghavan, & Tomkins, 2004; Marlow, 2006). That means that the publicly available information is increasingly annotated with author information which too allows the extraction of social networks. Although there is an increasing interest about social networks in general, there is little attention about the application of social network analysis to information retrieval systems. Recent studies (Borgatti & Foster, 2003; Cross, Borgatti, & Parker, 2001) suggest that the social network of a person has a significant impact on his or her information acquisition. Therefore the paper proposes the application of available social network data in the context of information retrieval systems. An outline of the research design for the exploration of meaningful sources for social network extraction and the impact of meaningful social network analysis methods and measures in the context of information retrieval systems will be given. The evaluation of these methods and measures is conducted on scientificcommons.org, a search platform for open access publications with 19 million publications and 7.9 million extracted authors and their co-author network.

Instead of discussing contributions purely along traditional linguistic or disciplinary lines, the authors use a novel classification scheme to identify and categorize significant works according to their particular epistemological perspective, before describing noteworthy contributions of various academic disciplines by key authors and research themes. The most significant contributions to the study of urban form in Canada have come from two largely isolated camps: first, architects/planners, mostly from Quebec, who examine form as a relatively independent system and work in the tradition of the so-called Italian school of process typology; and secondly, predominantly anglophone urban and historical geographers who deal with built forms and urban morphogenesis as a product of external forces. Recent work suggests that the two solitudes may be coming together.

AB  - This paper re-examines the question of the social “fabric” of urban neighborhoods on the basis of residents' personal networks. Data were collected on the number, relative intimacy, and spatial distribution of social relationships among residents of two ethnically homogenous and two ethnically heterogenous neighborhoods in a medium-sized city in the midwestern United States. The analysis focused on spatial distributions and variables associated with differences in the average number or intimacy of neighborhood network ties. Herbert Gans had predicted that in heterogenous neighborhoods residential proximity would be a less important factor in social network formation than has previously been reported for socially homogeneous residential settings (especially Festinger et al. 1950). The results from this study indicated that the effects of proximity were more, rather than less, reflected in the spatial distribution of social relationships in the ethnically heterogenous neighborhoods. The face-block was identified as an important socio-spatial unit in all four neighborhoods.

AB  - The emergence of Online Social Network Sites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter has dramatically changed the way in which users of such networks interact with their social environment. They share, more or less consciously, a large portion of their social life with millions of other users and, reciprocally, gain insight to the social activities of their friends, friends-of-friends and complete strangers. Online Social Network Sites became platforms for gossip and matchmaking, channels for personal and mass communication, mediators of preferences, opinions and lifestyles. They extended the social sphere form the physical to the virtual and consolidated millions of fragmented lives in networks that cross many - if not all - cultural, professional, political and geographical boundaries. While social uses and users have catalysed the proliferation of Online Social Network Sites and still dominate their content and traffic, there is also considerable potential for a wide range of professional applications. The typical Online Social Network infrastructure has the capacity to facilitate and coordinate work processes in a globalised world and enhance communication and governance mechanisms across geographical distance, cultural and professional diversity (Faraj & Wasko, 2001). Online networks can provide a platform not only for social exchange, but for exchange of knowledge, experience and expertise in a professional context. This paper is structured around Piotr Sztompka's theory of social change and his concept of social becoming (1994) visualized in Figure 1. After a brief section with definitions and disambiguation of important terms and concepts, Section 3 will provide an overview of the scientific literature dealing with the theoretical background and potentialities of Online Social Network-mediated knowledge exchange. Section 4 will then turn to actualities and empirical findings in scientific literature of pragmatic applications, before Section 5 will contrast these insights with some observations of the HELP Forum, an Online Social Network Site which aims at facilitating knowledge exchange among the members of UNESCOs Hydrology for the Environment, Life and Policy (HELP) programme. Finally, some lessons and best practices for the management and use of the HELP Forum will be drawn together with the hope of incubating the HELP community with a better understanding of the potentialities of online cooperation and exchange.

Notwithstanding the fact that online social networks have utterly revolution- ised social interaction, this new environment can facilitate new forms of social deviance and criminality. Its ability to collapse the conventional social barriers that govern sexual behaviour has compounded this situation, presenting new opportunities for sexual expression and deviance both to young people and to adults with a sexual interest in this group. This has resulted in a very real series of risks to the welfare of young people that socialise in this environment. To date, the safeguards we have set in place have not had

AB  - The mechanisms, by which organ complexity increases during evolution, are poorly understood. Although all vertebrate lungs mediate gas exchange using specialized cells generated by an alveolar differentiation program, their complexity ranges from the two-tube amphibian lung to the tree-like mammalian lung. Little is known about how branching morphogenesis, a newly-evolved process that builds the airway tree, integrates with the ancestral alveolar differentiation program. Here we show that a Sox9 gene network regulates lung complexity by integrating morphogenesis and differentiation during the development and evolution of the lung. In the mouse lung, Sox9 mediates the Fgf/Kras branching signal and suppresses precocious alveolar differentiation. This Sox9 gene network is absent in the Xenopus lung where there is no branching morphogenesis and all epithelial cells undergo alveolar differentiation. We propose that such dual-function gene networks are evolutionary advancements to increase organ complexity by delaying ancestral programs and promoting the integration of new programs.

AB  - An introductory level chapter. Cell migration is an important aspect of animal development, especially of vertebrates. Coalescence (convergent migration) of cells can drive morphogenesis—for example, in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum or the formation of the great blood vessels of vertebrates. Translocation and migration is also common—for example, of primordial germ cells and neural crest cells, while some cells (neurons) send out migratory cell processes. In all of these cases, migration is not random but guided, cells navigating in response to diffusible substances, surface-bound molecules, mechanical forces or electric fields. Responses to guidance factors are cell type-specific, so that different cells can interpret the same cue in different ways.

Many people, especially poor and disadvantaged people, do not have their tenure relations to land included in a formal administration system with women, in particular, more likely to be excluded from such a system. Without recognized tenure rights, the poor lose the associated benefi ts such as: 1) improved tenure security; 2) increased investment in the land; 3) increased land value and marketability; 4) increased access to credit; and 5) fewer disputes and forced evictions. Also, local (and national) governments would not be able to better manage land use and development, and mobilize resources. © UN-Habitat / Danilo Antonio

AB  - A Social network is a social structure made up of individuals called nodes which are tied by edges. One example of a source for social network analysis is traffic in a mobile telephony network where the subscribers are nodes and the edges are derived from the telecom traffic in the mobile telephony network. Mobile networks and other social networks of today contain millions of subscribers and the growth is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Many of the social network analysis algorithms are considered to be computationally expensive to execute. In this paper we describe the analysis and conclusions from our studies related to scalability for social network analysis algorithms. For some algorithms scalability is improved by introducing approximations in the existing algorithms. Many social network algorithms perform the analysis globally on the complete network. By performing the analysis for the closest neighbors to the target node, the ego network, the scalability is improved. Solutions for parallelized execution of the algorithms are also described. The most challenging part was to efficiently partition the network in smaller segments to prepare for parallel execution of the algorithms. A novel idea for handling pre- partitioning based on geographic location of the subscribers in a mobile network is described. As a proof of concept a prototype was implemented. Evaluation of our prototype implementation and ideas for further improvements are also described. Performance tests to compare the original with the improved social network algorithms and the parallelized solutions shows considerable improvements related to scalability. The trade off between capacity and quality of the results for these solutions and algorithms is also evaluated.

AB  - The distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (= serotonin = 5-HT) and noradrenalin (NA) in the enteric plexuses of the rat ileum was studied using immunocytochemical techniques. 5-HT-like immunoreactive fibers were observed only in the myenteric plexus, surrounding the ganglionic cells, which are all unreactive. NA-like immunoreactive fibers were present in all layers of the ileum: in the myenteric plexus, they were localized in the nodes, forming a network all round the neuronal perikarya; in the Meissner plexus, positive axons were arranged in a delicate network; submucosal blood vessels were often provided by NA-immunopositive nerve plexus. In the inner circular muscle layer the immunoreactive NA-positive fibers run within nerve bundles mainly parallel with the smooth muscle cells. The 5-HT immunoreactive material was depleted by treatment with reserpine; depletion of NA by 6-hydroxy-dopamine was also observed; on the contrary, no depletion of 5-HT by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine was obtained. To confirm the validity of these results, specific antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic 1-aminoacid-decarboxylase (AADC), two enzymes involved in the synthesis of catecholamines, were used. In conclusion these experiments indicate that 5-HT is present, probably as a transmitter, in certain fibres of the rat myenteric plexus, distributed in a way similar to that of NA-containing fibers. However, at variance with NA fibers, 5-HT fibers are not present in other regions of the intestine wall.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has important health-related consequences and numerous biological and social determinants. OBJECTIVE: To explore quantitatively whether alcohol consumption behavior spreads from person to person in a large social network of friends, coworkers, siblings, spouses, and neighbors, followed for 32 years. DESIGN: Longitudinal network cohort study. SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study. PARTICIPANTS: 12 067 persons assessed at several time points between 1971 and 2003. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks per week on average over the past year and number of days drinking within the past week) and social network ties, measured at each time point. RESULTS: Clusters of drinkers and abstainers were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to 3 degrees of separation. These clusters were not only due to selective formation of social ties among drinkers but also seem to reflect interpersonal influence. Changes in the alcohol consumption behavior of a person's social network had a statistically significant effect on that person's subsequent alcohol consumption behavior. The behaviors of immediate neighbors and coworkers were not significantly associated with a person's drinking behavior, but the behavior of relatives and friends was. LIMITATIONS: A nonclinical measure of alcohol consumption was used. Also, it is unclear whether the effects on long-term health are positive or negative, because alcohol has been shown to be both harmful and protective. Finally, not all network ties were observed. CONCLUSION: Network phenomena seem to influence alcohol consumption behavior. This has implications for clinical and public health interventions and further supports group-level interventions to reduce problematic drinking.

AB  - The proliferation of the Web has led to the simultaneous explosive growth of both textual and link information. Many techniques have been developed to cope with this information explosion phenomenon. Early efforts include the development of non-Bayesian Web community discovery methods that exploit only link information to identify groups of topical coherent Web pages. Most non-Bayesian methods produce hard clustering results and cannot provide semantic interpretation. Recently, there has been growing interest in applying Bayesian-based approaches to discovering Web community. The Bayesian approaches for Web community discovery possess many good characteristics such as soft clustering results and ability to provide semantic interpretation of the extracted communities. This chapter presents a systematic survey and discussions of non-Bayesian and Bayesian-based approaches to the Web community discovery problem. © 2013, IGI Global.

AB  - The advent of online social networks has been one of the most exciting events in this decade. Many popular online social networks such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook have become increasingly popular. In addition, a number of multimedia networks such as Flickr have also seen an increasing level of popularity in recent years. Many such social networks are extremely rich in content, and they typically contain a tremendous amount of content and linkage data which can be leveraged for analysis. The linkage data is essentially the graph structure of the social network and the communications between entities; whereas the content data contains the text, images and other multimedia data in the network. The richness of this network provides unprecedented opportunities for data analytics in the context of social networks. This book provides a data-centric view of online social networks; a topic which has been missing from much of the literature. This chapter provides an overview of the key topics in this field, and their coverage in this book.

AB  - In recent years, network behaviour has been analysed extensively as the emerging model for economic growth. By network behaviour, a metaphor for co-operative behaviour among individuals, corporate or territorial partners is intended. This is increasingly becoming the reference paradigm in an era of continuing innovation and fast technological change, in the presence of 'market failure' where dynamic and innovative behaviours are concerned and of the high costs of a growth strategy based solely on internal know-how. The theory of the city network paradigm claims that, through participation in the network, cities exploit scale economies in complementary relationships and synergies in co-operative activities. In this sense, network advantage is a real club good, achieved only by those economic actors who are partners in the economic and spatial network, and is distributed among partners despite the private marginal costs each partner bears to participate in the network. In this sense, the private marginal costs of network participation differ from private marginal benefits, and network advantages turn out to be network externalities. The aim of the present paper is to measure the impacts that city network behaviour has on city performance-i.e. to provide a quantitative measurement of network externalities stemming from network behaviour in territorial systems.

AB  - This paper discusses the local planning of sustainable development in terms of urban governance. It is particularly interested to examine the grounds for the legitimacy of different actors and the process of legitimation in one urban network. Legitimation is understood here as a discursive process of acceptance in which the actors involved locate themselves and others in the structures of governance. The results indicate that people from the local community and local government justify their positions in the urban governance network and policy-making by means of traditional forms of authorisation - namely, in terms of expertise, representation or the common good. These characteristics have traditionally given legitimacy to the activities and decisions taken by public administration and government. In the case at hand, the traditional grounds for legitimacy are transformed into network-based practices, but those grounds are not pre-given for any of the parties involved. The future challenge in urban governance is to enable the formation of new kinds of political identities that are suitable for governance networks by reforming local discursive practices.

AB  - On one hand, there really isn't anything about social network data that is all that unusual. Networkers do use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets of observations that they use. But, network data can also be described and understood using the ideas and concepts of more familiar methods, like cross-sectional survey research. On the other hand, the data sets that networkers develop usually end up looking quite different from the conventional rectangular data array so familiar to survey researchers and statistical analysts. The differences are quite important because they lead us to look at our data in a different way -- and even lead us to think differently about how to apply statistics.

AB  - In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published Journal Citation Report (JCR). Although this data cover most of the important journals, it lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings, which results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries (DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First, conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third, experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.

AB  - This study explores the limiting properties of network-wide traffic flow relations under heavily congested conditions in a large-scale complex urban street network; these limiting conditions are emulated in the context of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) experiments on an actual large network. The primary objectives are to characterize gridlock and understand its dynamics. This study addresses a gap in the literature with regard to the existence of exit flow and recovery period. The one-dimensional theoretical Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) only represents steady-state behavior and holds only when the inputs change slowly in time and traffic is distributed homogenously in space. Also, it does not describe the hysteretic behavior of the network traffic when a gridlock forms or when network recovers. Thus, a model is proposed to reproduce hysteresis and gridlock when homogeneity and steady-state conditions do not hold. It is conjectured that the network average flow can be approximated as a non-linear function of network average density and variation in link densities. The proposed model is calibrated for the Chicago Central Business District (CBD) network. We also show that complex urban networks with multiple route choices, similar to the idealized network tested previously in the literature, tend to jam at a range of densities that are smaller than the theoretical average network jam density. Also it is demonstrated that networks tend to gridlock in many different ways with different configurations. This study examines how mobility of urban street networks could be improved by managing vehicle accumulation and redistributing network traffic via strategies such as demand management and disseminating real-time traveler information (adaptive driving). This study thus defines and explores some key characteristics and dynamics of urban street network gridlocks including gridlock formation, propagation, recovery, size, etc. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An illustrious scientist who was never really sure whether he was the author of his own works! Such was the impression D’Arcy Thompson gave when he presented his results. He compared them to the observations of his predecessors, as one should, but without really highlighting those points that would assure him priority. If an idea came into his head that he found interesting, it was as if, deep inside, a voice whispered to him that others had already had the same idea, maybe long ago. He searched for the source of the idea in more or less recent conversations with his family and friends, or buried himself in his books, including Ancient Greek literature, in which he was an eminent specialist at an early age, while his profession was teaching natural history to the students of Dundee University in Scotland. His biology lectures were well-researched and constituted the point of departure for profound reflections in the domains of mathematics, physics and chemistry, not to mention historical references ranging from Plato to Galileo or other, more recent authors [8, 11, 41]. This all bears witness to a fine eclecticism, the multiple facets of which have been rediscovered over the last forty years [3, 20, 36].

AB  - According to the morphological radiation principle (or the principle of initial morphological diversity) in the process of formation of new systems of an organism all functionally significant types of their organization that are possible on a definite morphological basis are formed and various inter-system connections are easily attained. Not infrequently a group solves new biological task owing to organs arising from different sources. An efficient method to reveal this regularity is to compare morphological differences in taxa of the same rank and the same phylogenetic stock. The highest morphological diversity (constructive diversity) is observed in groups in the basis of large phylogenetic branches, here differences can involve the basic plan of a certain phylum and types of morphogenesis characteristic of it.

A network model is used to assess the nature of change in intercity relations from 2000 to 2004. Data are collected for 2004 on the office networks of the same global service firms that were used to describe global connectivities for 315 cities in 2000. This allows a new cross-sectional geography of connectivities to be produced for 2004, and for changes in connectivities between 2000 and 2004 to be computed. Simple visualization and statistical techniques are used to explore the data. A distinction is made between ‘normal change’ and ‘exceptional change’ and only two cases of the latter are definitely identified: cities in both the USA and sub-Saharan Africa are generally losing global connectivity in relation to the rest of the world. Thus ‘normal change’ predominates and the paper concludes that contemporary intercity change does not correspond to Castells' image of an ‘urban roller coaster’. Taylor P. J. et ARANYA R.

There are two longitudinal nerve tracts which run all along the margin of the pineal organ from its distal to proximal regions. These nerve tracts are confluent distally. Another short, but deep tract was seen in the middle part of the pineal organ which joins one of these tracts. A large number of AChE-positive neurons whose processes actually form the tracts are present all along the pineal organ. They are distinguished into multipolar and pseudounipolar/unipolar neurons. A few neurons seen outside the nerve tract form a network of nerve fibres among the pinealocytes and also link the main tracts. The nerve tracts appear wavy, irregular and tortuous. A large number of round ring-like bodies seen in close association with neuronal perikarya and nerves may represent the axo-somatic and axo-dendritic contacts.

AB  - Aloe vera has been used worldwide both for pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries due to the plethora of biological activities of some of its metabolites. A study case is reported focusing on the development of a cloning protocol of A. vera to provide propagation material with superior quality to the private sector in southern Brazil, i.e., A. vera juice industry. Such biotechnological approach afforded ca. 4,300 plantlets from 20 explants, over a 6-month period, overcoming the drawback of the lack of propagation material. Typically, the results have led to the increase of the cultured area and juice production of that species coming true the goal of the partnership between the public and private sectors herein involved. The transference of the resulting technology was successfully performed to the company and a patent covering the biotechnological process has been recently requested to official organisms on behalf of the partners.

These improvements include turn-tables, dynamic segmentation, linear referencing, traffic lines and nonplanar networks. The chapter shifts attention also to network routing problems that have become prominent in GIS-T: the traveling-salesman problem, the vehicle-routing problem and the shortest-path problem with time windows, a problem that occurs as a subproblem in many time-constrained routing and scheduling issues of practical importance.

AB  - With the development of the urban social economy in China, the uncertain factors faced by urban network planners and their complexity are continuously increasing. In order to promote the scientific nature of urban network planning in China, the risks of urban network planning need to be identified and analysed systemically. Questionnaires about the risks of urban network planning in China were designed from the perspectives of policy, technology, economics and management. The membership degree of possibility, loss value and expected loss which affect the risks of the urban network planning in China were determined, based on the theory of fuzzy membership through statistical investigation and analysis. Key factors that should be considered in the future were determined. Those factors mainly include whether the government supports the urban power network plan, increases in the cost of levy land and immigration, grid project quality risk management, the deviation of load forecasting and so on. The method improves the comprehensiveness and objectivity of risk identification and provides a decision foundation for the risk aversion of urban power network planning in the developing countries.

AB  - The word ‘ganyu’ is widely used in Malawi to describe a range of short-term rural labour relationships, the most common of which is piecework weeding or ridging on the fields of other smallholders, or on agricultural estates. Ganyu is a crucial poverty issue in Malawi because: • After own-farm production, ganyu is the most important source of livelihood for most poor households – for some it is becoming even more important than own-farm production. • Ganyu is the most important coping strategy for most poor households in the crucial hungry period between food stores running out and the next harvest. • The need to do ganyu to obtain an immediate supply of food may conflict with own-farm production and therefore, while addressing an immediate crisis, can lock some households into a vicious cycle of food insecurity. • Low ganyu wage rates mean agricultural labourers do not earn sufficient incomes to invest in sustainable livelihood development. Despite the widespread practice of ganyu, and its importance to the poor, it is an under-researched component of the jigsaw that makes up the livelihoods of rural Malawians. This is a mistake, as ganyu is too important to the poor to be sidelined – it will play a critical role in future rural development strategies and has important interactions with the current debate about developing safety nets in Malawi. The paper discusses recent literature on ganyu and opens up a debate about various future scenarios and how different strategies may affect rural labour markets.

AB  - The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

AB  - Adjacency relations for social network analysis have usually been tackled in their bidimensional form, in the sense that relations are computed over pairs of objects. Nevertheless, this paper considers the bidimensional case as restrictive and it proposes an approach where the dimension of the analysis is not limited to binary relations. With the aid of fuzzy logic and OWA operators, it is showed that the interpretation of m-ary adjacency relations is the same of binary relations and therefore they can consistently be employed in social network analysis and some novel results be derived. Besides justifying the use of m-ary relations, the paper proposes a way to characterize them and, eventually, it will provide the reader with an example section.

AB  - What's different about social network data? On one hand, there really isn't anything about social network data that is all that unusual. Networkers do use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets of observations that they use. But, network data can also be described and understood using the ideas and concepts of more familiar methods, like cross-sectional survey research. On the other hand, the data sets that networkers develop usually end up looking quite different from the conventional rectangular data array so familiar to survey researchers and statistical analysts. The differences are quite important because they lead us to look at our data in a different way - and even lead us to think differently about how to apply statistics.

AB  - Scenario and gaming techniques have a number of complementary characteristics. In this article, the design and evaluation of a gaming-scenario experiment for the exploration of development planning in an urban network in the Netherlands is presented. Two gaming sessions were held using two long-term scenarios (2030) as varying contexts. The combined gaming-scenario approach made it possible to evaluate the impact of external future developments and trends on the administrative and spatial development. Evaluation results of the gaming experiment indicate that the gaming-scenario approach generated new and critical insights on development planning and the future of the urban network. Through the game, the principal, the game leaders but most of all the stakeholder-participants experienced and realized that the management of development planning in urban networks is a very difficult task and is full of pitfalls. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Older traditions of enterprise and participation in higher education have proved stronger factors in development than the level of investment inherited from state socialism.The authors explore the different strands of agricultural transformation, and of industrial change, which is even more spatially diversified, and more open to the impact of internationalization. They emphasize the links between regions and foreign markets, a relationship which has been neglected by most researchers.

We ordinarily repre- sent filiation by a set of arcs (descent arcs) that are directed from parents to children, and marriage by a set of undirected edges (marriage edges) between spouses (for alternative representations of kinship networks without edges, see below). Kinship networks thus are mixed graphs, contain- ing both arcs and edges. Gender is usually taken into account by a partitioning of the vertex set (the gender partition), usually into two or three disjoint classes (male, female, and possibly unknown sex).

The risk landscape that this report has explored over the past five editions has in fact changed remarkably little. What has changed dramatically is the level of recognition that global risks, like the world, are now tightly interconnected and shocks and vulnerabilities are truly global, even if impact and response can still differ at the “local” level. This recognition is illustrated by the increased number of interlinkages on the 2010 Risks Interconnection Map (RIM)1.

AB  - abstractComparative studies of urbanisation can be characterized by their emphasis on the\nquantitative and visual aspects of urban growth, which is amongst other things reflected\nin the analysis of spatial patterns and rates of urban population growth. The visual aspects relate both to the spatial realisation of the demand for urban land use and its functional variation. This emphasis can be understood from the perspective\nof the ongoing process of urban industrial growth in the industrialised countries during the 19th and most of the 20th century. Most of the concept and models we use have been developed during this period of urban transition and relate to this\nexperience. However, in the last quarter of the 20th century this process came to an end as the urbanisation process in its present form was completed. This leads to the following questions. First, to what extent are the concepts and models derived throughout this period still valid? Second, if this is not the case, to what extent do\nthey need adjustment and third, what kind of new approaches are required?\nIn this paper the focus will be cities as part of an urban system and will deal with two issues, viz. the relation between spatial scales, i.e. vertical linkages and the relation between cities, especially focussed on their horizontal linkages or network characteristics. These two issues will be discussed against the background of the completion of three long-term developments: (1) the completed first demographic transition, (2) the completed process of industrialisation and (3) the completion of three infrastructural revolutions. This analysis will indicate the direction in which the environment has changed, the consequences of this change for the  conceptualisation of the process of urbanisation and for the characteristics of the process it self.\nThe consequences of these changes will be discussed using empirical examples from the Netherlands and other parts of Europe both for models of internal urban structure and for the city system at large. The classical unity between territory, economic and social functions is broken up and has lead to a decoupling of functions both in a spatial and in a functional sense. The latter has resulted in a process of spatial rebundling of activities.\nIt will be argued that new rationalities are needed to understand the contemporary realisation of the spatial outcome of the demand for space use. In addition to this, it has also been argued that new and different types of uncertainties emerge. The latter are related to the increased importance of micro processes in the demand for space use. This in turn has consequences for spatial policy, as it will lead to considerable mismatches between national planning goals and actual realisations. \nIt is suggested that a process approach is needed to deal with these uncertainties.text

AB  - A social network is a representation that describes the relationships between individuals. In recent years, several interesting phenomena, such as the densification power law, have been observed in social networks and a number of models have been proposed to explain them. In this paper, we investigate an interesting phenomenon called the seniority difference distribution of new connections, which we observed in our data. The distribution reveals that there exists a seniority preference when a new network node tries to establish connections with existing nodes. To explain the phenomenon, we propose several models based on different local selection policies, namely, equal-probability selection, freshness-based selection, oldness-based selection, and combined freshness/oldness selection. The results of simulations show that, by combining the concepts of freshness and oldness, it is possible to reproduce a social network that matches the observation. TS  - CrossRef

AB  - This chapter is a conceptual look at data quality issues that arise during scientific observations and their impact on social network analysis. We provide examples of the many types of incompleteness, bias and uncertainty that impact the quality of social network data. Our approach is to leverage the insights and experience of observational behavioral scientists familiar with the challenges of making inference when data are not complete, and suggest avenues for extending these to relational data questions. The focus of our discussion is on network data collection using observational methods because they contain high dimensionality, incomplete data, varying degrees of observational certainty, and potential observer bias. However, the problems and recommendations identified here exist in many other domains, including online social networks, cell phone networks, covert networks, and disease transmission networks.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in working with local communities to establish marine protected areas to help conserve dwindling marine resources. Given the urgent nature of this problem, it is essential that project managers and communities learn how to best apply this approach and understand the conditions1 under which this strategy will most likely achieve success. In August 2000, and again in 2003, representatives of a number projects from across the Pacific and Southeast Asia came together in Fiji and the Philippines. Each of the projects is currently using some form of a locally-managed marine area (LMMA) strategy. The meetings were designed to allow these different projects to share and discuss their experiences in using locally-managed marine areas. From these initial meetings, representatives of some of these projects have agreed to work together and form a collaborative 'learning network' so that they can systematically share their knowledge and experiences about how to use this strategy more effectively and improve their conservation impact.2 This network is called the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) Network.

AB  - Silica-based materials are used in many high-tech products including microelectronics, optoelectronics, and catalysts. Siliceous sponges (Demospongiae and Hexactinellida) are unique in their ability to synthesize silica enzymatically. We have cloned the silica-forming enzymes, silicateins, from both demosponges (marine and freshwater sponges) and hexactinellid sponges. The recombinant enzymes allow the synthesis of silica under environmentally benign ambient conditions, while the technical (chemical) production of silica commonly requires high temperatures and pressures, and extremes of pH. Silicateins can be used for the fabrication of highly- ordered inorganic–organic composite materials with defined optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. The simple self-assembly properties of silicateins which are able to form silica and other metal oxides in aqueous solution allow the development of novel products in nano(bio)technology, medicine, and dentistry.

Commercial enterprises have been quick to recognize this and are subsequently creating profiles for many of their products and services. Commercial enterprises use social network profiles to target and interact with potential customers as well as to provide a gateway for users of the product or service to interact with each other. Many commercial enterprises use the statistics from their product or service’s social network profile to tout the popularity and success of the product or service being showcased. They will use statistics such as number of friends, number of daily visits, number of interactions, and other similar measurements to quantify their claims. These statistics are often not a clear indication of the true popularity and success of the product.

AB  - From a physicist“s point of view, and regardless of the genetic controls, the branching mechanisms of many organs and glands\n  look similar. Most generally, an epithelium forms a pouch-like sheet which elongates and branches repeatedly. During the final\n  steps of organogenesis, the mesenchyme is vascularized in a pattern greatly influenced by the branched epithelium so that\n  main vessels go down (arteries) and up (veins) the main ducts towards distal branches where exchange with capillaries is performed\n  over a very large total surface area. This principle of construction can produce a secretory or filtering or breathing organ\n  and most glands and organs are built in this way. There is either a common phylogeny to all branching organs (see Chapter\n  1), or there is some simple building principle which impUes easy construction and hence straightforward evolutionary convergence\n  (Fig. 1).

AB  - (from the cover) This handbook provides an accessible introduction to the theory and practice of network analysis in the social sciences. In refreshing contrast to the existing literature, it does not use complex mathematics but introduces the reader to the general framework of network analysis, explaining the basic concepts, technical measures and available computer programs in a clear and comprehensible way. Building upon definitions of points, lines and paths, John Scott shows their use in clarifying such measures as density, fragmentation and centralization. He identifies the various cliques, components and circles into which networks are formed, and outlines an approach to the study of socially structured positions. He also discusses the use of multidimensional methods for investigating social networks. Despite a growing interest in the potential of the new techniques of social network analysis, many of the researchers who should find them useful have been daunted by the impenetrably mathematical language of their discussion. This book aims to bridge that gap between theory and practice. As well as explaining the key techniques of network analysis, it illustrates their sociological applications, using examples from major research projects. "Social Network Analysis" will be an invaluable resource for researchers in the social sciences and students of research methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)
