AB  - Achieving healthy urbanization in all countries is a global and shared responsibility. The elimination of deprived urban living conditions will require resources – aid, loans, private investments – from more affluent countries. The funding required is in the order of $200 billion per year, which is no more than 20% of the annual increase of the GDP in the high-income countries. Strong political commitment to better urban governance is crucial for the additional funds to bring about the intended improvements in living conditions and health equity. Creating global political support for a sustained and well-funded effort for social, economic and health equity is one of the greatest challenges of this generation.

AB  - Globalization and informatization have accelerated city networking process over the world, which makes research on city network a hot topic in the fields of urban geography and economic geography. With Chinese economic structure adjustment and city economic growth, producer services have begun to play an increasingly important role in city-region networking. This paper employs the methodology of world city network to analyze and explain the spatial development characteristics of China's urban network system based on the data of nationwide producer services enterprise network. The research result indicated that the distribution of producer services network has a positive effect on the development of Chinese city networks. City network connectivity is closely related to the significance of city in producer services development, and the former will gradually decline with the drop of the latter. Accordingly, the 64 cities can be divided into the national central cities, regional central cities, sub-regional central cities and local central cities in accordance with their position and role in the nationwide producer services network. It is concluded that high-grade cities with quality producer services dominate the pattern of Chinese city networks and there emerges three spatial agglomerations of producer services enterprises in Changjiang (Yangtze) River Delta, Zhujiang (Pearl) River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Economical Region. Moreover, the distribution of different producer services industry varies from city to city, which also affects the characteristics of network development.

AB  - Despite profound differences in theoretical perspectives, it is now widely accepted that under conditions of contemporary globalization key cities are (re)produced by what flows through them rather than what is fixed within them. Comparing the position of cities in the context of this "world city network" implies that relational and transnational data are required. This paper uses this starting point to contrast the connectivity profiles of U.S. cities by drawing on a unique airline dataset, which allows comparing the importance of a city's connections within and without its own country.

AB  - The effect of inhibitors of polyamine biosynthesis on the development\nof embryogenic cell cultures of celery (cv. SB 12) was studied. Several\ndevelopmental stages of somatic embryos were compared for differences\nin the content and biosynthesis of free polyamines and for cytokinin\ncontent. Cyclohexylamine and particularly methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone)\ninhibited both cell division and the organization of polar embryos\nfrom globular embryos. Difluoromethylornithine slightly promoted\nembryo development, especially cell division. The free putrescine\ncontent of globular embyros was 6-fold that of fully differentiated\nplantlets, and that of spermidine was 2-fold. Only a slight increase\nin the spermine content was found with embryo development. Incorporation\nof <sup(14)>C-arginine into polyamines was slightly higher than that\nof <sup(14)>C-ornithine. Over 96% of this incorporation was detected\nin the putrescine fraction. Incorporation of <sup(14)>C into putrescine\nin globular embryos was 3- to 4-fold that in fully-differentiated\nplantlets. Incorporation into spermidine and spermine was, however,\nhigher in plantlets. Cytokinin analysis revealed considerable differences\nin the biological activity between the developmental stages of embryogenesis.\nThis could be due to endogenous cytokinins and/or BA taken up from\nthe maintenance medium. Cytokinin levels decreased with increased\nembryo development. Most of the detected cytokinin-like activity\nco-chromatographed with BA and its metabolites. Some as yet unidentified\npeaks of activity were recorded in the globular embryos. It is suggested\nthat the onset of embryogenesis is characterized by a high content\nof putrescine and cytokinins, while a decrease in putrescine synthesis\nand cytokinin content, and an increase in spermidine and spermine\ncontent, accompany further embyro development and plantlet formation.

AB  - This paper presents an examination of the empirical merits of a set of spatial interaction indices for measuring hierarchical differentiation (i.e. dominance and connectivity) in a spatial network. To allow for the comparison of the degree of hierarchical differentiation in networks with different numbers of nodes/links, we propose to normalize the ratio between the real measures and the corresponding values for a rank size distribution in order to obtain readily interpretable measures of hierarchical differentiation. When applied to data on air passenger flows within Europe, the normalized indices, interpreted together, appear to give a good idea of the tendency toward hierarchical differentiation. The potential usefulness of this analytical framework is discussed in the context of studies on (transnational) inter-city relations and empirical assessments of changes in the spatial configuration of airline networks.

AB  - The global economy is nurturing an innovative class of polycentric urban configurations: network cities. A network city evolves when two or more previously independent cities, potentially complementary in function, strive to cooperate and achieve significant scope economies aided by fast and reliable corridors of transport and communications infrastructure. Creative network cities place a higher priority on knowledge-based activities like research, education and the creative arts. The cooperative mechanisms may resemble those of inter-firm networks in the sense that each urban player stands to benefit from the synergies of interactive growth via reciprocity, knowledge exchange and unexpected creativity. Two case studies are discussed briefly—Randstad Holland and Kansai, Japan. Since much of their future dynamism may rely upon transnational human resources, it is foreseen that more network cities will transcend national borders during the next millennium.

Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results.

The relevance of such an analysis is discussed against the conceptual backdrop of the world city network literature. It is argued that a focus on the globalisation of the IFS sector may provide an alternative to hegemonic geographical imaginations of world city-formation through its focus on other forms of globalising economic processes and regions that do not commonly feature in this literature. Based on information on the location strategies of 28 leading IFS firms in 64 cities across the world, we analyse different features of this decentred global urban geography. Manama is hereby identified as the Mecca of the IFS sector, while other major Gulf cities such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi are also primary nodes in this urban network. Other major Middle East North Africa (MENA) cities such as Tehran follow suit, but also more traditional financial centres such as London are well connected.

AB  - Cultural planning is a process of inclusive community consultation and decision- making that helps local government identify cultural resources and think strategically about how these resources can help a community to achieve its civic goals. It is also a strategic approach that directly and indirectly integrates the community’s cultural resources into a wide range of local government planning activities. The term cultural planning is relatively new, emerging out of Europe in the 1960s and 1970s as cities and towns faced changing economies and demographics. As part of European urban regeneration strategies, cultural planning integrated the arts into other aspects of local culture and into the texture and routines of daily life in the city. Today, communities around the world are actively engaged in cultural planning and nurturing cultural development. Cultural planning is a way of looking at all aspects of a community’s cultural life as community assets. Cultural planning considers the increased and diversified benefits these assets could bring to the community in the future, if planned for strategically. Understanding culture and cultural activity as resources for human and community development, rather than merely as cultural “products” to be subsidized because they are good for us, unlocks possibilities of inestimable value. And when our understanding of culture is inclusive and broader than the traditionally Eurocentric vision of “high culture,” then we have increased the assets with which we can address civic goals.

AB  - The Chinese economy has experienced substantial development over the last thirty years. This growth has resulted in an enormous expansion of China's urban areas and it has also led to a growing scarcity of land resources. Consequently, there is currently an urgent need to mitigate the conflict between the needs of growing urban areas and the shrinking supply of land resources. Understanding land-use intensity and its changes can provide important information to find mitigating measures for this conflict in the demand for land. Previous studies have found that increasing the utilization efficiency of land resources is one of the most effective ways to resolve this issue. This study focuses on the city of Guangzhou, which is an intensively developed megalopolis. A number of different data sources have been analyzed to find the characteristics and changes in urban land use in Guangzhou, including: Landsat data from 1979, 1990, 2000, and 2009; relative socioeconomic data from the Guangzhou statistic yearbooks; and the master plans of Guangzhou. The results indicate that the area of developed land has continued to increase. Urban development land intensity and its change were then explored using a Back Propagation neural network model of the city. Although the analysis revealed that urban development land did not have a higher intensity overall, it also showed that there was a sectional upward trend throughout the study period. Consequently, there is a potential to improve the land-use intensity of Guangzhou. A linear regression model was then adopted to explore the mechanism of land use change. The results reveal that rapid industrialization and urbanization have improved land-use intensity in Guangzhou. The per capita urban road area and per capita GDP show a strong relationship when compared with land-use intensity. Using the relative city master plans, the authors have argued that local government in Guangzhou has taken active steps to address land issues to promote the city's socioeconomic development; however, a scientific city master plan in the study area is still necessary to ensure the effective utilization of the city's limited land resources. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Taylor's interlocking specification of the world city network has offered researchers a theoretically informed way to measure the world city network using readily available firm location data. However, the number and size of firms that are viewed as linking cities to one another impose a form of structural determinism on the world city network. Specifically, when a relatively small number of firms is used to define a network among a relatively large set of cities, or when only larger firms are used, this approach is unable to reveal a wide range of structures features that may actually be present in the world city network it is intended to measure. Through a series of examples, I demonstrate how specific features of firm location data predetermine the structure, number and size of cliques, and density of world city networks derived using the interlocking approach. Concluding comments discuss the implications of this structural determinism by focusing on the case of the commonly used Globalization and World Cities data set 11, offer some suggestions concerning how the interlocking approach can be employed while avoiding structural determinism, and identify some alternative approaches to mapping the world city network.El modelo interconexión cerrada (interlocking) de la red mundial de ciudades (world city network) desarrollado por Taylor (2001) ha proporcionado a los investigadores un marco teórico para medir dicha red con datos fácilmente disponibles acerca de la localización de empresas. Sin embargo, el número y tamaño de las empresas que son consideradas como ‘vinculadoras’ (de ciudades) imponen una forma de determinismo estructural sobre la red. En concreto, cuando un número relativamente pequeño de firmas es utilizado para definir la red entre un conjunto relativamente grande de ciudades, o, cuando sólo se utilizan las empresas más grandes, este enfoque (interlocking) no es capaz de identificar o medir una amplia gama de características estructurales presentes potencialmente en la red de ciudades mundiales. A través de una serie de ejemplos, el autor demuestra cómo varias características específicas de los datos de localización de las empresas predeterminan la estructura, número y tamaño de los cliques y la densidad de las redes de ciudades mundiales resultantes de la aplicación de modelos de interlocking. Luego el autor presenta las implicancias del determinismo estructural mencionado, centrándose en el caso la base de datos de uso común GaWC # 11. Finalmente el articulo ofrece algunas sugerencias sobre cómo el enfoque de interlocking puede ser empleado sin caer en un determinismo estructural, y se identifican algunos enfoques alternativos para el mapeo de la red mundial de ciudades.泰勒（2001）采用相对容易获得的公司地理位置数据提出的世界城市网络连锁度量方法，为研究者提供了一种理论途径。然而，将公司的数量和规模视为城市之间的联接是一种强加的世界城市网络结构决定论形式。特别是当用数量相对较少的公司或仅用大公司的数量来定义相对较大的城市网络集时，该方法不能揭示目前实际情况中大范围世界城市网络需要度量的结构特征。通过一系列的案例分析，本文显示了公司区位数据的特有特征预先决定了集团的结构、数量和规模，以及由泰勒的连锁方法推导出世界城市网络的密度。最后，通过曾被广泛采用的GaWC（全球化和世界城市）数据集的11个城市公司数据讨论了结构决定方法的应用，并就应用该方法如何避免结构决定论提出一些建议，进而识别一些可选用的方法来绘制世界城市网络图。

AB  - A number of researchers have recently tried to map the contours of a transnational urban network. Although these empirical studies have great merits in making a closer connection to theoretical ideas on a genuine urban network, they sometimes fail to recognise that the whole idea of cities as ‘nodes’ in a transnational urban network is a heuristic at best. To assess this underdeveloped analytical connection, a taxonomy of dominant empirical and theoretical approaches is constructed. Contrasting both taxonomies reveals a mismatch between theory and measurement. This mismatch is addressed in more detail through four separate but entwined examples of conceptual conflation: a lack of rigour in the employed terminologies; inappropriate discussions of results against the background of other concepts; the inadequate delineation of the urban area; and, the limited analytical value of infrastructure-based analyses.

AB  - Land use planning concepts and methods have evolved new approaches due to the perception of the very long term impact of global change, particularly climate change. Future land use configurations provide valuable knowledge for policy makers and economic agents, especially under expected environmental changes such as decreasing rainfall or increasing temperatures. Considering the time frame requirements from climate change issues, usually 100 years, this paper proposes an optimization approach to study future land uses. Modelling land use change is designed as an optimization problem in which landscapes (land uses) are generated through the use of evolutionary algorithms (EA). GeneticLand is an evolutionary algorithm, designed for a multiobjective function, minimization of soil erosion, and maximization of carbon sequestration, and a set of local restrictions (e.g. physical constraints and landscape spatial structure). GeneticLand has been applied for a Mediterranean landscape, located in Southern Portugal. This paper presents the GeneticLand algorithm design and results obtained show the feasibility of the generated landscapes, whose main characteristic is an increase in spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - This study examines street art as a form of popular culture, popular communication, and popular spatial resistance that connects cities and the people in them. Taking a cultural studies approach, it asserts that street art serves not only as a medium for self- expression, but as a means for reclaiming public spaces, communicating to the masses, and forming local and global social networks. In the context of sociological globalization studies, the discourse of global cities, and global city network theory, it argues that street art can form inter-city networks of ‘multi-local’ popular resistance. Newly compiled quantitative data from six global street artists produce complete network matrices and visualizations representative of a weighted, directional network of eight cities. Empirical social network analysis is used in demonstrating this global urban network of street art, and discussing its properties and wider implications. This network analysis illustrates the existence of global urban networks based on subcultural practices, suggesting an important new way of looking at global city networks, and revealing the potential for other such studies. “Where

AB  - The network approach to urban studies can be differentiated from other approaches by its emphasis on the primacy of structures of interpersonal linkages, rather than on the classification of social units according to their individual characteristics. Network analysis is also a methodology for the investigation of these structures. Substantive issues related to interpersonal ties in the city, migration, resource allocation, neighborhood, and community are examined in terms of the network structures and processes that order and integrate urban activities. Finally, a view of the city itself as a network of networks is proposed. It is the organization of urban life by networks that makes the scale and diversity of the city a source of strength rather than of chaos, while it is precisely that scale and diversity which makes the existence of a complex and widely ramified network structure possible.

AB  - Centrality and power have become common foci for world city network research and frequently serve as tools for describing cities' position or status in the system. However, these concepts are difficult to define and measure. Often they are treated as equivalent: more central cities have more power. This paper challenges this assumed equivalence by proposing conceptually distinct definitions and developing two new measures that allow them to be differentiated empirically. Applying the proposed measures in a hypothetical world city network and the Internet backbone network reveals that centrality and power are distinct and suggests that world cities should be viewed as arising from multidimensional network positions that define multiple types: quintessential world cities that are both central and powerful (such as New York and London), hub world cities that are central but not powerful (such as Washington and Brussels) and gateway world cities that are powerful but not central (such as Miami and Stockholm).

AB  - The conclusion to this paper is quite straightforward: Milan remains Italy’s prime world city in terms of advanced producer services. Let us rehearse exactly what this means. Our analyses have measured a particularly important economic process in contemporary globalization: world city network formation. This is interpreted as an ongoing example of Jacobs’ dynamic city growth model and therefore it tells us why Milan has been identified as a current urban success story. Note that we have measured a process not a city. Cities are complex bundles of myriad processes; we have measured just one process, albeit a very important one, but obviously Milan, and also Rome, are so much more than economic growth machines. Of course, it is not at all surprising that Milan is currently more economically successful than Rome in the world city network. This city network pivots about financial services where Milan is particularly strong: contemporary financialization of the world economy gives Milan a major advantage. But there are many other city networks being formed within contemporary globalization, many where political processes are more salient (e.g. NGOs as city network-makers). Often within these networks Rome appears more important than Milan (Taylor 2005). However, today, it is economic networks to the fore reflecting the dominance of neo-liberal globalization over the last quarter of a century. Nevertheless, it is not inconceivable that as the twenty first century unfolds in an era of multiple crises (energy, climate, inequalities, identities, etc.), political processes might well return to outrank narrow economic priorities. A growing necessity for the some form of global governance could well turn the tables with Rome having new future advantages as aworld city in comparison to Milan’s less useful economic prowess.

AB  - Nowadays sustainability is among the most desired characteristics of the transport systems. Taking into account the soaring and the unpredictable rise of the transport needs in urban areas,in contrast with the suggestions for reducing individual travels,new solutions which should integrate the transport resources both of urban and suburban areas must be sought. The idea of organizing freight distribution chains through hub-and-spokes network can also be adapted for passengers transport. The infrastructure for individual transport,whenever motorised or non-motorised modes,in the proximity of large cities should also be developed to serve other high capacity transport networks,accomplishing all the traveller's needs within the sustainability framework. The technical,administrative or financial integration of peri-urban transport modes with urban public transport is a key element. The current paper highlights the particularities of such an approach and presents a case study for reorganizing the urban and peri-urban connections in Bucharest city.

AB  - All networks, including biological networks (e.g., metabolic networks, transcription regulatory networks, protein-protein interaction networks, protein structure networks, neural networks, ecological networks), social networks, technological networks (e.g., computer networks, electrical circuits), etc., can be represented as graphs, which include a wide variety of subgraphs. One important local property of networks is Network Motifs, recurrent and statistically significant sub-graphs or patterns. Motifs, sub-graphs that repeat themselves in a specific network or even among various networks, would be consistent with the tenets of evolutionary theory. Each of these sub-graphs, defined by a particular pattern of interactions between vertices, may reflect a framework in which particular functions are achieved efficiently. Indeed, motifs are of notable importance largely because they may reflect functional properties. They have recently gathered much attention as a useful concept to uncover structural design principles of complex networks.[1] Although network motifs may provide a deep insight into the network’s functional abilities, their detection is computationally challenging.

Groups participating in stewardship activities range in age, size, and geography and represent an increasingly complex and dynamic arrangement of civil society, government and business sectors. To better understand the structure, function and network of these community-based urban land managers, an assessment was conducted in 2004 by the research subcommittee of the Urban Ecology Collaborative. The goal of the assessment was to better understand the role of stewardship organizations engaged in urban ecology initiatives in selected major cities in the Northeastern U.S.: Boston, New Haven, New York City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. A total of 135 active organizations participated in this assessment. Findings include the discovery of a dynamic social network operating within cities, and a reserve of social capital and expertise that could be better utilized. Although often not the primary land owner, stewardship groups take an increasingly significant responsibility for a wide range of land use types including street and riparian corridors, vacant lots, public parks and gardens, green roofs, etc. Responsibilities include the delivery of public programs as well as daily maintenance and fundraising support. While most of the environmental stewardship organizations operate on staffs of zero or fewer than ten, with small cohorts of community volunteers, there is a significant difference in the total amount of program funding. Nearly all respondents agree that committed resources are scarce and insufficient with stewards relying upon and potentially competing for individual donations, local foundations, and municipal support. This makes it a challenge for the groups to grow beyond their current capacity and to develop long-term programs critical to resource management and education. It also fragments groups, making it difficult for planners and property owners to work in partnership with them. The organizational networks are self-contained and do not include business or even legal groups, which may point to a gap between stewardship and environmental justice organizations.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe the construction of a set of data that can be used to measure intercity relations. Building on a speci? cation of the world city network as an ‘interlocking network’ in which business service ? rms play the crucial role in network formation, information is gathered from global service ? rms about the size of their presence in a city and about any ‘extra-territorial’ functions of their of? ces. This information is converted into data to provide the ‘service value’ of a city for a ? rm’s provision of its service in a 316 (cities) 3 100 (? rms) matrix. These data are used to measure the global network connectivity of the cities. In an initial analysis, the paper concludes with a simple correlation exercise that shows New York and London to be ‘exceptions’ rather than ‘exemplars’ amongst contemporary world cities.

AB  - In contrast to the classical view of development as a preprogrammed and deterministic process, recent studies have demonstrated that stochastic perturbations of highly non-linear systems may underlie the emergence and stability of biological patterns. Herein, we address the question of whether noise contributes to the generation of the stereotypical temporal pattern in gene expression during flower development. We modeled the regulatory network of organ identity genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana flower as a stochastic system. This network has previously been shown to converge to ten fixed-point attractors, each with gene expression arrays that characterize inflorescence cells and primordial cells of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. The network used is binary, and the logical rules that govern its dynamics are grounded in experimental evidence. We introduced different levels of uncertainty in the updating rules of the network. Interestingly, for a level of noise of around 0.5-10%, the system exhibited a sequence of transitions among attractors that mimics the sequence of gene activation configurations observed in real flowers. We also implemented the gene regulatory network as a continuous system using the Glass model of differential equations, that can be considered as a first approximation of kinetic-reaction equations, but which are not necessarily equivalent to the Boolean model. Interestingly, the Glass dynamics recover a temporal sequence of attractors, that is qualitatively similar, although not identical, to that obtained using the Boolean model. Thus, time ordering in the emergence of cell-fate patterns is not an artifact of synchronous updating in the Boolean model. Therefore, our model provides a novel explanation for the emergence and robustness of the ubiquitous temporal pattern of floral organ specification. It also constitutes a new approach to understanding morphogenesis, providing predictions on the population dynamics of cells with different genetic configurations during development.

AB  - The incidence of change to existing houses and gardens within England's interwar residential areas is examined, the focus being on sample areas originally developed by private enterprise in Birmingham and London. Larger-scale changes, mostly subject to development control by the local authority, notably the building of additional houses within existing gardens, subdivisions and amalgamations of houses, changes of use, extensions and other significant structural works, are distinguished from changes initiated by households without planning permission, and often without building permission, such as changes to chimneys, reroofing, and changes to doors, windows, porches, and gardens. Changes subject to development control are negatively correlated, and smaller-scale changes are positively correlated, with the dwelling density at which the sample areas were originally developed. Among the factors responsible for this are the greater susceptibility of the areas of higher dwelling density to the contagious diffusion of minor and cosmetic changes.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

AB  - In a recent article, Zachary Neal (2011) distinguishes between centrality and power in world city networks and proposes two measures of recursive power and centrality. His effort to clarify oversimplistic interpretations of relational measures of power and position in world city networks is appreciated. However, Neal’s effort to innovate methodologically is based on theoretical reasoning that is dubious when applied to world city networks. And his attempt to develop new measures is flawed since he conflates ‘eigenvector centrality’ with ‘beta centrality’ and then argues that ‘eigenvector-based approaches’ to recursive power and centrality are ill-suited to world city networks. The main problem is that his measures of ‘recursive’ centrality and power are not recursive at all and thus are of very limited utility. It is concluded that established eigenvector centrality measures used in past research (which Neal critiques) provide more useful gauges of power and centrality in world city networks than his new indexes.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - This chapter offers a commentary on the correspondence exchanged between René Thom and Conrad Hal Waddington in 1967, concerning the interpretation in terms of catastrophe theory of the concepts of epigenetic landscape and chreod, introduced by Conrad Hal Waddington since the 1940s. It is intended to provide some elements of reflection on the difficulties encountered in exchanges between a mathematician and a biologist on the subject of the mathematization – in this case by means of a “dynamical systems” approach – of a theoretical question in biology, expressed in images by the compound metaphor of epigenetic landscape. One interpretation of the disagreement between the two scholars is based on the difference between their mathematical cultures, making it difficult to establish a shared dictionary (this was René Thom’s view). But another aspect must be taken into account to understand the difficulties of dialogue between the two scientists: the choice of variables (and the timescale specific to each of them) used to construct a mathematical model of the epigenetic landscape.

AB  - This research is concerned with the automatic generalisation of road networks from a single detailed database. The challenge of representing networks at changing scales is that we retain the essence of connectivity and continuity throughout the network, whilst reducing the level of detail. The algorithm builds on prior work concerning the perceptual organisation of map objects, and has as its focus the urban network (rather than the rural) where particular challenges exist. When simplifying the city network, it is important to retain its links with the surrounding rural region. The algorithm focuses on identifying and retaining those parts of the network that best define and demarcate the various regions that typically comprise the city. It does this through the use of both graph theoretic constructs, and analysis of the areal partitions created by the existence of a network. The implementation, within an object oriented GIS is outlined, and the effectiveness of the technique illustrated and evaluated.

Study of developmental biology in the molecular era began by concentrating on simpler aspects such as gene control and signalling, and treated morphogenesis as a ‘black box’. Now, molecular analysis is being extended to the creation of form. This book presents examples of how morphogenesis happens and is organized by topic, beginning at the level of supramolecular complexes, then the level of individual cells and moving on to the level of tissues. The approach stresses the underlying abstract principles behind different examples and the relationships between different elements in the morphogenetic toolkit.

Subsections of the declaration deal with an urban world, a global city, migrant cities, unsustainable urban-natural relations, neoliberalization, attacks on democracy, community vulnerability, the rise of racism, and some thoughts on possible alternatives. The strategic purpose of this declaration was to be an intervention at meetings of the international urban community, for example for the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in January 2003 and similar regional and local events.

AB  - This paper describes a mobile prototype and a protocol to measure light pollution based on astronomical methods. The prototype takes three all-sky images using BVR filters of the Johnson-Cousins astronomical photometric system. The stars are then identified in the images of the Hipparcos and General Catalogue of Photometric Data II astronomical catalogues, and are used as calibration sources. This method permits the measurement of night-sky brightness and facilitates an estimate of which fraction is due to the light up-scattered in the atmosphere by a wide variety of man-made sources. This is achieved by our software, which compares the sky background flux to that of many stars of known brightness. The reduced weight and dimensions of the prototype allow the user to make measurements from virtually any location. This prototype is capable of measuring the sky distribution of light pollution, and also provides an accurate estimate of the background flux at each photometric band.

AB  - The role of proteinases in extracellular matrix remodeling during the developmental program of bone, cartilage, muscle, and epithelial differentiation in the mandibular arch during embryogenesis was investigated. ECM changes accompany morphogenesis during development. The most dramatic changes occur during development of bone and cartilage. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was altered by regulating expression of MMPs by growth factors, by inhibiting MMP activity, and by genetic ablation of MMPs. The data point to critical roles for MMPs in cartilage development and endochondral bone formation. MMPs appear to regulate not only ECM degradation but also programmed cell death, cell migration, and invasion during these morphogenic processes. The data suggest that matrix metalloproteinases play it pivotal role in the morphogenesis of structures derived from epithelium (oral sulcus), semitic mesoderm (tongue), and cranial neural crest (Meckel's cartilage).

AB  - Foreword : Railway stations are at the heart of the nation’s psyche. They feature in blockbuster films, romantic novels and the skylines of many towns and cities. However, they are far more important to the nation than as mere artistic reference points. Millions of people use the nation’s railway stations every day. Towns and cities have often developed around them, placing railway stations in the heart of many communities. The station can often help to provide an identity or symbol for the town or city; it can act as a point of reference as well as a civic amenity for people who want to use the station’s facilities, whether they are travelling or not. Done well, their design and operation helps to facilitate the success of the national rail network. A successful railway station will add to the passenger experience as well as support the economic, social and environmental benefits of rail. Their effective integration with other modes of transport and the surrounding area can provide for an end-to-end journey experience that makes sustainable public transport a real alternative to private vehicle usage. Given these varying demands on stations it is vitally important that they are planned, designed and improved in a manner that recognises all that they have to offer. I hope that this Guide will aid promoters, planners, architects and sponsors of station schemes to develop railway stations that maintain and enhance the legacy and contribution of stations going forward. Finally, I would like to thank the individuals and organisations who helped to shape and review this document including: Department for Transport, CABE, Transport for London, Stagecoach South West Trains, First Group, Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, Passenger Focus, London TravelWatch, English Heritage, PTEG

AB  - We present a network model and its dynamic analysis for the regulatory relationships among 11 genes that participate in Arabidopsis thaliana flower morphogenesis. The topology of the network and the relative strengths of interactions among these genes were based from published genetic and molecular data, mainly relying on mRNA expression patterns under wild type and mutant backgrounds. The network model is made of binary elements and we used a particular dynamic implementation for the network that we call semi-synchronic. Using this method the network reaches six attractors; four of them correspond to observed patterns of gene expression found in the floral organs of Arabidopsis (sepals, petals, stamens and carpels) as predicted by the ABC model of flower morphogenesis. The fifth state corresponds to cells that are not competent to flowering, and the sixth attractor predicted by the model is never found in wild-type plants, but it could be induced experimentally. We discuss the biological implications and the potential use of this network modeling approach to integrate functional data of regulatory genes of plant development.

AB  - As the world shrinks into a ‘global village’, cities have come into focus as dominant nodes in the global transactions and flows of capital, commodities, people and services. The resulting economic cum information order is not only transforming the architecture of discrete cities everywhere but is alsomotivating newpatterns of inter-city relations and networks. Global urban network is now synonymous with the trans-state processes that make up the global economy (Taylor, Political Geography 19:5–32, 2000). Hence, cities are increasing perceived as a new ‘resource’ and ‘spring board’ for connecting to and operating at the global level. The article explores these issues with reference to the place and function of African cities in the global urban network.A city- based assessment of this nature offers a fresh and fluid scope to African development question and quest as against the more conventional ‘state-centric’ benchmarking.

AB  - The present study examined the influence of bilateral peripheral vestibular loss (BVL) in humans on postural responses to multidirectional surface rotations in the pitch and roll planes. Specifically, we examined the effects of vestibular loss on the directional sensitivity, timing, and amplitude of early stretch, balance correcting, and stabilizing reactions in postural leg and trunk muscles as well as changes in ankle torque and trunk angular velocity following multidirectional rotational perturbations of the support surface. Fourteen normal healthy adults and five BVL patients stood on a dual axis rotating platform which rotated 7.5 degrees at 50 degrees/s through eight different directions of pitch and roll combinations separated by 45 degrees. Directions were randomized within a series of 44 perturbation trials which were presented first with eyes open, followed by a second series of trials with eyes closed. Vestibular loss did not influence the range of activation or direction of maximum sensitivity for balance correcting responses (120-220 ms). Response onsets at approximately 120 ms were normal in tibialis anterior (TA), soleus (SOL), paraspinals (PARAS), or quadriceps muscles. Only SOL muscle activity demonstrated a 38- to 45-ms delay for combinations of forward (toe-down) and roll perturbations in BVL patients. The amplitude of balance correcting responses in leg muscles between 120 and 220 ms was, with one exception, severely reduced in BVL patients for eyes open and eyes closed conditions. SOL responses were decreased bilaterally for toe-up and toe-down perturbations, but more significantly reduced in the downhill (load-bearing) leg for combined roll and pitch perturbations. TA was significantly reduced bilaterally for toe-up perturbations, and in the downhill leg for backward roll perturbations. Forward perturbations, however, elicited significantly larger TA activity in BVL between 120 and 220 ms compared to normals, which would act to further destabilize the body. As a result of these changes in response amplitudes, BVL patients had reduced balance correcting ankle torque between 160 and 260 ms and increased torque between 280 and 380 ms compared to normals. There were no differences in the orientation of the resultant ankle torque vectors between BVL and normals, both of which were oriented primarily along the pitch plane. For combinations of backward (toe-up) and roll perturbations BVL patients had larger balance correcting and stabilizing reactions (between 350 and 700 ms) in PARAS than normals and these corresponded to excessive trunk pitch and roll velocities. During roll perturbations, trunk velocities in BVL subjects after 200 ms were directed along directions different from those of normals. Furthermore, roll instabilities appeared later than those of pitch particularly for backward roll perturbations. The results of the study show that combinations of roll and pitch surface rotations yield important spatiotemporal information, especially with respect to trunk response strategies changed by BVL which are not revealed by pitch plane perturbations alone. Our results indicate that vestibular influences are earlier for the pitch plane and are directed to leg muscles, whereas roll control is later and focused on trunk muscles.

AB  - World cities are generally deemed to form an urban system or city network but these are never explicitly specified in the literature. In this paper the world city network is identified as an unusual form of network with three levels of structure: cities as the nodes, the world economy as the supranodal network level, and advanced producer service firms forming a critical subnodal level. The latter create an interlocking network through their global location strategies for placing offices. Hence, it is tile advanced producer service firms operating through cities who are the prime actors in world city network formation. This process is formally specified in terms of four inter city relational matrices-elemental. proportional, distance, and asymmetric. Through this specification it becomes possible to apply standard techniques of network analysis to world cities for the first time. In a short conclusion the relevance of this world city network specification for both theory and policy-practice is briefly discussed.

AB  - The mobility challenges of the developing world are considerably different than those in wealthier, advanced countries, and so are the challenges of coordinating transportation and land use. Rapid population growth, poverty and income disparities, overcrowded urban cores, poorly designed road networks, spatial mismatches between housing and jobs, deteriorating environmental conditions, and economic losses from extreme traffic by congestion are among the more vexing challenges faced by developing cities that could be assuaged through improved coordination of transportation and urban development. This is underscored by examples reviewed in this paper from South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, India, Africa, and South America. It is concluded that whatever is done to improve transportation and land-use integration must be pro-poor. The cardinal features of integrated and sustainable transport and urbanism everywhere---accessible urban activities and safe, attractive walking and cycling environs---are particularly vital to the welfare and prosperity of urbanites in the world's poorest countries.

AB  - In eukaryotes, cell morphogenesis is regulated coordinately with the cell cycle. In fission yeast, the morphogenesis network MOR (morphogenesis Orb6 network) consists of 5 conserved proteins, Pmo25, Nak1, Mor2, Orb6, and Mob2, and is essential for cell polarity control and cell separation following cytokinesis. Here we show that the conserved leucine-rich repeat protein Lrp1 is required for cell morphogenesis as a newly recognized component of MOR. Lrp1 has 4 leucine-rich repeats in its N-terminus and is a homolog of the budding yeast Sog2, which is a component of the RAM network (regulation of Ace2 activity and cellular morphogenesis). Lrp1 was essential for both cell growth and cell morphogenesis as were the other MOR components. Lrp1 was localized to the SPBs (spindle pole bodies, the yeast equivalent of the animal centrosome) throughout the cell cycle and to the medial ring during cytokinesis. Lrp1 interacted with Nak1 and was important for Orb6 kinase activity. Thus Lrp1 proved to function upstream of Orb6 in cell morphogenesis.

However, the latter remains an elusive goal as the land use rights and interests of Canada’s Aboriginal peoples have yet to be reconciled with those of other Canadians. To date, the solutions have been inequitable, forcing Aboriginal peoples to either accept the policies and institutions imposed upon them by the Canadian State, or refuse to participate at all. Planning Co-Existence - the second of two volumes highlighting the critical research of the Aboriginal Program of the Sustainable Forest Management Network - presents the question: How do we begin to accommodate the land and resource use rights and interests of Canada’s Aboriginal peoples while fi nding common ground for co-existence with other Canadians who have come to occupy these shared spaces? By addressing this question, Planning Co-Existence explores the current state of land use planning in Canada, what may be required to meet the Crown’s legal and fi duciary obligations in these processes, and a variety of issues of central importance to Aboriginal peoples that need to be addressed in the design and implementation of forestry and land use plans.

The community grows as a new member is introduced by an existing member at each time step. The new member then creates a new group or joins one of the groups of the introducer. We investigate the emerging community structure analytically and numerically. The group size distribution shows a power law distribution for a variety of growth rules, while the activity distribution follows an exponential or a power law depending on the details of the growth rule. We also present an analysis of empirical data from on the online communities, the ``Groups'' in \url{http://www.yahoo.com} and the ``Cafe'' in \url{http://www.daum.net}, which shows a power law distribution for a wide range of group sizes.

AB  - The exquisitely beautiful form of a developing embryo is the result of a coordination between the driving forces of morphogenesis and the processes of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and death. Morphogenesis is responsible for bringing cell populations together for new inductive interactions and for building complex, three-dimensional structures such as hearts, limbs, lungs, and eyes out of simple epithelial sheets and mes- enchymal cell masses. Research over the past two de- cades has elucidated many of the genetic pathways underlying cell division, cell fate determination, and dif- ferentiation, and has shown them to be evolutionarily conserved. A major challenge now is to explore the possibility that there is also a conserved “morphoge- netic code”—a set of rules common to processes that are used repeatedly in different combinations to make functional organs. These instructions fall into two cate- gories. First, there are basic subroutines that define es- sentially mechanical operations such as the packaging of cells into segments, the folding of epithelial sheets into tubes or cups, and the outgrowth of buds. Each of these modules utilizes sets of genes controlling proper-ties such as differential cell adhesion, cell motility, cell- matrix interactions, and cytoskeletal organization. The second category determines how these subrou- tines are coordinated with cell proliferation and cell fate determination. This “project management” depends on signaling centers that arise in the organ primordia or progenitor fields at positions initially determined by the primary embryonic axes. Each center is a group of cells that regulates the behavior of surrounding cells by pro- ducing positive and negative intercellular signaling mol- ecules. Evidence is beginning to accumulate that the majority of these signaling factors are proteins encoded by a relatively small number of conserved multigene families, in particular the Fgfs,Bmps, Hedgehogs, Wnts, and Egfs. The diverse biological activities of individual ligands are regulated byantagonists, activators, or post- translational modifiers that control, for example, the range over which the protein can function or its half- life in the environment. In addition, the signaling genes themselves are often transcriptionally regulated by posi- tive and/or negative feedback loops. An exciting pros- pect for the future is the possibility of being able to compute how each of these variables, in combination with the downstream subroutines they control, ulti- mately affects the size, shape, and pattern of a particular organ.

AB  - Peter Taylor's compelling insights challenge us to view cities as part of a global network, divorced from the constraints of national or even regional boundaries.\n\nWith the advent of multinational corporations, the traditional urban service function has 'gone global'. In order to provide services to globalizing corporate clients, the offices of major financial and business service firms across the world have formed a network. It is the myriad of flows between office towers in different metropolitan centres that has produced a world city network.\n\nThrough an analysis of the intra-company flows of 100 leading global service firms across 315 cities, this book assesses cities in terms of their overall network connectivity, their connectivity by service sector, and their connectivity by world region.\n\nPeter Taylor's unique and illuminating book provides the first comprehensive and systematic description and analysis of the world city network as the 'skeleton' upon which contemporary globalization has been built. His analyses challenge the traditional view of the world as a 'mosaic map' of political boundaries.\n\nWritten by one of the foremost authorities on the subject, this book provides a much needed mapping of the connecting relationships between world cities, and will be an enlightening book for students of urban studies, geography, sociology and planning.

AB  - Urban form, in terms of extent of geographic decentralization, varies among nations around the world with those in Asia the most dense, European cities of intermediate density and US and Australian cities as most decentralized (Newman and Kenworthy, 1999). The advantages of high density or compact cities for environmental sustainability have been increasingly discussed in the academic literature (Beatley, 2000; Ewing, 1997; Gordon and Richardson, 1989; Newman and Kenworthy, 1989; Newman and Kenworthy, 1999; Pope, 1999). The positive returns include more efficient use of motor vehicles and therefore a reduction in fossil fuel combustion, reduced sprawl, less congestion (when planned correctly), and more efficient infrastructure allocation, among others. Key to the implementation of the model is urban transport and land use patterns. Authors suggest that achieving sustainable cities is primarily a task of overcoming automobile dependence (Newman and Kenworthy, 1999), as transport is intimately related to land use and will affect the citys future development (Clark, 1999; Hall and Pfeiffer, 2000). There is a broad consensus of academic and political views that favor some form of compact city as one answer to the demand for more sustainable lifestyles.

AB  - The problem of traffic congestion is attracting lots of attention with the aim of investigating efficient solutions. To achieve models that comprehensively describe the system, useful data from the network is needed. A suggestion is to mount detectors in selected regions and study the system responses to various stimuli. This, however, might be costly and impractical in many cases. Traffic simulators are beneficial tools for providing a simulated environment of the network. The current study tries to develop a traffic simulator within NetLogo, an agent-based environment. Using this simulator, the effect of different light plans on average delay time (ADT) of vehicles is investigated. The results indicate that in a normal-sized network a better choice is the simultaneous change of lights. A long length is appropriate for low entering frequencies and an average length is more efficient for high entering frequencies. In geometrically bigger networks, lights are better to change every other one with an average length for low entering frequencies and a long length for high entering frequencies.

AB  - Polycentric urban regions, or urban networks, are often associated with the notion of synergy, the assumption being that the individual cities in these collections of distinct but proximally located cities relate to each other in a synergetic way, making the whole network of cities more than the sum of its parts. Drawing on economic network theories, an analysis of the presence of synergy is carried out for the Randstad region in the Netherlands, which is often considered a classic example of a polycentric urban region. The analysis focuses on the synergy mechanisms of co-operation and in particular complementarity. The results are mixed. In terms of co-operation, the Randstad has become more synergetic. However, the less complementary economic roles of the cities caused a reverse effect.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - To satisfy the requirement of secure isolation of Infrastructure–as-a-Service (IaaS) for enterprise customers, virtual private clouds, which are separated from others by using virtualization technologies, are deployed. However, isolation with virtualization technologies cannot avoid the affect of performance degradation, such as traffic congestion. Therefore, bandwidth- guaranteed virtual private clouds are needed for excluding unintentional and unwanted influence among multiple customers. In this paper, we propose a sustainable network resource management system (NRM) introducing a CHAnging MEchanism of software moduLE based on the cONtext (CHAMELEON) and a virtual network point for multipoint network provisioning. With the proposed mechanisms, we successfully demonstrated the sustainability of the NRM, which controls six kinds of network equipment without any modification itself.

AB  - A clear and accurate understanding of communication network performance is essential, especially where all layers of the protocol stack - from physical propagation to application transport protocols - must be accounted for. While some solutions exist for RF communications over `open-terrain' areas, the urban environment is particularly challenging. To meet this challenge, a server-based, real-time solution for assessing complex communication and network effects in urban environments has been developed. By combining advanced RF ray-tracing propagation modeling and a full network simulator, the Scalable Urban Network Simulation (SUNS) software is able to provide accurate communications effects services. SUNS supports tactical modeling and simulation by predicting electro-magnetic signal coverage and path loss through application of a full 3D physical knowledge of the urban environment and terrain features. The commercial OPNET network simulator is used as the core of the system, with SUNS operations supported through a custom OPNET model that functions as a modeling and simulation server. The server, in turn, communicates with other node models within the OPNET simulation. In the approach, urban propagation data are pre-computed using high-performance computing (HPC) resources utilizing ray traced models of the urban scene.

AB  - Since the mid-1970s, Vietnam experienced a period of transition to socialism, before bringing in economic reforms which led to the gradual dismantling of the subsidised system of planning and the opening up of the country to the global capitalist economy. Economic reform and renovation has important implications for the urban areas of Vietnam. The emergence of markets and the abandonment of many restrictions on travel resulted in a freeing up of the urbanisation process during the 1980s and early 1990s. These processes are considered, and the implications for Vietnam's largest urban area, Ho Chi Minh City, are examined. The likely impact of Vietnam's long-term socioeconomic strategy on the urban network in the remainder of the decade is considered.

AB  - What's different about social network data? On one hand, there really isn't anything about social network data that is all that unusual. Networkers do use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets of observations that they use. But, network data can also be described and understood using the ideas and concepts of more familiar methods, like cross-sectional survey research. On the other hand, the data sets that networkers develop usually end up looking quite different from the conventional rectangular data array so familiar to survey researchers and statistical analysts. The differences are quite important because they lead us to look at our data in a different way - and even lead us to think differently about how to apply statistics.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

The paper describes strategies which seek to implement this new regional planning guideline. The formation of an urban forum as a co-ordinating body has initiated a course of development which attempts to link aspects of both horizontal and vertical policy co-ordination within a framework of territorial integration (networking). The paper analyses this innovative instrument of urban and regional development. The authors focus on the process of co-operation, beginning with the looser form practised in the urban forum by the towns which participated and evolving towards defined contractual and institutional relations in the form of a networked urban workgroup.

AB  - The role of robust communications plays an ever pervasive and critical role in today's network-oriented asymmetric warfare. This is especially true in urban environments, where insurgencies tend to be most active and detrimental to the civilian population. Urban-level communications needs to be addressed through a new generation of modeling and simulation tools that not only model the physical layers of radio communications, but that also account for reactive network behaviors that drive higher-level force actions (e.g., the interplay of ground troops, ground vehicles, airborne UAVs, manned aircraft, etc.) Such tools should become essential to communications mission planning, while advancing the deployment of optimally designed communications systems for use in highly complex RF environments. To this end, we describe the Scalable Urban Network Simulation (SUNS), which coordinates physical layer EM propagation modeling with network-level and higher "forces level" modeling to achieve a highly interactive, "full communications stack" approach to network simulation.

AB  - The challenge of facilitating economic density is fundamental for successful urbanization. Flexible and forward-looking institutions that help the efficient functioning of land markets are vital in this respect. In particular, institutional arrangements for regulating land use, managing public land and allocating land rights have significant implications for how cities deliver agglomeration economies and improve the welfare of their residents. This book provides fresh insights into these issues, compiling selected pieces of analytical and empirical research presented at the World Bank's Fourth Urban Research Symposium on Urban Land Use and Land Markets, held in Washington, DC, May 2007. Specially commissioned papers helped develop a robust analytical foundation to clarify ongoing debates on urban land management and welfare and synthesized the political and administrative challenges of improving the efficiency of urban land markets. Among the questions that this book addresses are: - Does more public intervention in land markets produce more affordable land market outcomes? - Do conventional approaches to strengthening property rights bolster security of tenure and market transactions? - How should governments go about integrating informal settlements with the broader city economy? © World Bank 2009.

AB  - Conceptually, the degrees of spatial and functional integration and urban complementarities in economic network relations are hypothesised to be important. In this paper, data on interfirm relations in the Dutch Randstad are used to test conditions for integration and the existence of economic complementarities. A clear hierarchy is observed in the different types of spatial interdependencies in the Randstad, in which the central place model prevails. Furthermore, no evidence is found for the functional integration of municipalities in the Randstad. It is concluded that, at this moment, the Randstad does not function as a spatially and functionally integrated region and that spatial economic policy can better focus on smaller regions within the Randstad. This also calls into question the applicability of the urban network concept in general, as the Dutch Randstad is usually seen as a prime example of an economically successful polycentric urban system.

AB  - GM production is up, but that doesn't mean Latin Americans like or want it, say Luisa Massarani, Ildeu de Castro Moreira and  Ana Maria Vara*.\n\nA report launched by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) in March 2010 paints a rosy picture of small-scale farmers embracing — and benefitting from — genetic modification (GM) technology at a rapid pace (see GM crops flourishing in developing world, says report).\n\nBut recent research from China shows that wide planting of GM cotton has caused a surge in pests (see Bt cotton linked with surge in crop pest).\n\nOur experience in Brazil and Argentina — both among the world's top producers of GM crops — similarly indicates that growth in GM crop production has guaranteed neither wide-scale social acceptance of the technology nor benefits for small-scale farmers.\n\nEarly acclaim\n\nIt is true that when, in the late 1990s, international agribusiness Monsanto introduced Argentina to Roundup Ready soya (a crop designed to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate), politicians and many commercialfarmers welcomed it with open arms.\n\nVery early on, multinational corporations and farmers' associations began an intense promotional campaign for GM crops, trading on the country's view of itself as a leading grain producer.\n\nJust one government office was responsible for GM crops, and this helped ensure the legal system didn't pose any obstacles. In fact, the issue of GM food was never really put up for public debate.\n\nAnd Monsanto's GM soya arrived in Argentina when the country was entering a major economic crisis, and agricultural income was badly needed.\n\nThere were other favourable economic factors too. Monsanto didn't have a monopoly over the technology because it could not patent its Roundup Ready soya in Argentina. Also, glyphosate was no longer under patent; field machinery was easily accessible under contract; and to GM needed less field labour compared with non-GM soya.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, GM soya was highly profitable, especially when combined with non-till practices and an increase in agro-chemical use. All these factors contributed GM soya's rapid penetration into Argentinean agriculture.\n\nBut our interviews and focus groups with about 50 Argentinean small-scale farmers in 2007revealed concern about the social changes the switch to GM soya causes. GM profits for many came not from growing the crop themselves, but from renting their land to commercial farmers for large-scale production.\n\nThis threatens sustainability because it increases small-scale farmers' reliance on external parties for their income, and can also mean both agricultural skills and land fertility are lost.\n\nBattle for Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the opposition to GM crops has been much more overt, with Monsanto's move to introduce Roundup Ready soya sparking almost a decade of controversies and legal disputes.\n\nAs early as 1998the Worker's Party — the main opposition party at the time— adopted an anti-GM stance. Some state governments too, for example in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná, ideologically opposed GM crops and even implemented local legislation to prohibit them.\n\nEnvironmental groupsand social movements, such as Greenpeace and the Movement of the Landless Rural Workers, also took up anti-GM positions and were much more vocal and active in campaigning against GM crops than their Argentinean counterparts.\n\nAnd if political divisions have characterised the GM debate in Brazil, so too have divisions within the scientific community.\n\nThe community generally supported research into GM crops. The Brazilian Academy of Science also supported growing them. But several prominent scientists, including Glaci Zancan, then president of the Brazilian Association for the Advancement of Science, opposed commercial GM crops in the absence of long-term studies on health and environmental impacts.  \n\nOvercoming opposition\n\nDespite the controversy and criticism, GM crop cultivation has expanded rapidly in Brazil, even before it was legally approved in 2005. Our focus groups and individual interviews with about 80 Brazilian stakeholders and approximately 200 small-scale farmers reveal many reasons for this growth.\n\nThey include the use of non-approved GM seeds illegally brought over from Argentina; a curiosity for testing new seeds; pressures to keep the harvest as economically productive as possible; and the fact that, in some regions, conventional soya seeds are becoming hard to find.\n\nBut more important than these factors has been the clever tactics employed by the pro-GM lobby, which even include — according to some of our interviewees — doling out free GM seeds.\n\nThe most significant move was the tactic that got GM soya legalised in 2005. The pro-GM lobby got the issue of stem cell research onto the same bill as GM soya — the biosafety law. This move capitalised on the much broader support among politicians, scientists and the public for stem cell research.\n\nThe strategy worked — the bill was passed by parliament by 352 votes to 60, and officially enabled the production and sale of GM soya in Brazil.\n\nBut the debate is far from over. There are still strong tensions around GM within government, and small-scale farmers remain unconvinced. Our research found a strong demand for unbiased information on GM crops and three national surveys also found a lack of acceptance of GM crops, even among farmers growing GM soya. Indeed, a common refrain among those we interviewed was "I'm happy to grow it, but I wouldn't eat it".\n\nIn Latin America, as in many developing regions of the world, the GM debate is 'messy'. There is a danger in interpreting a simple increase in GM crop cultivation as a sign that countries are wholeheartedly in favour of the technology, or that acceptance and benefits are widespread.\n\nLuisa Massarani is Latin America and Caribbean coordinator for SciDev.Net and researcher at Museum of Life, House of Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz, Brazil.\n\nIldeu de Castro Moreira is a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAna Maria Vara is a researcher at the National University of San Martín, Argentina.\n\n*The authors thank Carla Almeida and Fabio Gouveia for their contributions to both this article and the research project it mentions, which was supported by the International Development Research Centre

AB  - The business connections between Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai and other major world cities are investigated using the interlocking network model based upon the location strategies of advanced producer service firms. This approach emphasises non-hierarchical relations between cities. A key new finding is that city-dyad analysis enhances the prominence of these China cities compared with simple ranking by total global network connectivity. This suggests that Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing have developed more strategically important roles in the world city network than previously understood. Yet the geographies of these links are distinctive, with Shanghai shown to be better connected to the more important world cities such as London and New York than Beijing; and Beijing is found to be better connected to political world cities such as Washington and Brussels, and to other Pacific Asian cities, than Shanghai. The results are interpreted as suggestions for developing a new research programme.

AB  - This thesis is submitted as partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of doctor philosophiae and is a result of four years of research at the Department of Physics, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The work presented represents applications of concepts from statistical physics and modern network theory. The systems studied vary and include fractured geological media, crumpled paper, political polling results and pure network theory. In the introductory chapters I familiarise the reader with the main concepts that are applied in the papers at the end. A total of five papers are included. Paper I 1 : The network formed by ridges in a straightened sheet of crumpled paper is studied using a laser profilometer. Square sheets of paper were crumpled into balls, unfolded and their height profiles measured. From these profiles the ridges formed during the crumpling were extracted and viewed as networks. Nodes were defined as intersections between ridges, and links as the various ridges connecting the nodes. Several network and spatial properties have been investigated such as the ridge length distribution, the degree distribution and the facet area distribution. The tail of the ridge length distribution was found to follow a power-law whereas the shorter ridges followed a log-normal distribution. The degree distribution was found to have an exponentially decaying tail, and the degree correlation was found to be disassortative. The facets created by the ridges and the Voronoi diagram formed by the nodes have also been investigated. Paper II 2 : In this paper we present a generalised version of the classical cluster coefficient, which can also be applied to networks with directed links. This generalisation takes into account more than the immediate nearest neighbours, giving more detailed information about the network structure than the classical version. The introduced concept is compared to earlier generalisation attempts, and it is applied to the directed protein interaction network of the S. cerevisiae yeast cell. Paper III 3 : This paper describes the application of statistical methods to political polling data in order to look for correlations and memory effects. We i ii propose measures for quantifying the political memory using the correlation function and scaling analysis. These methods reveal time correlations and self-affine scaling properties. We have applied these measures to polling data from Norway. Power-law dependencies have been found between correlation measures and party size, and different scaling behaviour has been found for large and small parties. Paper IV 4 : Fracture data from eight granite outcrops from the Laxemar and Simpevarp areas in south-east Sweden have been investigated as complex networks. For each outcrop a network was generated by viewing each fracture as a node, and linking it to any other fractures that it intersects. We show that the networks have complex behaviour with a broad degree distribution. The clustering coefficients and efficiencies are compared with values for rewired and random versions of the networks, and on this basis we have classified the networks as small-world networks. The degree-degree correlations of the networks indicates that they are disassortative. Paper V 5 : In this paper we present a modern complex network (Graph theory) analysis of a discrete fracture network (DFN) model in two dimensions aimed at mimicking geological fracture networks. The main feature of the DFN model is the power-law fracture length distribution and the fractally distributed fracture centres. Several key network properties have been analysed such as degree distribution, degree correlations, clustering and efficiency. It has been shown that the degree distribution follows a power-law, p(k) kαk where αk is dependent on the fracture length power-law exponent αl, and insensitive to the fractal dimension D2 of the fracture centre distribution. The nodes of the network are more likely to link to nodes of similar degree and the networks are therefore assortative. Both the clustering and the efficiency of the network have been shown to depend on the fracture length distribution, with an increase of both clustering and efficiency for higher αl. Finally the networks are classified as small-world networks, giving important implications for the transport and stability properties of the networks.

AB  - This study discusses the validity and usability of land use as an aspect of sustainable building. Buildings have an effect on land use not only because of the extraction and processing of raw materials and disposal of wastes but also because buildings occupy land during their entire service life. In addition, location of buildings has an effect on the need of networks – such as traffic networks – and their land use. Land use related indicators are typically included in the European voluntary assessment systems of sustainable buildings. ISO 21929-1 defines two land use indicators for buildings: soil sealing and land use change. However, there is neither consensus nor a harmonised method to assess this issue. As an example, land use was not included in EN 15978:2011 due to lack of agreement on a calculation method. This study outlines the environmental aspects of buildings’ land use, assesses the significance of land use that happens because of the land occupation of buildings compared to the land use because of the extraction of raw materials needed for the construction of buildings. The study has also includes information about the benchmarks of buildings in terms of land use related indicators, discusses, ands make conclusions about the compatibility of building level indicators with the urban level indicators.

AB  - Phylogenetic methods for the analysis of species data are widely used in evolutionary studies. However, preliminary data transformations and data reduction procedures (such as a size-correction and principal components analysis, PCA) are often performed without first correcting for nonindependence among the observations for species. In the present short comment and attached R and MATLAB code, I provide an overview of statistically correct procedures for phylogenetic size-correction and PCA. I also show that ignoring phylogeny in preliminary transformations can result in significantly elevated variance and type I error in our statistical estimators, even if subsequent analysis of the transformed data is performed using phylogenetic methods. This means that ignoring phylogeny during preliminary data transformations can possibly lead to spurious results in phylogenetic statistical analyses of species data.

AB  - With the rise of ubiquitous computing in recent years, concepts of spatiality have become a significant topic of discussion in design and development of multimedia systems. This article investigates spatial practices at the intersection of youth, technology, and urban space in Seoul, and examines what the author calls ‘transyouth’: in the South Korean context, these people are between the ages of 18 and 24, situated on the delicate border between digital natives and immigrants in Prensky’s [46] terms. In the first section, the article sets out the technosocial environment of contemporary Seoul. This is followed by a discussion of social networking processes derived from semi-structured interviews conducted in 2007–2008 with Seoul transyouth about their ‘lived experiences of the city.’ Interviewees reported how they interact to play, work, and live with and within the city’s unique environment. The article develops a theme of how technosocial convergence (re)creates urban environments and argues for a need to consider such user-driven spatial recreation in designing cities as (ubiquitous) urban networks in recognition of its changing technosocial contours of connections. This is explored in three spaces of different scales: Cyworld as an online social networking space; cocoon housing—a form of individual residential space which is growing rapidly in many Korean cities—as a private living space; and ubiquitous City as the future macro-space of Seoul.

AB  - Based on the model of network cities and by law of primate city and rank-size rule, we have analyzed the feature of the spatial structure system in Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations. The structure suggests that the network nodes of Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations are divided into five levels, and the cultivation direction is to develop the fourth node cities, such as Ningxiang, into the third-node cities, such as Xiangxiang, Liuyang, etc.. Then, we proposed the development scenarios of Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations network spatial structure system from node complement, channel optimization, nodes increase and city coordination. It's very meaningful for the model and scenarios to build and plan network spatial future models reasonably, and strengthen collaboration and the overall competitiveness in middle urban agglomerations.

AB  - With the almost ubiquitous availability of wireless communication networks and the increasing communication capabilities of electronic devices, the prediction that most devices are constantly connected to the Internet is fast becoming a reality. Furthermore, the speed of the wireless networks is increasing at a fast rate. In a vehicular environment, passengers and vehicular sensors can access services in the Internet by utilizing a mobile network architecture which connects the vehicular network to the Internet through heterogeneous of a mobile network architecture using mobile routers, e.g. the NEMO architecture, allows the devices within the vehicle to connect to a vehicular wired or wireless local area network. The mobile router can then forward data between the local area network and the Internet using multiple access networks, external antennas outside the vehicle, and higher transmission power. These characteristics of the NEMO architecture increase the number of connectivity options to the devices connected to the vehicular network, thus increasing the available bandwidth and decreasing the cost of communications. However, the long latency of handoffs, and the overheads of the protocols involved in NEMO may limit the benefits and applicability of a NEMO based architecture. This chapter presents a mobile network architecture which addresses the handoff delays and protocol overheads of NEMO. The feasibility of the architecture is evaluated by comparing its performance with state of the art proposals using both analytical and empirical data.

AB  - This article presents an analysis of the determinants of connectivity change in the world city network (WCN). Drawing on the theoretical research of Saskia Sassen and the subsequent empirical research of the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) group, connectivity in the WCN is measured through the networked location strategies of globalised service firms. Based on a calculation of the total connectivity of 220 cities across the world for 2000 and 2004, a measurement of connectivity change is produced for this time-period. This measure of connectivity change is then used as the dependent variable in a linear regression model through which are tested a number of hypotheses concerning the determinants of connectivity change. The study analyses WCN change both in general and in sectoral terms, and also examines how the prior presence of service firms impacts connectivity change.

AB  - In its Resolution of 7 July 19861, the Council of the European Communities expressed its political will to implement a European programme of action against cancer. Among the priorities that it identified for attention was the need for the exchange of information and experience, particularly with regards to the preventive and early diagnosis programmes of the Member States. Such initiatives were reinforced with the establishment of the ‘Europe Against Cancer’ (EAC) programme, which included a branch of secondary prevention, i.e. systematic population-based screening for specific sites of cancer where such interventions had been judged to be effective.2 Acknowledging that some Member States were already considering a national breast screening programme, a plan was developed to enable each of the twelve Member States of the European Community to propose a pilot-screening project within its borders. The European Breast Screening Network (EBSN) thus created has now been in existence for more than a decade. The majority of its screening programmes have progressed through their implementation phases, have introduced continuing quality improvement procedures, and now have entered the phase of programme evaluation.

AB  - This paper describes a type of project that images a city as it might exist given the integration of hemostatic procedures within pedestrian networks during emergencies requiring full-scale egress from an urban core. It articulates the steps taken to integrate a pre-existing C++ hemostasis model (C. Jacob, 2008) into Maya software in order to describe how the project operates on a computational level. By projecting these agent-based logics directly into/onto each pedestrian in the city (the smallest unit of the system), egress-oriented infrastructure can shift from being extensively predetermined in form (concrete barriers, metal railing, police barricades, etc.), to something more intensively defined, real-time, and locally on-demand. These procedures are situated within a larger schema based on the structural principles of Norbert Wiener's cybernetic feedback loops, that acknowledge and allow for hybrid (top-down + bottom-up) awareness and control within systems. The project attempts to ally itself with emerging forms of network design with similar structural typologies supported through the use of personal mobile devices (PMDs) in urban environments.

The urban economics literature influenced by the Solow-Vickrey model has extensively studied the above relationship. In the present paper we re-examine the Solow-Vickrey model of the long narrow city by defining a new general mathematical formulation in which the urban shape is a function of the allocation of land for transport. We focus in particular on emergence conditions for different types of polycentric cities. The methodology discussed in the paper provides a new analytical framework for assessing the impact of urban transport flows on city growth.

AB  - The road pricing is regarded as a transport policy to realize the efficient use of urban network. The network analysis with variable demand has been often applied to describe the network level of congestion pricing on the urban network. In the study, the cordon pricing system is analyzed to implement in the urban area with practical approach. It is assumed that the congestion tolls are collected in crossing the cordon lines on the network. Therefore, the scale of cordon zones and the values of congestion tolls would be determined simultaneously to produce the maximum social net benefit. The combinatorial optimization with unit price is formulated. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied as a practical method to provide the solutions for the combinatorial optimization problem. As the pattern of cordon pricing is determined, the performance of system is estimated to confirm the applicability. It is concluded that the cordon pricing can be applied with the practical approach.

AB  - This study examined native bird communities in forest patches across a gradient  of urbanization. We used field data and multivariate statistical techniques to examine the  effects of landscape context, roads, traffic noise, and vegetation characteristics on bird  community composition in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A.). Landscape-level  variables, particularly those related to urbanization, were most important in structuring  forest bird communities. Specifically, we found that road density and amount of urban land  cover were the best predictors of species composition. We found that urban and rural bird  communities were quite distinct from each other. Rural communities had more long-  distance migrants and forest interior species but species richness did not differ between the  communities. Our results suggest some specific guidelines to target bird species of interest  both inside and outside of urban areas. For example, if increasing numbers of migratory  species is of primary concern, then conservation areas should be located outside of urban  boundaries or in areas with low road density. However, if maximizing species richness is  the focus, location of the conservation area may not be as important if the conservation area  is surrounded by at least 50 m of forest habitat in all directions.

AB  - The current trend towards promoting the conservation of ecosystems has resulted in various studies conducted to determine ways to establish an ecological network. As such, urban ecological networks challenge popular perceptions regarding green space planning and protection. They also emphasize the importance of green spaces as parts of an interconnected system for sustainable urban development. However, until now urban ecological networks have not been applied in urban planning.As a result, this study developed an urban ecological network planning (UENP) method based on urban ecology and landscape ecology theory in order to improve the stability of urban ecosystems. First, the evolving definition of an ecological network was examined. Next, the UENP model was established with a focus on green space and land management. Finally, as a case study, a UENP for northeastern cities within the Seoul Metropolitan Area was conducted.Policy implications of these results are also presented. The UENP developed in this study consists of three stages of analysis: 1) green space assessment for urban ecological stability, naturalness, and biodiversity with consideration to development risks; 2) development of an urban ecological network using least-cost path analysis; and 3) examination results with a land use plan to minimize possible conflict. As an approach in urban sustainability, the UENP suggested in this study can be applied to urban green network planning and be used to control urban sprawl and promote biodiversity. © 2012 The Society of Urban Technology.

Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication.

AB  - Preservation of cultivated land is one of China's four basic strategic policies. Timely land use monitoring is a prerequisite of cultivated land management and sustainable utilization. Using digital satellite remote sensing techniques, the intention is to develop a workable procedure for cultivated land change detection in the Yellow River delta region. Four detection methods were assessed. The assessment, in general, suggests that it is difficult to find a single efficient method for cultivated land change detection in the study area, where spectral confusion is widespread due to soil salinization and juxtaposed land use patterns. The knowledge-based visual change detection and classification-result overlay methods are more appropriate than the multi-temporal composite and classification, and image ratioing. The latter two methods are useful and efficient when remote sensing data acquired in the suitable season are available, and distinct spectral characteristics of different land use types exist. The results show that the area of cultivated land in this region decreased by 5321.8 ha over the period 1987 to 1998, i.e. 483.8 ha every year, mainly concentrated in the central paddy field region and northeast dry land region

AB  - Efforts to make digital transactions secure are often necessary but never suf- ficient enough to increase the willingness of the transaction partners to actually carry out the transaction. As we shall see in section 2, besides security two more requirements have to be fulfilled in order to increase this willingness. First of all, the measures for the reduction of insecurity must be noticed by the transac- tion partners and they have to become familiar with them TaThOO. Second, there always remains a residual insecurity which can be compensated for only by building up trust in the partner and in the IT-system used. At the moment, the first signals of a beginning paradigm shift can be detect- ed: thinking in the dimension of security is followed by thinking about the factor of trust as the ultimate and decisive indicator for the willingness to actually car- ry out transactions in the network economy. This paradigm shift is characterized by the following corner-stones : the belief in the sufficiency of objective technical and legal security is fol- lowed by an increasing interest in the question of what actually determines the users' trust in digital transactions and how it develops, the assumption that security building components (SBCs) also increase the subjectively perceived security is followed by efforts to increase trust in se- curity building components and in the corresponding transaction partner by trust building components (TBCs) and finally, the point of view that security is something that a system should have to the highest possible extent is followed by the perspective that trust can be con- sidered as an essential source of sustainable competitive advantages. In the future, it might well be necessary that progress in the development and the use of trust building components at least catches up with the progress in security building components, so that the possibilities of the network economy can actu- ally be fully exhausted and that businesses are able to build up sustainable com- petitive advantages. A closer look at this situation leaves one with the impression that by far not all of the relevant dimensions of trust in digital transactions have been equally put on the research and development agenda and therefore existing solution ap- proaches cannot be as efficient as one hoped they would be. Thus, the second chapter of the present paper tries to show the complex in- terrelation between benefit, insecurity and trust with the willingness to actually carry out a digital transaction. The third chapter classifies existing control sys- tems for security building, whereas the fourth chapter classifies measures for trust building. This classification includes current fields of research, products, legislative actions, committees and a survey of the literature. The fifth and final chapter depicts ways to implement the paradigm shift.

But a lot of things have happened since the new GaWC data were collected in the first half of 2008: place-based public finance has had to come to the rescue of network-based private finance. The nationalization (part, full or implicit) of financial services firms has brought territories and their boundaries back to the centre stage of the world economy at the expense of networks and their flows. Put another way, the relations between cities and states are being readjusted in the latter's favour as globalization faces its greatest challenge. So what I am presenting is the latest but not up-to-date results on the world city network. This can be interpreted as measurement of the world city network prior to the effects of the current geoeconomic transition being realized: it is the ‘before' position to be compared to subsequent research on the ‘after' position in, say 2010 (Taylor et al 2009).\n\nBut before we come to these latest results I have to introduce the GaWC approach to measuring the world city network.

AB  - Recent research on measuring world city network formation has shown a mixture of hierarchical and regional tendencies. Using specially created data, the relative importance of these tendencies, and different regional sets of world cities, are evaluated using a discriminant analysis research model. It is found that regionality is at least as important as hierarchy amongst world cities. This contradicts the world city literature where the concept of a “world city hierarchy” dominates and regional patterning of world cities is relatively neglected. As well as suggesting a reorientation in world cities research, these findings have wider implications for globalisation in general. The latter is not, and I argue cannot, produce a homogeneous global space, which is what a single global hierarchy implies. Rather, it is always the case that globalisation processes simultaneously create more than one large scale of social activity.

In contrast to typical urban-suburban landscapes with a dominating core city in the centre, the  study  area  consists  of  several  sub  centres  and  a  large  number  of  small  rural  settlements  all  growing  in  different  ways.  Analyses  of  settlement  growth  in  the  Rhine  Valley  showed  that  migration  is  not  the  major  driver  for  enlargement  of  residential  areas.  Other  driving  forces  were identified and a cause-effect-chain was proofed statistically and quantified.   The settlement growth model is based on a multi agent system which simulates the allocation  decisions of households and companies. Validation of the model is performed by control runs  for  the  past  decade  comparing  model  results  with  corresponding  land-use  classifications  derived from earth observation. The results shown in this paper will focus on the comparison  of statistical parameters on the municipal level.

AB  - World Cities are acknowledged to be a key aspect of globalization. In many accounts, these cities are depicted as rivals in a global marketplace, their economic success a result of their competitive advantage. However, what has not been fully acknowledged is their connectivity and, in addition, the time and effort taken by specific ‘attendants’ to produce the World City network. Accordingly, this article aims to advance understanding of World City network formation by developing a conceptual model that focuses on four major attendants (firms, sectors, cities and states) that enact network formation through two nexuses – ‘city-firm’ and ‘state- sector’ – and two communities – ‘cities within states’ and ‘firms within sectors’. The utility of this model is demonstrated by drawing upon interviews conducted in offices of 39 advanced producer service firms in banking and law. These interviews were undertaken in three World Cities (London, New York and Singapore) in the wake of the East Asian financial crisis, an event that challenged the consistency of the World City network. Showing how attendants sought to maintain and transform the World City network at this key moment of crisis, we conclude that studies of city competi- tiveeness ultimately need to focus on the cooperative work that sustains global networks.

AB  - In a 2011 paper, I introduced the conceptual distinction between positions of centrality and power in world city networks and offered a new measure--now called alter-based centrality--designed to quantify the network positions of cities. Here, I respond to some conceptual and mathematical critiques of those ideas raised by Boyd et al. (2013) in their Comment on Neal (2011). On the conceptual side, I clarify the definitions of centrality and power, the relevance of exchange power in world city networks and the appropriate depth of network measures in this context. On the mathematical side, I clarify the relationship between alter-based centrality and other measures, and explore the limitations of two alternatives: eigenvector and beta centrality. This Reply concludes by noting that each measure has its own strengths and weaknesses, but that researchers should aim to use measures that are no more complex than necessary.

AB  - Drawing on previous specification and measurement of the world city network, this paper develops an exploratory research design using principal components analyses. Multiple solutions are used to explore the structure of a matrix defined by 123 cities and 100 global service firms in which the cells indicate the value of the firm's office in that city. Principal components analysis produces clusters of cities based upon similar profiles of service firms. Using 13 separate analyses, the main finding is a prime structure consisting of Outer cities, US cities, Pacific Asian cities, Euro-German cities and Old Commonwealth cities. Other secondary structures are also found. The end-result is a new geography of globalisation as indicated by configurations of the world city network. © 2002 The Editors of Urban Studies.

This article situates the phenomenon of Touba's globalisation within current literature on the global city and world city networks. It assesses four of the processes through which the holy city's values and structures are diffusing across the global North. First, the universality of Touba in Murid historiography is considered. Secondly, the diffusion of the toponym 'Touba', through the naming of expatriate associations and institutions, is analysed. Thirdly, the types and distribution of businesses set up in the US by Murids is assessed. Fourthly, the diffusion of typical Murid images is discussed as they too contribute to Touba's international renown.

AB  - Network analysis (NA) is a set of integrated techniques to depict relations among actors and to analyze the social structures that emerge from the recurrence of these relations. The basic assumption is that better explanations of social phenomena are yielded by analysis of the relations among entities. This analysis is conducted by collecting relational data organized in matrix form. If actors are depicted as nodes, and their relations as lines among pairs of nodes, the concept of social network changes from being a metaphor to an operative analytical tool which utilizes the mathematical language of graph theory and of matrix and relational algebra. Although deterministic approaches usually emphasise that NA enables study of how the social structure of relationships around a person, group, or organization affects behaviors and attitudes, structurally bounded purposive actions may affect the social structure and vice versa. NA can be regarded as a set of techniques with a shared methodological perspective, rather than as a new paradigm in the social sciences. NA techniques allow researchers to specify empirical indicators and to control field hypotheses through the definition and measurement of traditional catch-all concepts like social structure and cohesion.

AB  - Does the Randstad Holland function as a coherent system of specialised and complementary cities? This question is researched on the basis of an anlysis of commuter flows and regional employment data.\nIn recent years the concept of city networks has been introduced in Dutch spatial planning [Ministry of HSPE, 2004]. In previous policy documents the 'daily urban system' was considered as the level at which main interactions took place. However, an (assumed) expansion of the span of activities to larger networks underlies the new policy. The relationships with other cities or 'daily urban systems' in the region are gaining importance over the relationships between urban centres and their suburban areas. Specialisation of centres within this network and, as a result of that, complementarity are factors in this process.\n\nIn the Netherlands the Randstad Holland, the western most urbanised part of the country, is viewed as an example of the expansion of urban interaction to a polycentric city network. In a recent study, the Dutch National Institute for Spatial Research is looking for answers to the question to what extent specialisation en complementarity of centres within the city network Randstad actually occur. Furthermore, the study aims to find out whether this leads to functioning as a city network. In other words: does the city network Randstad exist or is it still nothing more than a group of 'daily urban systems' located relatively close to each other.\n\nIn this paper we present the results of an analysis of commuting patterns within the Randstad region. This analysis is based on data from the EBB (survey of the working population), which allows us to differentiate between educational and occupational groups and between economics sectors. In this way, changes in the commuting pattern between 1992 and 2002 can be analysed in relation to sectoral developments in the regional economy of the Randstad. Do these changes show a development of the Randstad in the direction of a system of specialised, complementary cities, in other words into a city network? To answer this question we follow the method of analysing spatial interaction proposed by Limtanakool e.a.s [Limtanakool et al, 2005a and b]. This method measures three aspects of relationships, e.g. strength, connectivity and symmetry. Taken together, these aspects can be seen as indicators of the level of hierarchy within the network (monocentric vs. fully polycentric). Differentiation between groups of workers and economic sectors allows will generate more insight into the mechanism of specialisation and complementarity: between complementary cities we expect symmetric flows when aggregate commuting flows are analysed, but we expect more asymmetric flows for groups and sectors with a high level of spatial specialisation. For the analysis, the Randstad region is divided in nine urban regions and their position in the network will be assessed. For comparison, several urban regions in the rest of the Netherlands as well as the Green Hart of the Randstad and its green belt will be considered as sending and/or receiving nodes.

AB  - There are three purposes: (1) to illustrate diversity amongst world cities; (2) to show how this reflects/constitutes power relativities between cities; and (3) to place debates on diversity and power on a firm empirical basis. The power of cities is interpreted both as a capacity ("power over") and as a medium ("power to"). World cities are treated as global service centres and the world city network is conceptualised as being "interlocked" through provision of business and financial services by global firms. The study is primarily empirical and uses a global data set comprising information on 100 global service firms in 123 world cities. Seven different ways of measuring and illustrating power differentials are presented: global network connectivity, banking/finance connectivity, dominant centres, global command centres, regional command centres, high connectivity gateways, and gateways to emerging markets. These categories have been identified before but never specified as comprehensively and rigorously as here. Whereas power as command power is concentrated in the USA, western Europe and Tokyo, network power is much more geographically diffused transcending the old "North-South divide". Finally the focus on diversity makes problematic the lazy policy tendency for emulation of a few well-known "global cities". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several hypotheses concerning implementations of associative memory in the brain rely on analyses of the capabilities of simple network models. However, the low connectivity of cerebral networks imposes constraints which sometimes do not arise clearly from such analyses. We investigate an aspect of a simple, dilute network's operation that is sometimes overlooked, namely the setting of activation thresholds. An examination of several criteria for optimal threshold assignment affords several new insights. It becomes apparent that the network's capacity (which is simply derived) is insufficient to characterize the quality of its performance. We derive the degree of 'sparsification' or decrease in firing probability that arises from dilution, and also the consequent losses in representational ability, and propose that they should also be taken into account. To evaluate the model's performance and suitability, we argue that one should explicitly consider the trade-off that exists between storage of patterns and preservation of information, and its consequent constraints.

With a view to the rapidly rising urbanization, the attention is next focused on the emerging large cities in China to test the relevance of distance frictions - next to a broad set of other important explanatory variables - for digital connectivity. Various interesting results are found regarding digital connectivity within the Chinese urban system, while also here geography appears to play an important role.

It draws on the network model devised by the Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) research group to measure global connectivities for 132 cities across the world in 2000 and 2008. The measurements for both years are adjusted so that a coherent set of services/cities is used. A range of statistical techniques is used to explore these changes at the city level and the regional scale. The most notable changes are: the general rise of connectivity in the world city network; the loss of global connectivity of US and sub-Saharan African cities (Los Angeles, San Francisco and Miami in particular); and, the gain in global connectivity of south Asian, Chinese and eastern European cities (Shanghai, Beijing and Moscow in particular)

AB  - Cnidarians are primitive multi-cellular animals whose body is constructed of two epithelial layers and whose gastric cavity has only one opening. Most cnidarians are colonial. Colonial hydroids with their branched body can be regarded as a model for the whole phylum and are the most-studied cnidarian group with respect to developmental biology. Their colonies are constructed by repetition of limited number of developmental modules. The new modules are formed in the course of activity of terminal elements – growing tips of stolons and shoots. The growing tips of cnidarians, in contrast to those of plants, lack cell proliferation and drive morphogenesis instead by laying down and shaping the outer skeleton and formation of the new colony elements. Cell multiplication takes place proximally to the growing tips. Branching in colonial hydroids happens due to the emergence of the new growing tip within the existing structures or by subdivision of the growing tip into several rudi- ments. Marcomorphogenetic events associated with different variants of branching are de- scribed, and the problems of pattern control are discussed in brief. Less is known about genetic basis of branching control.

AB  - The current study investigates Ireland's approach to satisfying labour and skills demand through migration in the period 2004- 2010. The emphasis is on non-EU economic immigration but information is also provided on EU immigration where relevant. Policy information and data is provided on economic migrants, where relevant divided into highly skilled, skilled and low skilled workers. Ireland's policy on labour migration is to meet all labour and skills needs from within the enlarged EEA as far as is possible, and to limit non-EEA labour migration to that of the most highly skilled and hard to find workers. Data from the Quarterly National Household Survey show that the proportion of non-Irish nationals is lowest in the high occupational skill grouping. Within the non-Irish groups highly skilled occupations have been dominated by nationals from other EU15 States and by migrants from outside the EU. In skilled and low skilled occupations nationals from the enlarged EU (EU10/12) clearly dominate. The Irish employment permits system is described and assessed. It is shown that the system is lightly regulated and employer-led and that it functioned well during the boom in sourcing the workers required. With rising unemployment there are now only very limited skills shortages in Ireland. Recent changes to the economic permits system in light of the economic downturn are discussed. Employment permit data show that the percentage of employment permits refused more than doubled between 2008 and 2009 while the number of new permits issued fell by 54 per cent in the same period.

Instead of discussing contributions purely along traditional linguistic or disciplinary lines, the authors use a novel classification scheme to identify and categorize significant works according to their particular epistemological perspective, before describing noteworthy contributions of various academic disciplines by key authors and research themes. The most significant contributions to the study of urban form in Canada have come from two largely isolated camps: first, architects/planners, mostly from Quebec, who examine form as a relatively independent system and work in the tradition of the so-called Italian school of process typology; and secondly, predominantly anglophone urban and historical geographers who deal with built forms and urban morphogenesis as a product of external forces. Recent work suggests that the two solitudes may be coming together.

AB  - In the current debate on the world city network and inter-city connectivity, a large number of cities, particularly in developing countries, have received limited attention. Despite a growing interest in emerging market cities, many scholars still focus on the more affluent parts of the global economy. In an attempt to redress this imbalance, I present an assessment for use on cities that are not at the centre of the network; but what we consider `end nodes'. I build my argument on Taylor's interlocking model for assessing city connectivity and zoom in on the types of networks that non-hub cities create through their inter-linkages with so-called peer cities in the same economic sector. I take these ego networks as a starting point and then lead the argument on to view city networks from a non-hub perspective. This allows me to identify the existing linkages between different peer cities within as well as between selected city networks. The renewable energy business in India puts this argument to an empirical test. My findings confirm that this way of looking at city connectivity allows one to assess specifically for city end nodes and thereby contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the world city network.

AB  - MOLAND (Monitoring Land Cover/Use Dynamics) is a research project aiming to assess and monitor the evolution of urban and regional land use and traffic networks. The main aims of MOLAND are to offer planners and decision-makers at various levels reliable, up-to-date and harmonized information on land use changes and a tool for monitoring, analysing and forecasting such changes from the point of view of sustainable development. The method has been tested in more than 30 urban areas situated mainly in Europe. The study period covers 50 years from the 1950s to the late 1990s. The method is based on the usage of high-resolution satellite images such as IRS. Land use data are analysed and combined with statistical datasets in a GIS application to produce indicators for sustainable development. This paper looks at the principles and technical solutions behind the MOLAND method, a range of urban indicators derived from the airborne imagery and the potential uses of the method in urban monitoring and planning. Special emphasis is on the analysis of sustainability of urban development. The comparative examples are related to various land use indicators such as urban sprawl, re-use of abandoned land, accessibility to green urban areas and exposure to the nuisance of transport network. The paper also sheds light on the potential of combining information gathered by remote sensing with statistical data and how such a method can be used in urban and regional monitoring, planning and integrated impact analysis.

AB  - Although a, detailed empirical analysis of the world city network is essential to attain insight in its functioning, it can be noted that previous explorations have been restricted to analyses of a limited number of thoroughly connected cities. A major reason for the neglect of less connected nodes in this global urban network is the sparse evidence on their world city formation. Drawing on earlier specifications and measurements of the world city network, the present paper shows how fuzzy set approach and pattern recognition can assess the inherent vagueness in classifications of lower ranked world cities. The resulting taxonomy asserts the intertwining relational tendencies of 234 cities in 20 clusters. Key findings include the distinctive profiles of US cities, the marginal position of (sub-Saharan) African and Central American cities, and Miami's particular role as a gateway between Anglo- and Latin America. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The mechanisms, by which organ complexity increases during evolution, are poorly understood. Although all vertebrate lungs mediate gas exchange using specialized cells generated by an alveolar differentiation program, their complexity ranges from the two-tube amphibian lung to the tree-like mammalian lung. Little is known about how branching morphogenesis, a newly-evolved process that builds the airway tree, integrates with the ancestral alveolar differentiation program. Here we show that a Sox9 gene network regulates lung complexity by integrating morphogenesis and differentiation during the development and evolution of the lung. In the mouse lung, Sox9 mediates the Fgf/Kras branching signal and suppresses precocious alveolar differentiation. This Sox9 gene network is absent in the Xenopus lung where there is no branching morphogenesis and all epithelial cells undergo alveolar differentiation. We propose that such dual-function gene networks are evolutionary advancements to increase organ complexity by delaying ancestral programs and promoting the integration of new programs.

AB  - An introductory level chapter. Cell migration is an important aspect of animal development, especially of vertebrates. Coalescence (convergent migration) of cells can drive morphogenesis—for example, in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum or the formation of the great blood vessels of vertebrates. Translocation and migration is also common—for example, of primordial germ cells and neural crest cells, while some cells (neurons) send out migratory cell processes. In all of these cases, migration is not random but guided, cells navigating in response to diffusible substances, surface-bound molecules, mechanical forces or electric fields. Responses to guidance factors are cell type-specific, so that different cells can interpret the same cue in different ways.

AB  - Conventional land administration systems rarely improve tenure security for the poor. Many people, especially poor and disadvantaged people, do not have their tenure relations to land included in a formal administration system with women, in particular, more likely to be excluded from such a system. Without recognized tenure rights, the poor lose the associated benefi ts such as: 1) improved tenure security; 2) increased investment in the land; 3) increased land value and marketability; 4) increased access to credit; and 5) fewer disputes and forced evictions. Also, local (and national) governments would not be able to better manage land use and development, and mobilize resources. © UN-Habitat / Danilo Antonio

AB  - On a regional scale, two types of polycentricity can be observed. The first involves polycentric metropolitan regions that have evolved in the course of post-suburban development around a previously monocentric city, whereas the second type involves neighbouring metropolises evolving into a multi-core polycentric metropolitan region due to an increase in the functional interaction between each other. The German urban system is characterised by both types of polycentricity. In this paper I examine the role of these two types of polycentricity within the context of globalisation. I address the question of whether individual metropolitan cores and metropolitan cores and their associated post-suburban areas share the global functions of a metropolitan region or whether such functions are concentrated in a single city within the metropolitan region. To this end, I analyse the locations of leading global advanced producer service firms in Germany in their role as sub-nodes of the world city network. Finally, I discuss the empirical findings in the context of modelling the world city network.

AB  - A Social network is a social structure made up of individuals called nodes which are tied by edges. One example of a source for social network analysis is traffic in a mobile telephony network where the subscribers are nodes and the edges are derived from the telecom traffic in the mobile telephony network. Mobile networks and other social networks of today contain millions of subscribers and the growth is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Many of the social network analysis algorithms are considered to be computationally expensive to execute. In this paper we describe the analysis and conclusions from our studies related to scalability for social network analysis algorithms. For some algorithms scalability is improved by introducing approximations in the existing algorithms. Many social network algorithms perform the analysis globally on the complete network. By performing the analysis for the closest neighbors to the target node, the ego network, the scalability is improved. Solutions for parallelized execution of the algorithms are also described. The most challenging part was to efficiently partition the network in smaller segments to prepare for parallel execution of the algorithms. A novel idea for handling pre- partitioning based on geographic location of the subscribers in a mobile network is described. As a proof of concept a prototype was implemented. Evaluation of our prototype implementation and ideas for further improvements are also described. Performance tests to compare the original with the improved social network algorithms and the parallelized solutions shows considerable improvements related to scalability. The trade off between capacity and quality of the results for these solutions and algorithms is also evaluated.

AB  - ‘Network City’, the latest 25-year planning strategy for metropolitan Perth, Western Australia, is designed to realise the integration of land use and transport networks within established and new areas. This article examines the influence of urban form on travel patterns and the case for sustainable travel outcomes in order to set in context the ‘Network City’ concept. The concept is described, and then the article focuses on the operational detail needed to progress towards fuller integration between the transport network and the city it serves. This includes analysis of urban structure in the context of the factors that influence efficient use of public transport: including residential density, intensity of activity and the hierarchy of activity centres. The implications for road planning are discussed where land use–transport integration is the core objective rather than simply traffic efficiency. If sustainable travel is to be facilitated there is a need to change both the operation of public transport and the urban structure and these changes are mutually supportive.

AB  - The distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (= serotonin = 5-HT) and noradrenalin (NA) in the enteric plexuses of the rat ileum was studied using immunocytochemical techniques. 5-HT-like immunoreactive fibers were observed only in the myenteric plexus, surrounding the ganglionic cells, which are all unreactive. NA-like immunoreactive fibers were present in all layers of the ileum: in the myenteric plexus, they were localized in the nodes, forming a network all round the neuronal perikarya; in the Meissner plexus, positive axons were arranged in a delicate network; submucosal blood vessels were often provided by NA-immunopositive nerve plexus. In the inner circular muscle layer the immunoreactive NA-positive fibers run within nerve bundles mainly parallel with the smooth muscle cells. The 5-HT immunoreactive material was depleted by treatment with reserpine; depletion of NA by 6-hydroxy-dopamine was also observed; on the contrary, no depletion of 5-HT by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine was obtained. To confirm the validity of these results, specific antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic 1-aminoacid-decarboxylase (AADC), two enzymes involved in the synthesis of catecholamines, were used. In conclusion these experiments indicate that 5-HT is present, probably as a transmitter, in certain fibres of the rat myenteric plexus, distributed in a way similar to that of NA-containing fibers. However, at variance with NA fibers, 5-HT fibers are not present in other regions of the intestine wall.

AB  - The primary objective of the research project was to develop an interactive decision tool (SNAMUTS) to assist in examining scenarios for the future growth of the Perth metropolitan area in activity centres framed around the accessibility of the transport network and the accessibility of place. The SNAMUTS tool enables the quantification of the effect of transport infrastructure improvements and modifications, and of land use intensification, on the accessibility of activity centres and corridors by different modes of transport. The SNAMUTS tool provides an in-depth examination of the potential accessibility by public transport to all centres across the metropolitan area. Accessibility is measured using an impediment variable that factors in travel time, frequency of service and transfers. In this way accessibility is measured from the perspective of a traveller who also has the choice of car travel to any location within the metropolitan area. In order to provide that choice across multiple journey purposes the inter-peak period is measured. SNAMUTS applies seven different accessibility indicators. Most measure different properties of the public transport network, including speed competitiveness with car travel; one measures the accessibility of place in terms of numbers of residents and jobs within the public transport catchment. A composite indicator for overall public transport accessibility is then compiled drawing on these indicators. A total of five future scenarios were developed to assess different assumptions for priorities in public transport service and infrastructure improvements, and (in four of these five scenarios) for the spatial distribution of urban growth in metropolitan Perth: Frequency Boost (FRB) examines the effect on network performance that can potentially be achieved in the short term by increasing service levels across the network without (or with only minor) adaptations to the physical infrastructure. Correspondingly, this scenario makes no assumptions for urban growth but is based on the same population and job numbers, and their spatial distribution, as the Status Quo scenario. The service upgrades included in the Frequency Boost scenario also form part of each subsequent scenario. • Light Rail Corridors (LRC), like the three subsequent scenarios, anticipates a growth in residents and jobs across metropolitan Perth of 42 percent to a total of 2.6 million between 2006 and 2031. It is based on accommodating all of this growth in the immediate vicinity of a network of linear activity corridors in the inner and middle suburbs anchored by a new seven-route, predominantly street-running light rail system. The focus is on corridors with existing concentrations of medium- density living and a relatively fine-grained mix of land uses. To achieve this scenario a building density roughly equivalent to R80 or a pattern of three to four- story row houses or apartments would be required, and in the CBD and some adjacent areas a building density of R160, which is generally achieved in Australian cities by mixing mid-rise (three to six-storey) development with some taller structures. Similar densities and building typologies already prevail in some of these areas. • Middle Ring Centres (MRC) selects growth nodes in the middle suburbs to accommodate all growth, and accesses these centres by a mixture of orbital rail extensions, a new two-route rapid light rail system and improvements to strategic bus corridors. Urban growth in the 19 designated activity nodes in this scenario will require an average density of 208 residents and jobs per hectare within the 800- metre radius of each centre. This is roughly equivalent to a density zoning of R160 and can be achieved by a uniform build-out of six to eight-storey apartment and office buildings, or by a mixture of low-rise (three to four storeys) and high-rise. structures. Activity nodes of such a typology and configuration can be found, for example, in Bondi Junction or Chatswood in Sydney. The Middle Ring scenario further assumes that the residential density of central Perth and central Fremantle will increase to reach a minimum density of residents and jobs of 104 per hectare. Overall however, the spatial expansion of the growth centres is quite modest on a metropolitan scale, with only 6% of the currently urbanised area affected. • Fringe Expansion (FEX) accommodates all urban growth in Greenfield areas in Perth’s outer suburbs and services these by several rail extensions and new rail routes, as well as a better connected, cross-suburban bus system. All 800-metre catchments of new train stations will be zoned and planned to accommodate about 10,000 residents and jobs each, which equates to an average density of 50 residents and jobs per hectare. Bus corridors across growth areas outside these station precincts will aim to achieve a similar density within 400 metres of the route. • Composite Wishbone (CWB) is a combination of those elements of the previous three scenarios that have the greatest positive effect on network performance. It allows for urban growth to continue simultaneously in intensification areas along new light rail corridors, designated middle-ring growth centres as well as new transit-oriented settlement areas at the urban fringe. The Composite Wishbone scenario envisions all new urban development to be public transport-oriented, including in Greenfield areas, which cater for about 20% of total growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol consumption has important health-related consequences and numerous biological and social determinants. OBJECTIVE: To explore quantitatively whether alcohol consumption behavior spreads from person to person in a large social network of friends, coworkers, siblings, spouses, and neighbors, followed for 32 years. DESIGN: Longitudinal network cohort study. SETTING: The Framingham Heart Study. PARTICIPANTS: 12 067 persons assessed at several time points between 1971 and 2003. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported alcohol consumption (number of drinks per week on average over the past year and number of days drinking within the past week) and social network ties, measured at each time point. RESULTS: Clusters of drinkers and abstainers were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to 3 degrees of separation. These clusters were not only due to selective formation of social ties among drinkers but also seem to reflect interpersonal influence. Changes in the alcohol consumption behavior of a person's social network had a statistically significant effect on that person's subsequent alcohol consumption behavior. The behaviors of immediate neighbors and coworkers were not significantly associated with a person's drinking behavior, but the behavior of relatives and friends was. LIMITATIONS: A nonclinical measure of alcohol consumption was used. Also, it is unclear whether the effects on long-term health are positive or negative, because alcohol has been shown to be both harmful and protective. Finally, not all network ties were observed. CONCLUSION: Network phenomena seem to influence alcohol consumption behavior. This has implications for clinical and public health interventions and further supports group-level interventions to reduce problematic drinking.

AB  - The interlocking network model has provided a framework for examining world city networks for over a decade. However, it implicitly adopts a 'brute force' perspective in which intercity linkages are forged by cities' sheer economic size. This paper develops a complementary 'sorting process' perspective in which linkages are viewed as arising from the complex process through which firms are sorted into cities. It describes a new statistical test and associated computer program (ONEMODE) that permit the identification of linkages forged by a menon-random firms-into-cities sorting process. Such linkages warrant particular attention because they are driven by deeper but often unknown forces. Networks implied by both perspectives are illustrated and shown to exhibit several expected similarities and differences. These networks provide complementary views of the global urban system that can be combined to obtain more comprehensive understandings of the world city network. The paper concludes by discussing the approach's limitations and directions for future research.

AB  - In recent years, network behaviour has been analysed extensively as the emerging model for economic growth. By network behaviour, a metaphor for co-operative behaviour among individuals, corporate or territorial partners is intended. This is increasingly becoming the reference paradigm in an era of continuing innovation and fast technological change, in the presence of 'market failure' where dynamic and innovative behaviours are concerned and of the high costs of a growth strategy based solely on internal know-how. The theory of the city network paradigm claims that, through participation in the network, cities exploit scale economies in complementary relationships and synergies in co-operative activities. In this sense, network advantage is a real club good, achieved only by those economic actors who are partners in the economic and spatial network, and is distributed among partners despite the private marginal costs each partner bears to participate in the network. In this sense, the private marginal costs of network participation differ from private marginal benefits, and network advantages turn out to be network externalities. The aim of the present paper is to measure the impacts that city network behaviour has on city performance-i.e. to provide a quantitative measurement of network externalities stemming from network behaviour in territorial systems.

AB  - This paper discusses the local planning of sustainable development in terms of urban governance. It is particularly interested to examine the grounds for the legitimacy of different actors and the process of legitimation in one urban network. Legitimation is understood here as a discursive process of acceptance in which the actors involved locate themselves and others in the structures of governance. The results indicate that people from the local community and local government justify their positions in the urban governance network and policy-making by means of traditional forms of authorisation - namely, in terms of expertise, representation or the common good. These characteristics have traditionally given legitimacy to the activities and decisions taken by public administration and government. In the case at hand, the traditional grounds for legitimacy are transformed into network-based practices, but those grounds are not pre-given for any of the parties involved. The future challenge in urban governance is to enable the formation of new kinds of political identities that are suitable for governance networks by reforming local discursive practices.

AB  - Time-lapse aerial photography over the Central Business Districts (CBD) of Austin and Dallas, Texas, has been employed to determine the averages of concentration, speed and fraction of vehicles stopped and to examine the relations among such network-wide averages including the flow which was measured on the ground simultaneously. The results have indicated that the average flow in a street network may indeed be expressed as the product of the space mean speed and concentration. Simultaneous ground experiments have also been conducted in the Austin CBD to investigate the reasonableness of the assumptions of the "two-fluid model," a curvilinear relation between the trip time and stop time per unit distance, which may be used in characterizing the quality of traffic service in urban street networks. As a result of these simultaneous ground experiments and aerial observations, the assumptions of the model have been verified. Moreover, relations between the fraction of vehicles stopped and concentration as well as between speed and concentration have allowed the two-fluid model to be used to compare the quality of traffic service in various street networks under the same level of concentration. The two-fluid model may then be used to predict, for a given change in vehicular concentration in a street network, the resulting changes in the averages of speed, fraction of vehicles stopped, flow, etc. This is particularly useful as a performance model in urban planning where for a given concentration it is desirable to predict the resulting traffic conditions.

AB  - This study explores the limiting properties of network-wide traffic flow relations under heavily congested conditions in a large-scale complex urban street network; these limiting conditions are emulated in the context of dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) experiments on an actual large network. The primary objectives are to characterize gridlock and understand its dynamics. This study addresses a gap in the literature with regard to the existence of exit flow and recovery period. The one-dimensional theoretical Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) only represents steady-state behavior and holds only when the inputs change slowly in time and traffic is distributed homogenously in space. Also, it does not describe the hysteretic behavior of the network traffic when a gridlock forms or when network recovers. Thus, a model is proposed to reproduce hysteresis and gridlock when homogeneity and steady-state conditions do not hold. It is conjectured that the network average flow can be approximated as a non-linear function of network average density and variation in link densities. The proposed model is calibrated for the Chicago Central Business District (CBD) network. We also show that complex urban networks with multiple route choices, similar to the idealized network tested previously in the literature, tend to jam at a range of densities that are smaller than the theoretical average network jam density. Also it is demonstrated that networks tend to gridlock in many different ways with different configurations. This study examines how mobility of urban street networks could be improved by managing vehicle accumulation and redistributing network traffic via strategies such as demand management and disseminating real-time traveler information (adaptive driving). This study thus defines and explores some key characteristics and dynamics of urban street network gridlocks including gridlock formation, propagation, recovery, size, etc. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Unified presentation of statistical models and methods from across the various disciplines engaged in network science Balanced presentation of concepts and mathematics Examples, including extended case studies, drawn from applications across the literature In the past decade, the study of networks has increased dramatically. Researchers from across the sciencesincluding biology and bioinformatics, computer science, economics, engineering, mathematics, physics, sociology, and statisticsare more and more involved with the collection and statistical analysis of network-indexed data. As a result, statistical methods and models are being developed in this area at a furious pace, with contributions coming from a wide spectrum of disciplines. This book provides an up-to-date treatment of the foundations common to the statistical analysis of network data across the disciplines. The material is organized according to a statistical taxonomy, although the presentation entails a conscious balance of concepts versus mathematics. In addition, the examplesincluding extended cases studiesare drawn widely from the literature. This book should be of substantial interest both to statisticians and to anyone else working in the area of network science. The coverage of topics in this book is broad, but unfolds in a systematic manner, moving from descriptive (or exploratory) methods, to sampling, to modeling and inference. Specific topics include network mapping, characterization of network structure, network sampling, and the modeling, inference, and prediction of networks, network processes, and network flows. This book is the first such resource to present material on all of these core topics in one place. Eric Kolaczyk is a professor of statistics, and Director of the Program in Statistics, in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University, where he also is an affiliated faculty member in the Center for Biodynamics, the Program in Bioinformatics, and the Division of Systems Engineering. His publications on network-based topics include work ranging from the detection of anomalous traffic patterns in computer networks to the prediction of biological function in networks of interacting proteins to the characterization of influence of groups of actors in social networks.

Aim of the\nstudy is to illustrate the potential of stated preferences techniques for placing a value on\nredevelopment and reuse alternatives for an underutilized site with high historical,\ncultural and architectural significance. Very few studies have used conjoint choice to\nassess public preferences for alternative land uses in an ex-ante framework, i.e. masterplans. In this paper we present the results of a conjoint choice study conducted on the Arsenal of Venice.\nWe surveyed individuals in Venice asking respondents to engage in conjoint choice tasks,\ngathering 168 usable observations. Members of the general public were intercepted at the\nMultimedia Library at Palazzo Querini Stampalia/FEEM and asked to indicate which\nchoice they preferrd among hypothetical-but realistic-redevelopment projects of the\nArsenale historic site. Each project was described by a vector of attributes, such as land\nuse, use of basins and waterways, architectural features, access, employment implied by\nthe reuse, and cost. The responses to these choice tasks was used to infer the rate at which\nrespondents trade off land uses, aesthetic features, and costs, and hence to derive the\nvalue of marginal changes in the attributes, and the value of a proposed policy package.

AB  - An illustrious scientist who was never really sure whether he was the author of his own works! Such was the impression D’Arcy Thompson gave when he presented his results. He compared them to the observations of his predecessors, as one should, but without really highlighting those points that would assure him priority. If an idea came into his head that he found interesting, it was as if, deep inside, a voice whispered to him that others had already had the same idea, maybe long ago. He searched for the source of the idea in more or less recent conversations with his family and friends, or buried himself in his books, including Ancient Greek literature, in which he was an eminent specialist at an early age, while his profession was teaching natural history to the students of Dundee University in Scotland. His biology lectures were well-researched and constituted the point of departure for profound reflections in the domains of mathematics, physics and chemistry, not to mention historical references ranging from Plato to Galileo or other, more recent authors [8, 11, 41]. This all bears witness to a fine eclecticism, the multiple facets of which have been rediscovered over the last forty years [3, 20, 36].

AB  - According to the morphological radiation principle (or the principle of initial morphological diversity) in the process of formation of new systems of an organism all functionally significant types of their organization that are possible on a definite morphological basis are formed and various inter-system connections are easily attained. Not infrequently a group solves new biological task owing to organs arising from different sources. An efficient method to reveal this regularity is to compare morphological differences in taxa of the same rank and the same phylogenetic stock. The highest morphological diversity (constructive diversity) is observed in groups in the basis of large phylogenetic branches, here differences can involve the basic plan of a certain phylum and types of morphogenesis characteristic of it.

AB  - This is an empirical paper that measures and interprets the position of Chinese cities in the world city network in 2010. Building on a specification of the world city network as a `interlocking network' in which business services firms play the crucial role in city network formation, information is gathered about the presence of global service firms in cities. This information is converted into data to provide the `service value' of a city for a firm's provision of corporate services in a 526 (cities) x 175 (firms) matrix. These data are then used as the input to the interlocking network model in order to measure cities' connectivity and its predominant geographical orientation. Here we focus on the position of some key Chinese cities in this regard, and discuss and interpret results in the context of the urban dimensions of the `opening up' of the Chinese economy.

A network model is used to assess the nature of change in intercity relations from 2000 to 2004. Data are collected for 2004 on the office networks of the same global service firms that were used to describe global connectivities for 315 cities in 2000. This allows a new cross-sectional geography of connectivities to be produced for 2004, and for changes in connectivities between 2000 and 2004 to be computed. Simple visualization and statistical techniques are used to explore the data. A distinction is made between ‘normal change’ and ‘exceptional change’ and only two cases of the latter are definitely identified: cities in both the USA and sub-Saharan Africa are generally losing global connectivity in relation to the rest of the world. Thus ‘normal change’ predominates and the paper concludes that contemporary intercity change does not correspond to Castells' image of an ‘urban roller coaster’. Taylor P. J. et ARANYA R.

AB  - Abstract. Confidentiality and data handling are important issues for social network users. Ideally, access control enforcement should not depend on the social networking provider but should be under the control of the user. In this paper, we propose a practical, SNS platform-independent solution, for social network users to control their data. We develop concepts that are general enough to describe access control restrictions for different SNS platforms. Our architecture uses encryption to enforce access control for users private information based on their privacy preferences. We have implemented our model as a Firefox extension.

AB  - Introduction: Transportation, as a facility, has made movements easier for humans. Over time, developments have contributed to better transportation. With increasing demand for better transportation systems, which is capital intensive, research and study have to be conducted to minimize costs and maximize benefits. In the development of urban network, one of the most important and critical problems encountered is locating land uses and existing route network. In other words, the layout of urban transportation network plays a significant role in urban landuse development. Some land uses are more sensitive to transportation environmental impacts. Therefore, there is a complex and dynamic relationship between landuse and transportation. Many researches were carried out in the past to visualize the desirable and undesirable situations of transportation in the field of urban landuse locations. Some researches had focused on individual fields, such as transportation, urban planning, accessibility and air pollution; while others were carried out involving more than one field. This research focuses on the issue of developing a spatial and mathematical model in optimizing distance of residential area from road (urban network). It requires understanding the main effective factors to develop this model. Different models of urban landuse and transportation contribute to this study. Urban models give expressions separately about urban landuse structure on which there is a significant influence by transportation planning. Useful models can be classified into several groups based on different criteria such as context, time, methods and tools. In this research, the relevant models on transportation and landuse were classified into: accessibility models (maximum distance) and air pollution models (minimum distance). In this study, air quality is chosen as a key element with respect to its critical roles in the quality of life and urban health. The overall objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to plan appropriate locations for residential land uses and urban transportation network development to address one issue-air quality. Arak, a developing city in Iran has been chosen as a case study. The methodology of this study helps to select suitable sites for the development of urban transportation network and residential zones. It covers reducing air quality by the definition of optimum distance between residential zones and roads based on mathematical model and good establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. GIS as a powerful tool is applied for overlaying layers and interpretation of several scenarios. The results show the mathematical model, with acceptable accuracy, can be applied for the establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. Based on the suitability maps, approximately around all main roads, there are non-suitable residential zones located in potential polluted areas. It will be dangerous for human health of residents. This research has successfully managed development of a scientific approach for current and future model development that can be employed in transportation planning and residential landuse suitability assessment at both local and national structure plan levels. Methodology: The main component of this study is a mathematical model to incorporate air quality and quantitative interpretation of accessibility associated with the residential zone development. This mathematical model was adopted to incorporate accessibility and air quality associated with residential zone development. It included the spatial and quantitative parameters relevant for the emissions and effects of pollutants in relation to urban transportation. Arc GIS 9.1 and Arc View GIS version 3.1 were used to provide the framework for the operation of the model for mapping air pollution. The availability of spatial data types and functionalities of the software influenced the model design and plan. Designing the decision model and plan was the major task of this research. The basic conditions in finding a good location were expressed under two questions: ii) What are the positive and negative effects (i.e. benefits and costs) of urban transportation network on its surrounding environment? ii) How are the good and bad locations (i.e. benefits and costs) of the residential zone related to the above-mentioned effects and surrounding affected environment? The basic idea behind these two questions is to examine the interactions of landuse and urban transportation network. Urban transportation network is defined as a mathematical representation of the physical transportation infrastructure in the city. This mathematical process is shown in Fig. 1. (Figure presented) Location of urban transportation network, largely determines how much area of urban land use can be accessed easily from origin to destination. It is considered a high-activity land use, as it attracts people and activities, resulting in higher environmental pollution around it, such as noise and air pollution. With the consideration of these characteristics, the urban transportation network should not be located close to residential land use, which requires a safe environment around it. So, residential land uses and transportation parameters should be considered in a balanced way, to get a suitable location for an urban transportation network which meets the transportation requirements of residents optimally. This decision making process has both spatial and non-spatial dimensions. In this study, a plan were developed, by mathematical and spatial approaches, which incorporated spatial and non-spatial criteria arranged to answer the two basic questions on the influence of transportation on the environment of surrounding land uses. With arranging these criteria to search for suitable locations of residential land use and urban transportation network, objectives and sub-objectives of the study could be obtained. It was also necessary to evaluate the plan and model through fieldwork, statistical tools and interview. Result and Discussion: The research outputs include mathematical model and its accuracy, potential locations for residential land use development, and existing suitable developed locations for residential land use. It shows how the developed mathematical model is utilized to achieve the objectives and sub-objectives of the research to finally identify the suitable locations for the residential land use. The mathematical model developed in this study comprised most of the criteria. Individual formulas and models of each criterion may not meet the objectives of the research individually. However, their preferences were incorporated in the final model. The structure of the developed model enables interactive modification by changing the weights and properties of the parameters. With respect to the scenarios analysis, economical and technical limitations, future development of residential land use and urban transportation networks in the study area will be possible based on the following priorities: a. Re-designation of transportation networks (with more replacing local road types by arterial roads) in existing non-suitable locations of residential land use, b. Development of residential land use and urban transportation networks in suggested locations for the future development of residential land use, c. Removing some unnecessary roads in existing non-suitable locations of residential land use, and d. Changing some of the residential land uses in existing non-suitable locations of residential areas. The research strategy is able to support urban planners with a range of options. However, for selecting the best or most suitable sites, more comprehensive model and plan can be deve loped, from which choosing the sites from the alternatives will be the main purpose. Several urban land uses and environmental impacts of transportation are not placed in the model and plan, because they are exclusive for the choice phase of the study. Implementation of method and scenarios analysis suggests that some areas can be more suitable for residential land use and urban transportation network development than others, if performances and criteria are considered carefully. This suitability largely d epends on the goals of the transportation projects; however, the importance of the main elements (air quality) cannot be ignored in all transportation projects. The method developed in this study is not suitable for exact site selection purpose. It may be used as a generalized spatial decision support tool to support decision-making for locating residential land use and urban transportation network. Development and implementation of methods in the study area have materialized the following results: a. Illustration of a new implementation using spatial method in urban transportation planning. Innovative GIS utilization in urban transportation can explain air quality. b. Development of a complex mathematical spatial decision support model for determining the location of residential land uses, in proportion to urban transportation network. c. Exploration and arrangement of a number of criteria or factors which could be interpreted to predict suitable land uses and urban networks location in quantitative framework. d. Illumination of the parallel important role of environmental and economical sectors and users impacted by urban travel and land use activity in spatial framework.

AB  - A well-developed acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive neuronal system could be demonstrated in the pineal organ of the palm squirrel. There are two longitudinal nerve tracts which run all along the margin of the pineal organ from its distal to proximal regions. These nerve tracts are confluent distally. Another short, but deep tract was seen in the middle part of the pineal organ which joins one of these tracts. A large number of AChE-positive neurons whose processes actually form the tracts are present all along the pineal organ. They are distinguished into multipolar and pseudounipolar/unipolar neurons. A few neurons seen outside the nerve tract form a network of nerve fibres among the pinealocytes and also link the main tracts. The nerve tracts appear wavy, irregular and tortuous. A large number of round ring-like bodies seen in close association with neuronal perikarya and nerves may represent the axo-somatic and axo-dendritic contacts.

Such biotechnological approach afforded ca. 4,300 plantlets from 20 explants, over a 6-month period, overcoming the drawback of the lack of propagation material. Typically, the results have led to the increase of the cultured area and juice production of that species coming true the goal of the partnership between the public and private sectors herein involved. The transference of the resulting technology was successfully performed to the company and a patent covering the biotechnological process has been recently requested to official organisms on behalf of the partners.

These improvements include turn-tables, dynamic segmentation, linear referencing, traffic lines and nonplanar networks. The chapter shifts attention also to network routing problems that have become prominent in GIS-T: the traveling-salesman problem, the vehicle-routing problem and the shortest-path problem with time windows, a problem that occurs as a subproblem in many time-constrained routing and scheduling issues of practical importance.

AB  - We introduce an open-source Urban Network Analysis (UNA) toolbox for ArcGIS, which can be used to compute five types of centrality measures on spatial networks – Reach; Gravity Index; Betweenness; Closeness; and Straightness. Though primarily developed for the analysis of urban street- and building-networks, the toolbox is equally suited for other spatial networks, such as building layout-, highway-, or utility networks. Unlike previous network analysis tools that operate with two network elements (nodes and edges), the UNA tools include a third network element – buildings – that are used as spatial units of analysis for all measures. Neighboring buildings on the same street segment can therefore obtain different accessibility results. UNA tools allow buildings to be weighted according to their characteristics – more voluminous, more populated, or otherwise more important buildings can be specified to have a proportionately stronger effect on the analysis outcomes. The paper demonstrates its application in Cambridge and Somerville, MA.

AB  - \nNetwork regions involve systematic communication and transaction linkages among nodes through networks of people and institutions intraregionally and globally. Well-networked regions are said to develop more accomplishment economically and socially, enriching their inhabitants accordingly. The network imagery began to be applied in the 1980s, with prefigurative concepts like [`]milieu' being advanced from the Francophone community of economic geographers. Later, the Italian interest in [`]industrial districts' led to exploration of networks in other contexts, including high-tech regions. Finally, these streams folded into a master-narrative of [`]regional innovation systems' (RISs) in which knowledge exploration and generation subsystems, interacting through private and public intermediaries (possibly also a subsystem) with the knowledge exploitation or commercialization subsystem, denoted a well-functioning RIS. These can be more entrepreneurially (ERIS) or institutionally (IRIS) inflected. They are found in developed and developing countries, notably China, but they are by no means ubiquitous. A further variation on [`]network regions' arises from research in [`]actor-network' theory. In this approach, also pioneered in innovation and science studies, actors network around projects ranging from [`]articulation of discourse' to rural food industries, to laboratory research. Some critiques of both approaches exist but they are weak and poorly targeted.

AB  - With the development of the urban social economy in China, the uncertain factors faced by urban network planners and their complexity are continuously increasing. In order to promote the scientific nature of urban network planning in China, the risks of urban network planning need to be identified and analysed systemically. Questionnaires about the risks of urban network planning in China were designed from the perspectives of policy, technology, economics and management. The membership degree of possibility, loss value and expected loss which affect the risks of the urban network planning in China were determined, based on the theory of fuzzy membership through statistical investigation and analysis. Key factors that should be considered in the future were determined. Those factors mainly include whether the government supports the urban power network plan, increases in the cost of levy land and immigration, grid project quality risk management, the deviation of load forecasting and so on. The method improves the comprehensiveness and objectivity of risk identification and provides a decision foundation for the risk aversion of urban power network planning in the developing countries.

AB  - The word ‘ganyu’ is widely used in Malawi to describe a range of short-term rural labour relationships, the most common of which is piecework weeding or ridging on the fields of other smallholders, or on agricultural estates. Ganyu is a crucial poverty issue in Malawi because: • After own-farm production, ganyu is the most important source of livelihood for most poor households – for some it is becoming even more important than own-farm production. • Ganyu is the most important coping strategy for most poor households in the crucial hungry period between food stores running out and the next harvest. • The need to do ganyu to obtain an immediate supply of food may conflict with own-farm production and therefore, while addressing an immediate crisis, can lock some households into a vicious cycle of food insecurity. • Low ganyu wage rates mean agricultural labourers do not earn sufficient incomes to invest in sustainable livelihood development. Despite the widespread practice of ganyu, and its importance to the poor, it is an under-researched component of the jigsaw that makes up the livelihoods of rural Malawians. This is a mistake, as ganyu is too important to the poor to be sidelined – it will play a critical role in future rural development strategies and has important interactions with the current debate about developing safety nets in Malawi. The paper discusses recent literature on ganyu and opens up a debate about various future scenarios and how different strategies may affect rural labour markets.

AB  - The Community Sustainability Assessment (CSA) was developed to assist communities in assessing their accomplishments and charting directions toward ever increasing sustainability. Like a Three Legged Stool, overall sustainability of a community (the seat) is upheld when each of the three legs is strong and balanced. In the CSA the three legs, each as important as the other, are the Ecological, Social and Spiritual aspects of community. The CSA is a subjective tool. This means that the person(s) completing it make their best judgments, and on some items guesses, as to what is true for their community. To get the most out of this exercise, community members may meet as a group and work through the CSA together. This offers a meaningful review of the community's accomplishments and areas for improvement. Low scoring items may be selected for community focus and action to improve sustainability, providing direction for the community's future. It is expected that communities actively planning and pursuing sustainability will score high, however, there is always room for improvement - from a high to a perfect score.

Functional polycentrism and urban network development in the Greater South East, United Kingdom: evidence from commuting patterns, 1981-2001, Regional Studies. In contemporary literature on changing urban systems, it is often argued that the traditional central place conceptualization is outdated and should be replaced by a network view that emphasizes the increasing criss-crossing pattern of interdependencies between spatial units. This paper tests how urban networks develop by looking at commuting patterns in the Greater South East, United Kingdom, for the period 1981-2001. Although the empirical results indicate that the Greater South East cannot be currently characterized as a polycentric urban region or an integrated urban network, there is some evidence for urban network development at the local, intra-urban, level, and a decentralization of the system at the regional, inter-urban, level. © 2010 Regional Studies Association.

AB  - The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

Networkers do use a specialized language for describing the structure and contents of the sets of observations that they use. But, network data can also be described and understood using the ideas and concepts of more familiar methods, like cross-sectional survey research. On the other hand, the data sets that networkers develop usually end up looking quite different from the conventional rectangular data array so familiar to survey researchers and statistical analysts. The differences are quite important because they lead us to look at our data in a different way - and even lead us to think differently about how to apply statistics.

AB  - World cities are acknowledged to be key aspects of globalization. In many accounts, these cities are depicted as rivals in a global marketplace, their economic success a result of their 'competitive advantage'. However, what has not been fully acknowledged is their connectivity, and the time and effort taken by specific 'attendants' to produce the world city network. Accordingly, this paper aims to advance understanding of world city network formation by constructing a conceptual model that focuses on four major attendants (firms, sectors, cities and states), whose co-efficiencies enact network formation through two nexuses - 'city-firm' and 'state-sector' - and two communities -'cities in countries' and 'firms within sectors'. The utility of this model is demonstrated by drawing upon interviews conducted in seventy offices of 39 advanced producer service firms in banking and law. These interviews were undertaken in three world cities (London, New York, and Singapore) in the wake of the East Asian financial crisis, an event which challenged the consistency of the world city network. Showing how attendants sought to maintain and transform the world city network at this key moment of crisis, this paper concludes that studies of city competitiveness ultimately need to focus on the co-operative work that is expended in sustaining global networks.

In this article, the design and evaluation of a gaming-scenario experiment for the exploration of development planning in an urban network in the Netherlands is presented. Two gaming sessions were held using two long-term scenarios (2030) as varying contexts. The combined gaming-scenario approach made it possible to evaluate the impact of external future developments and trends on the administrative and spatial development. Evaluation results of the gaming experiment indicate that the gaming-scenario approach generated new and critical insights on development planning and the future of the urban network. Through the game, the principal, the game leaders but most of all the stakeholder-participants experienced and realized that the management of development planning in urban networks is a very difficult task and is full of pitfalls. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

They emphasize the links between regions and foreign markets, a relationship which has been neglected by most researchers.

We ordinarily repre- sent filiation by a set of arcs (descent arcs) that are directed from parents to children, and marriage by a set of undirected edges (marriage edges) between spouses (for alternative representations of kinship networks without edges, see below). Kinship networks thus are mixed graphs, contain- ing both arcs and edges.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development has led to a paradigm shift in urban planning in European cities. In recent years air pollution, traffic noise and loss of open space and more recently energy scarcity and climate change have become leading issues of urban planning. This paper looks into the achievements and challenges of transport and land use planning in European cities today. It starts with an overview on current policies at the European level to promote a better integration of transport and land use planning in European cities, summarises the results of studies on integrated transport and land-use strategies and presents examples of successful best practice in this field in European cities. To demonstrate the magnitude of the challenge, it presents results of the EU project STEPs (Scenarios for the Transport System and Energy Supply and their Potential Effects), which examined the impact of different scenarios of fuel price increases, resulting market responses and different combinations of transport and land use policies on regional economic development, travel patterns and the environment in metropolitan areas using several European and urban/regional simulation models.

AB  - Discovering traffic bottlenecks and taking action to alleviate congestion to enhance the performance of a traffic network are the most important tasks for the advanced traffic management system in the intelligent transportation system. However, traffic bottlenecks are affected by several factors and vary with spatial and temporal environments, which makes them difficult to define and discover. This paper proposes a three-phase spatiotemporal traffic bottleneck mining (STBM) model, including several spatiotemporal traffic patterns and STBM algorithms that use the raw data of location-based services to discover urban network spatiotemporal traffic bottlenecks. This paper implements an STBM prototype system based on a taxi dispatching system in a Taipei, Taiwan, urban network. The experimental results show that the congestion prediction capability of the proposed heuristic methods (congestion-propagation heuristic) is up to 79.6% during workdays and 72.1% on weekends, which outperforms other methods (e.g., the congestion-converge heuristic, the congestion-drop heuristic, and congested object item), and the discovered spatiotemporal bottlenecks match the travelers' experience.

AB  - States compel children to attend school; in fact, 98% of all school-age children attend schools--irrespective of conditions. Yet the environmental conditions of decayed facilities or facilities close to hazards can damage children's health and ability to learn. At the same time, it is well documented that healthy school facilities can help children learn, grow, and stay healthy. Today, justice for children can be achieved, but that demands swifter, surer progress on federal, state, and local fronts to ensure that all children have environmentally healthy schools that are clean and in good repair--and when children do not, that they have timely on-site public health interventions to help reduce exposures and have necessary support services. This is a profound pediatric health and environmental justice issue that must not be set aside. "Towards Healthy Schools 2015: Progress on America's Environmental Health Crisis for Children" is the third triennial state-by-state data and policy report on this topic since 2006. "Sick Schools" (2009) and before it "Lessons Learned" (2006) researched and assessed state-by-state data and policies on environmental conditions at schools and risks to children's health, compiling them into a single, unique resource that painted a deeply disturbing picture, in which vulnerable children endure unhealthy schools. "Towards Healthy Schools 2015" cites, as did the two previous reports, basic federal data for public schools, such as total number of buildings; total enrollment; total number of personnel; percentage of children with asthma; percentage of children without health insurance; total number of children receiving special education; total number of children of minority status; and more. New in this edition are three data sets used to illustrate additional risk factors not covered in the first two reports: (1) total number of children eligible for free or reduced price meals (a proxy for poverty status); (2) states requiring schools to keep asthma/allergy incident reports; and (3) states requiring inspection of school drinking water outlets for lead. Appended are: (1) State Data Table Footnotes; (2) US Environmental Protection Agency: Office of Children's Health; (3) US Department of Education: Green Ribbon Schools; (4) Map: School Equity Funding Lawsuits in the States; and (5) Coalition for Healthier Schools: Position Statement and Policy Recommendations.

AB  - In order to create the contents of an address gazetteer service that forms part of a city council Spatial Data Infrastructure, all the existent repositories containing address information in the different council offices must be analyzed and harmonized. The problem is that usually these repositories are constrained by the use of different taxonomies for the identification of urban network feature types. The objective of this work will be to describe how to establish a formal ontology enabling the interoperability among the different taxonomies, and facilitating the construction of the gazetteer contents.

AB  - This paper is devoted to foreign direct investments (FDIs), which have been allocated on a very low regional level. This makes it possible to first position Vienna within a global city system according to international capital flows and to analyze changes in this position. In addition to being a case study, this paper shall attempt to make a contribution to the conceptualisation of global cities as focal points of FDI-capital flows and the formation of a global city network by firm hierarchies. The dataset is used to analyze Vienna's FDI-relations to other cities and makes it possible to examine spatial hierarchies based on uneven capital flows. As the data extend over a period of 17 years (from 1989 to 2005), the question can be posed whether geostrategic changes like the fall of the Iron Curtain and Austria becoming a member of the EU have led to new patterns of capital flows. It could be established that there is an ongoing degree of hierarchization within Vienna's global city network and that the above mentioned changes in the "long decade of the 1990s" established Vienna as a gateway-bridge between the East and the West. On a global scale, however, Vienna's city status was not raised in the process. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - After the shock to the global financial system and world economy in 2008, 2009 was a year of appraisal and adjustment. The risk landscape that this report has explored over the past five editions has in fact changed remarkably little. What has changed dramatically is the level of recognition that global risks, like the world, are now tightly interconnected and shocks and vulnerabilities are truly global, even if impact and response can still differ at the “local” level. This recognition is illustrated by the increased number of interlinkages on the 2010 Risks Interconnection Map (RIM)1.

AB  - abstractComparative studies of urbanisation can be characterized by their emphasis on the\nquantitative and visual aspects of urban growth, which is amongst other things reflected\nin the analysis of spatial patterns and rates of urban population growth. The visual aspects relate both to the spatial realisation of the demand for urban land use and its functional variation. This emphasis can be understood from the perspective\nof the ongoing process of urban industrial growth in the industrialised countries during the 19th and most of the 20th century. Most of the concept and models we use have been developed during this period of urban transition and relate to this\nexperience. However, in the last quarter of the 20th century this process came to an end as the urbanisation process in its present form was completed. This leads to the following questions. First, to what extent are the concepts and models derived throughout this period still valid? Second, if this is not the case, to what extent do\nthey need adjustment and third, what kind of new approaches are required?\nIn this paper the focus will be cities as part of an urban system and will deal with two issues, viz. the relation between spatial scales, i.e. vertical linkages and the relation between cities, especially focussed on their horizontal linkages or network characteristics. These two issues will be discussed against the background of the completion of three long-term developments: (1) the completed first demographic transition, (2) the completed process of industrialisation and (3) the completion of three infrastructural revolutions. This analysis will indicate the direction in which the environment has changed, the consequences of this change for the  conceptualisation of the process of urbanisation and for the characteristics of the process it self.\nThe consequences of these changes will be discussed using empirical examples from the Netherlands and other parts of Europe both for models of internal urban structure and for the city system at large. The classical unity between territory, economic and social functions is broken up and has lead to a decoupling of functions both in a spatial and in a functional sense. The latter has resulted in a process of spatial rebundling of activities.\nIt will be argued that new rationalities are needed to understand the contemporary realisation of the spatial outcome of the demand for space use. In addition to this, it has also been argued that new and different types of uncertainties emerge. The latter are related to the increased importance of micro processes in the demand for space use. This in turn has consequences for spatial policy, as it will lead to considerable mismatches between national planning goals and actual realisations. \nIt is suggested that a process approach is needed to deal with these uncertainties.text

AB  - This article examines the link between cities and culture from the point of view of the production of cultural goods, including media products. It focuses on the institutional structure of present-day cultural production and the media industry and on their geographical organization at the local and global levels. The cultural economy is a prime mover for globalization processes in the urban system, in which cultural production clusters act as local nodes in the global networks of the large media groups. The models frequently used to analyse the global city system will be supplemented and partially modified by an empirical analysis of the 'world media cities'. The analysis of the world media cities enables those locations to be identified, from which globalization in the spheres of culture and the media proceeds and is 'produced' in practical terms. Global city research has predominantly emphasized the role of advanced producer services-in contrast this article concludes that for the process of globalization the globally operating media firms are at least as influential as the global providers of corporate services, because they create a cultural market space of global dimensions, on the basis of which the specialized global service providers can ensure the practical management of global production and market networks.

AB  - Information on air passenger flows is potentially a prime data source for assessing spatial patterns in the world city network, but previous analyses of this issue have been hampered by inadequate and/or partial data. The ensuing analytical deficiencies have reduced the overall value of these analyses. Therefore, this paper examines how some of these deficiencies might be rectified. First, it reviews the rationale for using airline data to analyse the world city network. Secondly, it assesses the problems encountered by previous research. The third section elaborates on the construction of a global intercity matrix based on the so-called Marketing Information Data Transfer database and explains how this matrix can circumvent some previously identified problems.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in working with local communities to establish marine protected areas to help conserve dwindling marine resources. Given the urgent nature of this problem, it is essential that project managers and communities learn how to best apply this approach and understand the conditions1 under which this strategy will most likely achieve success. In August 2000, and again in 2003, representatives of a number projects from across the Pacific and Southeast Asia came together in Fiji and the Philippines. Each of the projects is currently using some form of a locally-managed marine area (LMMA) strategy. The meetings were designed to allow these different projects to share and discuss their experiences in using locally-managed marine areas. From these initial meetings, representatives of some of these projects have agreed to work together and form a collaborative 'learning network' so that they can systematically share their knowledge and experiences about how to use this strategy more effectively and improve their conservation impact.2 This network is called the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) Network.

AB  - Silica-based materials are used in many high-tech products including microelectronics, optoelectronics, and catalysts. Siliceous sponges (Demospongiae and Hexactinellida) are unique in their ability to synthesize silica enzymatically. We have cloned the silica-forming enzymes, silicateins, from both demosponges (marine and freshwater sponges) and hexactinellid sponges. The recombinant enzymes allow the synthesis of silica under environmentally benign ambient conditions, while the technical (chemical) production of silica commonly requires high temperatures and pressures, and extremes of pH. Silicateins can be used for the fabrication of highly- ordered inorganic–organic composite materials with defined optical, electrical, and mechanical properties. The simple self-assembly properties of silicateins which are able to form silica and other metal oxides in aqueous solution allow the development of novel products in nano(bio)technology, medicine, and dentistry.

AB  - From a physicist“s point of view, and regardless of the genetic controls, the branching mechanisms of many organs and glands\n  look similar. Most generally, an epithelium forms a pouch-like sheet which elongates and branches repeatedly. During the final\n  steps of organogenesis, the mesenchyme is vascularized in a pattern greatly influenced by the branched epithelium so that\n  main vessels go down (arteries) and up (veins) the main ducts towards distal branches where exchange with capillaries is performed\n  over a very large total surface area. This principle of construction can produce a secretory or filtering or breathing organ\n  and most glands and organs are built in this way. There is either a common phylogeny to all branching organs (see Chapter\n  1), or there is some simple building principle which impUes easy construction and hence straightforward evolutionary convergence\n  (Fig. 1).

AB  - Preparation for global movement to urban regions requires a holistic study of infrastructure interactions. The impact of water and energy on one another has been studied to show how they are dependent upon one another. Other infrastructure interactions also are vital to designing more sustainable cities. The primary infrastructures are: water, energy, land use, and transportation. Creating more sustainable cities may involve low-impact development techniques, opting for compact living, and studying alternatives for water, energy, and transportation provision. Every city is different, and infrastructure decisions should be tailored to fit each city. This group is primarily focused on the greater Atlanta region and the Phoenix area.

AB  - At the beginning of Chapter 16, we discussed two fundamentally different reasons why individuals might imitate the behavior of others. One reason was based on informational effects: since the behavior of other people conveys information about what they know, observing this behavior and copying it (even against the evidence of ones own private information) can sometimes be a rational decision. This was our focus in Chapter 16. The other reason was based on direct-benefit effects, also called network effects: for some kinds of decisions, you incur an explicit benefit when you align your behavior with the behavior of others. This is what we will consider in this chapter. A natural setting where network effects arise is in the adoption of technologies for which interaction or compatibility with others is important. For example, when the fax machine was first introduced as a product, its value to a potential consumer depended on how many others were also using the same technology. The value of a social-networking or mediasharing site exhibits the same properties: its valuable to the extent that other people are using it as well. Similarly, a computer operating system can be more useful if many other people are using it: even if the primary purpose of the operating system itself is not to interact with others, an operating system with more users will tend to have a larger amount of software written for it, and will use file formats (e.g. for documents, images, and movies) that more people can easily read.
