AB  - The decision-making process can address the evaluation of an individual project or the comparison of multiple alternative projects. The first case examines the economic, financial and other impacts of carrying out a particular project. In the second case, the decision-making process is intended to help choose the best among different possible solutions whose economic or financial impacts have been previously determined. This chapter focuses on the activities relating to project evaluation and comparison. Economic and financial analysis techniques used in project evaluation such as Cost-Benefit analysis and Cost-Revenue analysis as well as Multi-Criteria analysis methods for the comparison of alternative projects are described in detail.

AB  - Urban containment strategies are one of the best-known planning instruments for managing urban sprawl. The two main types of such strategies are greenbelts and urban growth boundaries. The boundaries set by the Land Use Plan in Switzerland have been applied since 1970. We evaluate the effect and success of this strategy by analysing expansion of developed land, change in number of buildings, and building density within and outside building zones in four Swiss municipalities 1970-2000. Our results show that the boundary restricted most development to building zones and promoted increased building density. Generally, building density increased in the building zones but decreased outside of building zones. For more efficiency and success, the political institutions should specify explicit goals for development inside and outside of building zones, and develop new instruments for guiding development outside of building zones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Accurate identification of urban land use is essential for many applications. However, as physical surfaces of land-cover types are not necessarily related to their use and economic function, differentiating among thematically detailed urban land uses (single-family residential, multi-family residential, commercial, industrial, etc.) using remotely sensed imagery is a challenging task, particularly over large areas. Few thematically detailed urban land-use mapping products have successfully been created via automated means at regional scales, and no such product currently exists for the entire United States. This study demonstrates an approach that uses US census block groups (BGs) as the basic unit of geography and predicts the percentages of 10 urban land uses for each BG. Predictors are based on a number of national-scale and publicly available data sources, including census data, point locations of land-use features, and historical land cover. Results indicate the importance of accounting for contextual/proximity effects when identifying land uses. The method, demonstrated over a four-county area surrounding the city of Boston, provides a potential model for broad-scale urban land-use mapping.

AB  - Under the United States federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, states must implement transportation system management (TSM) tactics in urban areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of using TSM tactics to improve air quality. Based on this assessment, the authors conclude that TSM measures should be effective in eliminating localized carbon monoxide problems, but that such measures are not likely to contribute significantly toward reducing regional oxidant levels. In addition, because most individual TSM tactics can have only marginal impacts on regional motor vehicle emissions, coordinating the planning and implemen- tation of a portfolio of TSM measures will be an essential element of an effective TSM program for improving air quality.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP &quot;land cover classification system&quot;. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - Green Belt policies have helped to create chaotic landscapes at the rural-urban interfaces of the United Kingdom's largest cities. Their prime functions, to control urban sprawl and preserve an encircling green girdle to separate the urban from the open countryside, have created 'edgelands' that have been remarkably dynamic despite relatively strong controls on certain types of development. A detailed case study of one part of London's Metropolitan Green Belt, drawing upon analysis of planning registers, reveals long-term trends in land-use change linked to the development controls operated within the context of the Green Belt and the adjacent built-up area. This paper also outlines the history of the Green Belt policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and discusses recently proposed policy changes that have provoked ongoing debate about this form of control on urban sprawl and its consequences for the land use of Green Belts and the edgelands. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The concepts of transport mode energy consumption and road network capacity are explained in the paper, which are applied to forecast the minimum energy consumption in a Meg polis. A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

AB  - As concern grows regarding urban sprawl and forest and agricultural land preservation, the effectiveness of land-use policies in shaping land-use change warrants further study. We evaluate the impact of county-level zoning laws, the most predominant land use policy in the USA, and land rents on the relative amounts of forest, agricultural, and developed land, while controlling for demographic information and taxation rates. Over the past decades, southern Indiana has experienced forest regrowth on private lands, but this regrowth has declined in recent years with increased conversion of open space for urban residential development. We develop a model of land-use shares in 40 southern Indiana counties based on the net benefits to agriculture, forestland, and urban uses using a maximum likelihood estimation of a Dirichlet distribution. We find agricultural land rent and indicators of land productivity are the most important predictors of the proportion of agriculture and urban uses. Forest use is better explained by shifting regional economic structure and hilly terrain. Counties with a greater proportion of their work force in the service sectors have a greater proportion of land forested. Finally, to some extent zoning may protect agricultural land in the region, although land rents, land characteristics, and population are strong predictors of the ratio of agriculture to urban use. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

Network costs and origin-destination requirements are modeled endogenously and consistently. Indirect and induced losses associated with direct impacts on transportation and industrial capacity are distributed across zones and ecomonic sectors.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - During the last decades Mediterranean systems are being affected by important land use changes which are transforming the entire landscape. Traditional irrigated lands have constituted one of the most characteristic agro-landscapes in the Mediterranean and have played a relevant socio-economic, ecological and environmental role. However, these valuable agro-landscapes are progressively decaying due to recent socio-economic changes which, at the same time, are promoting new irrigated lands outside the river valleys. These new irrigated lands have a major effect on land, water resources, landscape and the biodiversity value of extensive tracts of the Mediterranean area. At the same time, Mediterranean drylands are quickly disappearing due to land abandonment. In addition, Mediterranean areas are suffering a quick urbanisation process affecting both natural and agricultural areas. These trends may be considered as a reduction of the most characteristically rural Mediterranean landscape to favour ecologically extreme landscapes: on one side the natural areas and on the other side the new irrigated lands and urban areas. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the factors driving the land use changes in the Mediterranean, to analyse their ecological effects and to explore the potential implications of several policies regarding land use and natural resources. To this aim, we have analysed the land use changes and their socio-economic and environmental context in three study cases in Southeastern Spain, an arid Mediterranean area where the four above-mentioned land use changes are taking place. These study cases are the traditional irrigated land of Murcia, the agricultural system of Mazarron-Aguilas and the land use changes in the Mar Menor watershed. The ancient Murcia irrigated lands constitutes a paradigmatic example of the loss of this valuable agro-landscape and its highly fertile soils due to the urbanisation process and spread of infrastructures. The Mazarron-Aguilas new irrigated lands may be considered as representative of the most intensive agricultural systems in the Mediterranean area, which are quickly spreading at the expense of drylands and natural areas. The Mar Menor watershed have suffered important agricultural and urban-tourist land use changes affecting the hydrological and nutrient dynamics and the biological communities of the coastal lagoon and associated wetlands. An integrated approach has been applied combining GIS, Remote Sensing, spatial and environmental modelling and dynamic system models to analyse the sustainability of these three case studies, the spatial and temporal patterns of land use, the main socio-economic and environmental driving factors and their ecological implications.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

Growth management consists of public policy initiatives by city officials to lessen the adverse impacts of urban sprawl. This article examines local growth management in terms of the mechanisms of policy implementation tools. The emerging body of research and theory on instruments of public policy implementation gives a new perspective on the effectiveness of urban growth management efforts. The author tests policy tools theory by adapting Peter’s three-way matching analytical approach, which includes policy tool, management strategy, and policy community, using urban growth management as the policy area for analysis.

AB  - A framework is presented for evaluating the accessibility of urban networks to the transportation needs in urban areas. Accessibility has been defined from the point of view of the network configuration and its relationship to key factors influencing travel demand. The definition is a departure from the traditional methods of accessibility, which primarily describe the interaction of people and places. The definition in this study helps in assessing the interaction between the trip maker and the transportation network, thus helping in an evaluation of the utility of the network to trips in a study region. The methodology uses the computational capabilities of a geographic information system and relates them to the traditional urban transportation planning process. Specific indexes are presented to quantify the accessibility of the network with respect to key factors influencing trip production and attraction. The methodology presented is applicable to the analysis of accessibility of other transportation system networks and to comparisons of the accessibilities of networks of different urban areas.

AB  - The different approaches that other countries take to land use reflect many national variables, including planning systems, institutional structures, socio-cultural characteristics, population pressures and environmental priorities. Literature reviews of relevant land-use issues in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden provided the background material for this paper. Other European countries appear to offer models of more pro-active and indicative land-use planning, in contrast to the adversarial system in the UK, and a much stronger regional focus. This seems to have made it easier to implement other policies, for example on renewable energy. Experience with liberalisation of agricultural markets, and the promotion of environmentally sustainable farming are both relevant to an increasingly polarised agricultural sector in the UK. Cutting across all these themes is a reflection on governance of land use. Of the countries considered, Sweden's focus on environmental sustainability, international responsibility and long-term consistency of direction appears to be most closely aligned to the coming land-use challenges. When drawing conclusions from this review it is important to bear in mind the effect of differences in bio-geographic factors, socio-economic conditions and political culture, both in other countries and within the UK. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management.

These include direct impacts on land used for transportation facilities, and indirect impacts caused by changes to land use development patterns. In particular, certain transportation planning decisions tend to increase sprawl (dispersed, urban-fringe, automobile-dependent development), while others support smart growth (more compact, infill, multi-modal development). These development patterns have various economic, social and environmental impacts. This paper describes specific methods for evaluating these impacts in transport planning.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Based on the theories of the information entropy of urban land use structure, co-integration and error correction model, this thesis analyses the relationship between economic growth, urbanization level and the information entropy of urban land use structure. The information entropy values of China's urban land use structure from 1981 to 2004 have been calculated in this paper. The relationship between China's GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is investigated in details. The results indicate a co-integration relationship between GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure. However, there is no co-integration relationship between urbanization and the information entropy of urban land use structure. On the basis of the above analyses, the error correction model on GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is instituted. The application of the model shows that every 1% decrease in the information entropy value of urban land use structure demands a 59.53% growth in GDP. Because of the existing co-integration relationship between the economic growth and the information entropy of urban land use structure, the order degree of China's urban land use structure has relied heavily on the economic growth for a long time. The economic growth will significantly affect the optimal regulation of urban land use structure in the future. Further investigation also shows that economic growth and urbanization act as the direct driving force of the optimization of urban land use structure, but the optimization of urban land use structure can't promote the economic growth and the urbanization. Therefore, it becomes a very pressing strategic issue to adjust the economic structure and industrial distribution to optimize the distribution of urban land use and to optimize the structure of urban land use to improve the efficiency and promote the socio-economic development.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aim of the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP "land cover classification system". The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - The present study investigates the relationship between the use of land and selected spatial determinants of change in a Mediterranean urban region (Attica, Greece). A multi-temporal analysis was developed to assess the influence of population density, sealing intensity, distances from roads and from the main urban centre, land protection regime, municipality surface area, elevation, climate aridity, soil characteristics and sensitivity of land to degradation on changes in the spatial distribution of nine land-use classes derived from LANDSAT imagery for 1987 and 2007. Artificial, bare and burnt land increased in the last 20 years with the consequent decline in land-use quality and landscape diversification. Rain-fed crop and sparsely vegetated areas experienced the highest probability to edification. Elevation, population density, the distance from the centre of Athens and from the main roads were the variables affecting the most rapid changes in the use of land. Multivariate analysis allows identifying the most relevant spatial determinants of land-use changes as a target for environmental policies against land consumption in expanding urban regions.\nThe present study investigates the relationship between the use of land and selected spatial determinants of change in a Mediterranean urban region (Attica, Greece).

AB  - This research is driven by the critical need for a technological breakthrough in taxi-out prediction, and intelligence-based decision making capabilities for an airport operating system. With the advent of sophisticated automation, the use of information-driven intelligent decision support system (IIDSS) to control service operations such as airport has become a necessity to ensure efficiency and throughput. However, airlines, airports, and air traffic controller (ATC), still lack the use of intelligent systems that can assist them in delay prediction, schedule adjustments, and optimal decision making in the face of uncertainties. As per U.S. Govt. Joint Program Development Offices roadmap, new technology is needed to accurately predict delays and efficiently utilize the existing capacity to support the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). Hence, new research is needed to accurately predict taxi-out times which in turn can assist in making schedule adjustments to reduce congestions and delays, and provide a means for better utilization of ground staff of the airlines. We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation scheme for predicting taxi-out times that was tested on data from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport (DTW). Initial results show that the average prediction error for >80% of the flights are <3 min.

AB  - This article addresses issues of urban land development in Indonesia, including urban land use; ownership and transfers; land taxation; and land information systems. Until very recently, urban land-use planning in Indonesia was largely top-down in character and neglected to include the public as a stakeholder. This article argues that the role of government in urban land-use development needs to change at all levels and that the capacity of local government in land-use management needs to be strengthened. The presence of private developers in urban development should be encouraged. Land development permits—as a means of urban development control—while they may still be necessary should be granted primarily in relation to urban land-use plans (RUTR). Land taxation instruments have not been effectively applied to control land utilisation in the cities. Data and information on land affairs are lacking.

AB  - Land use and transportation are linked by complex, yet identifiable, relationships. Tools are needed to formalize this relationship and to take it into account when decisions are made about urban and suburban transportation systems. This paper reviews foundational concepts of performance measures of metropolitan transportation systems. It offers a rationale for the types of tools needed to measure and assess land use and transportation system efficiency. One tool being developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation-the Transportation-Efficient Land Use Mapping Index (TELUMI)-illustrates how research findings can be applied in metropolitan transportation planning. TELUMI uses cartographic modeling (CM) techniques and parcel-level geographic information system data. The fine resolution of the data measures microscaled land use conditions associated with travel patterns in built-up areas. CM generates maps of zones in a region that match land use conditions with travel behaviors. Zones are defined by land use variables, such as density of activities, presence and agglomeration of destinations, block size, and transportation infrastructure attributes. CM also performs advanced quantitative analyses of map attributes, and it is effective with lay and professional audiences. TELUMI's use of individual land use variables makes it possible to target intervention strategies, such as augmenting density or building sidewalks, and to evaluate their effectiveness in improving transportation efficiency. TELUMI assists transportation and local planning authorities in allocating transportation investments appropriate to multimodal travel.

AB  - This paper examines the extent to which the teaching and research mission of the U.S. academy addresses concerns about the connections between the built environment and health. Recognizing that the base of theory and scientific evidence is still underdeveloped, nonetheless the aggregative work is sufficiently plausible that prudence requires that we move ahead with creating new interdisciplinary programs to address these important connections. We recommend applying the “best principles” derived through experience, even as we strive to further detail and rigorously test apt conceptual models through focused research and evaluated interventions to extend the base of science. Best principles as distinct from the more customary term “best practices” are used to underscore the need to extract the core issues from the context in which they are taught. This is especially true at an early stage of program development. We are confronting situations in which institutional settings vary greatly, even as the ostensible pedagogic and research activities are the same. Best principles are invoked to remind us that as we proceed to create new programs, institutional settings will be critically different, even though the resultant interdisciplinary programs that we are seeking will have underlying and readily adaptable common principles.

AB  - Several innovative transportation concepts were critical components of the early twentieth-century City Beautiful reconfiguration of built environments: orderly public places, suitable for important civic buildings; clear hierarchies of streets, avenues, and boulevards, organized in rational patterns with orchestrated vistas; and new terminals that housed improved intercity rail facilities and enhanced intracity travel through improved multimodal surface transportation connections. The City Beautiful aesthetic approach to conceiving urban circulation networks was an important and often overlooked contribution to transportation planning, and improving urban transportation was an important goal for City Beautiful reformers. A review of historical planning documents and project descriptions suggests that civic leaders' approaches to improving urban circulation during the City Beautiful era are enduring contributions of the movement's integrated approach to land use and transportation planning and its desire to transform cities into more beautiful places.

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - A package of large-scale investments in the transportation infrastructure in the Stockholm metropolitan region is currently being proposed. It contains new investments in the railway and subway systems as well as new links in the road system. This paper deals with the issue of appraising this kind of investment program. One major problem is the lack of a unique standard method, and it is argued that several tools should be used in a practical evaluation of large-scale investments in the transportation system. Four different approaches are presented and related to each other. First, one study uses a network-based mode-split/assignment model with a fixed trip matrix. The second study is complementary, as its aim is to also trace the impacts on the spatial distribution of population and jobs by applying an integrated transportation and land use model. Third, the long-run effects of the investments on regional economic growth are discussed within the framework of regional production functions. Fourth, an alternative approach is used, in which benefits from the investments are assessed through their estimated influence on aggregate land values.

No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.  Further, when measures are computed under four benevolent scenarios that each generate the support of some stakeholders (reduced transit costs, reduced congestion, increased local autonomy, and increased compact development) some performance  measures indicate improvement and others do not.

AB  - The paper analyses the changing pattern of land uses in rural settlements located in the rural-urban fringe and makes a link between the results to socio-economic developments and to changes in the rural policy at the national level. Using historical sequences of land use maps and using geostatistical analysis, we observe changing land use patterns in three Moshav type settlements - the most common type of rural settlement in Israel - in three different rural-urban fringes belts along the coastal area. We identify basic trends of specialisation and intensification of agricultural land use as well as expansion of built up structures for residential and commercial purposes. These trends which are rather similar for all three cases, we argue, reflect economic and social changes in rural settlements in general and in the rural-urban fringe in particular. The evolving patterns in the three Moshavim in the Israeli rural-urban fringe (RUF) can be understood as adjustment measures at the household level to development and changing policies at the macro level, particularly towards the rural sector. There are two major domains of change. First, a transition from dependence on farming to a more diversified economic base suggesting newly shaped interrelationships with the urban space. Second, a new residential development program which has rejuvenated failing and ageing rural settlements. The outcome is a major process of restructuring which affects the economic, social and environmental spheres, and necessitates sensitivity on the part of institutional decision makers towards the complex and diverse realities of relevant actors on the ground, through which all current and future land use policies are mediated. Moreover, being exposed to uncontrolled and often chaotic adjustment measures over the last three decades, it might be necessary to regulate and preserve some of the Moshav's distinct features so it does not to fade into an 'ordinary suburb'. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

AB  - A magnetic-levitation (maglev) transportation system including levitation and propulsion control is a subject of considerable scientific interest because of highly nonlinear and unstable behaviors. In this paper, the dynamic model of a maglev transportation system including levitated electromagnets and a propulsive linear induction motor (LIM) based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics is developed first. Then, a model-based sliding-mode control (SMC) strategy is introduced. In order to alleviate chattering phenomena caused by the inappropriate selection of uncertainty bound, a simple bound estimation algorithm is embedded in the SMC strategy to form an adaptive sliding-mode control (ASMC) scheme. However, this estimation algorithm is always a positive value so that tracking errors introduced by any uncertainty will cause the estimated bound increase even to infinity with time. Therefore, it further designs an adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control (AFNNC) scheme by imitating the SMC strategy for the maglev transportation system. In the model-free AFNNC, online learning algorithms are designed to cope with the problem of chattering phenomena caused by the sign action in SMC design, and to ensure the stability of the controlled system without the requirement of auxiliary compensated controllers despite the existence of uncertainties. The outputs of the AFNNC scheme can be directly supplied to the electromagnets and LIM without complicated control transformations for relaxing strict constrains in conventional model-based control methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes for the maglev transportation system is verified by numerical simulations, and the superiority of the AFNNC scheme is indicated in comparison with the SMC and ASMC strategies.

AB  - As an open source and modular software system using highly disaggregated data for dynamic simulation, UrbanSim has been instrumental in making integrated land-use transportation modeling accessible beyond the bespoke models that characterized earlier generations. The UrbanSim model and the collaborative OPUS framework (Open Platform for Urban Simulation) that it has spawned have stimulated much original progress in this field. The object of this thematic issue of the Journal of Transport and Land Use is to report on this work and to illustrate the various ways UrbanSim has been adapted. However, this special issue is more than just a collection of progress reports. A central theme running through all the papers is that integrated land use-transportation modeling in Europe presents a series of challenges and demands not necessarily present in the United States context in which UrbanSim was developed. Thus, while the UrbanSim system can be technically adapted to European studies given the data and resources, the prevailing land-use transportation environment in Europe differs from the United States.

However, we must recognize the problems that restrict ridership to a hardy few. For the rider, these include danger from autos, stop and go driving on streets not designed and maintained for skinny tires, and bad weather. And for the local government, bike lanes take up valuable space without providing revenue. Presented here is a concept of an elevated, enclosed bicycle transportation system that would enable the electric bicycle to become an acceptable form of transportation for the general public, and put a major dent in pollution and dependence on foreign oil.

It is shown that the effects of tariffs, urban wage subsidies and urban production subsidies in the short run, in which capital is immobile, do not carry over to the long run with capital mobility.  Policies for promoting urban growth reduce the urban unemployment ratio in the short run, but, by contrast, raise the urban unemployment ratio in the long run.  Along with agglomeration economies and inter-sectoral externality, the urban unemployment ratio plays a key role in determining social welfare.  Three traditional policy options of a small open economy are discussed.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - The mobility challenges of the developing world are considerably different than those in wealthier, advanced countries, and so are the challenges of coordinating transportation and land use. Rapid population growth, poverty and income disparities, overcrowded urban cores, poorly designed road networks, spatial mismatches between housing and jobs, deteriorating environmental conditions, and economic losses from extreme traffic by congestion are among the more vexing challenges faced by developing cities that could be assuaged through improved coordination of transportation and urban development. This is underscored by examples reviewed in this paper from South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, India, Africa, and South America. It is concluded that whatever is done to improve transportation and land-use integration must be pro-poor. The cardinal features of integrated and sustainable transport and urbanism everywhere---accessible urban activities and safe, attractive walking and cycling environs---are particularly vital to the welfare and prosperity of urbanites in the world's poorest countries.

AB  - The last two decades have witnessed the implementation of various policies based on land-use to address problems stemming from automobile ownership and use. There are, however, questions with respect to the efficacy of such policies. This paper therefore reviews the literature on empirical studies of the transportation-land-use interaction with the objective of identifying the current state of knowledge concerning the interactions, particularly with respect to the impact land-use policies are likely to have on the system. The focus is on studies conducted in North America. The results are mixed; some studies conclude that urban densities, traditional neighborhood design schemes, and land-use mix have an impact on auto ownership and use. Other studies find the impact of such variables to be at best marginal. Gaps in our understanding of the interaction are identified. These are found to be primarily the result of data limitations and methodological weaknesses. A detailed discussion of the implications of the findings for the development and application of integrated transportation-land-use models is provided, with the recommendation that without such an integrated approach to analyzing the transportation-land-use interaction, any study of impacts of urban form on travel behavior is likely to yield erroneous results.

AB  - Accelerated population growth in general and an increasing expanse and intensity of metropolitan development through- out the world have focused attention on urban transportation and growth management. The high cost of urban highways and mass transit systems, coupled with the necessity of guiding private use of land toward acceptable levels of rational development, have resulted in various urban investment strategies. Among these, the concept of joint development of transportation facilities and high activity nodes has emerged as a promising solution to problems of overcrowding and congestion in major cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Such integrated public and private investment not only tends to maximize the cost effectiveness of required facilities, but offers opportunities benefit of the public at large and as an incentive for risk capital investment. A comprehensive study was undertaken by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning of Texas A&M University to examine the requisites of effective joint development in selected metropolitan areas, including Toronto and Montreal, Canada; Washington, DC, San Francisco and Atlanta in the USA; and Paris, France. In all instances, it was found that fixed guideway rapid transit had a discernible, positive impact on urban growth and intra-urban transportation, opportunities provided versely, it was confirmed that effective application of this strategy required the pre-existence of economic viability in general, and in the specific transportation for imaginative growth management and was, indeed, a major inducement for private investment.

This study was undertaken to explore the potential for land economics research that draws on parcel level spatial data for urban land markets, and uses differences across a sample of cities as the source of variation. Policy obstacles such as protected open spaces and other land use regulations, like the limitations caused by land forms such as water bodies and mountains, can be expected to alter the supply of land in ways that will be reflected in land market outcomes across cities. Based on a sample of data for 46 California cities, this exploratory analysis analyzed land market outcomes as a function of population, income and other factors in a closed-economy model, including a ratio that measures the concentration of developed lands within a city's radius or perimeter. The approach produced robust relationships consistent with other studies, and results consistent with expectations not just in terms of the signs of the estimated coefficients but in terms of their magnitudes as well. Indeed, the elasticity of land development with respect to population has been estimated to be 0.79-0.82 based on open city models. The evidence suggests that both land forms and land use regulations have a positive effect on land prices; however, it was not possible with the current data to distinguish the amenity effects of proximity to oceans and mountains from the supply constraints on radial city expansion. The analysis, nevertheless, provides encouraging evidence for future research of this kind. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - If we are to accommodate the rate of urban growth which North America will face in the first half of the twenty-first century, it is the contention of this paper that we must build new cities, not new towns, beyond commuting distance of existing cities. These can be located in open countryside on virgin land, or they can grow around existing small towns, all in conjunction with the construction of an innovative personal transportation system. In this paper a hexagonal modular structure, in which self-contained urban units can be combined and added to over time, is proposed as a new urban form and AVCS maglev - which will serve the new cities efficiently - is proposed as a key transportation strategy.

AB  - se regulatory system has been criticized for causing or failing to solve social problems and for perceived inherent defects, such as inefficiency, inequality, and environmental harm. These criticisms fail to understand the land use regulatory system in the United States as a dynamic, functional, adaptive system. This paper systematically analyzes the: 1) functions; 2) location and scale; 3) components; 4) processes; and 5) values of the land use regulatory system in the United States. If we are to improve our land use practices to be fairer, more efficient, and more ecologically responsible, we must understand how land use planning and regulation function and change over time. Particular attention is given to the role of land use regulation as a mediator between people and places, between communities and power, and between freedom and boundaries. Additional attention is given to the broad array of forces shaping land use decisions, the "thinness" of land use law as a set of rules and limits (contrasted with its role as a source of tools, authority, and discretion), and the "patchiness" of land use regulatory authority in the United States. This paper also examines a specific issue of law and policy: the extent to which the land use regulatory system can value and conserve ecosystem services - the humanly beneficial services that nature provides. The paper explores both barriers to and opportunities for accounting for ecosystem services in land use planning and regulation.

AB  - The challenge of facilitating economic density is fundamental for successful urbanization. Flexible and forward-looking institutions that help the efficient functioning of land markets are vital in this respect. In particular, institutional arrangements for regulating land use, managing public land and allocating land rights have significant implications for how cities deliver agglomeration economies and improve the welfare of their residents. This book provides fresh insights into these issues, compiling selected pieces of analytical and empirical research presented at the World Bank's Fourth Urban Research Symposium on Urban Land Use and Land Markets, held in Washington, DC, May 2007. Specially commissioned papers helped develop a robust analytical foundation to clarify ongoing debates on urban land management and welfare and synthesized the political and administrative challenges of improving the efficiency of urban land markets. Among the questions that this book addresses are: - Does more public intervention in land markets produce more affordable land market outcomes? - Do conventional approaches to strengthening property rights bolster security of tenure and market transactions? - How should governments go about integrating informal settlements with the broader city economy? © World Bank 2009.

AB  - Cities play a vital role in promoting economic growth and prosperity. The develop- ment of cities largely depends upon their physical, social, and institutional infrastruc- ture. In this context, the importance of intraurban transportation is paramount. This article provides an overview of urban transport issues in India. Rather than covering every aspect of urban transportation, it primarily focuses on those areas that are important from a policy point of view. The article first reviews the trends of vehicular growth and availability of transport infrastructure in Indian cities. This is followed by a discussion on the nature and magnitude of urban transport problems such as congestion, pollution, and road accidents. Building on this background, the article proposes policy measures to improve urban transportation in India. Indian cities cannot afford to cater only to private cars and two-wheelers and there has to be a general recognition that policy should be designed in such a way that it reduces the need to travel by personalized modes and boosts public transport sys- tem. This requires both an increase in quantity as well as quality of public transport and effective use of demand as well as supply-side management measures. At the same time, people should be encouraged to walk and cycle and government should support investments that make cycling and walking safer.

Set up in its modern form in 1947, the system has remained substantially unchanged in spite of a radically altered policy environment. This paper considers the nature of the system and notes both its robustness and its flexibility as well as the accusations of delay and uncertainty that are levelled at it. It considers the drivers for change which are likely to affect the system, and in particular the challenge of climate change, the rights of third parties, the question of major infrastructure projects, and the desire for neighbourhood protection. The paper concludes by asserting that there is a need to refocus the debate on the quality of outcomes rather than on the process. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This paper examines the land use policies implemented in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, from 1965 to the present. Curitiba used land use planning, the hierarchy of the road network, an economic development policy and public transport to coordinate the parameters for the location and density of homes, work, recreation, services and commerce. The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working. Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management. The paper describes the integration of land use/transportation policies and the instruments that contributed to its enforcement and attempts to draw selected lessons from the experience.

AB  - This paper formulates a random-growth urban model with a notion of geographical fitness. Using techniques of complex-network theory, we study our system as a type of preferential-attachment model with fitness, and we analyze its macro behavior to clarify the properties of the city-size distributions it predicts. First, restricting the geographical fitness to take positive values and using a continuum approach, we show that the city-size distributions predicted by our model asymptotically approach Pareto distributions with coefficients greater than unity. Then, allowing the geographical fitness to take negative values, we perform local coefficient analysis to show that the predicted city-size distributions can deviate from Pareto distributions, as is often observed in actual city-size distributions. As a result, the model we propose can generate a generic class of city-size distributions, including but not limited to Pareto distributions. For applications to city-population projections, our simple model requires randomness only when new cities are created, not during their subsequent growth. This property leads to smooth trajectories of city population growth, in contrast to other models using Gibrat's law. In addition, a discrete form of our dynamical equations can be used to estimate past city populations based on present-day data; this fact allows quantitative assessment of the performance of our model. Further study is needed to determine appropriate formulas for the geographical fitness. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban land use is not an unfamiliar topic today. Because of the rapid urbanization process and urban expansion, land use has become a practical issue with increasing concern. The growing concern on sustainable development has led to a new challenge what is sustainable urban land use and how to make urban land use sustainable. At present, a comprehensive review of the theme can hardly be found for the research scope is so broad and the existing literature is dispersed in this field. To fill the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the research works so far on sustainable urban land use from two perspectives: theoretical development and technological applications. Specifically, detailed review is given from six aspects: urban development patterns, urban land use planning, urban land carrying capacity, urban land-use simulation models, urban land-use sustainability assessment and urban land-use planning support systems. Based on the review, a comparison between the development of theories and technologies for the sustainability of urban land use is given and the future direction of the research on sustainable urban land use is provided.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The common confusion of land cover and land use in many data sets is problematic for many data integration activities. This article proposes an approach for the separation of land cover and land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case, they provide building blocks that allow land cover and land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land cover) and function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land cover and locations where the concepts of use and cover are confused. The separation of land cover and land use facilitates the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland.

AB  - Urban transportation system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops and influenced by transportation, social, economical, and environmental factors. Conventional transportation modeling approaches are unsuitable to simulate and evaluate its performance. This paper presents a system dynamics approach based on the cause-and-effect analysis and feedback loop structures. The proposed SD model comprises 7 submodels: population, economic development, number of vehicles, environmental influence, travel demand, transport supply, and traffic congestion. The model runs in Vensim PLE software using the data from Dalian, China. The coefficient of the intervention policy of vehicle ownership is chosen as the control variable for simulation, and the impacts of different policy scenarios on urban development and transportation system are analyzed. It suggests that Dalian should restrict the total number of vehicles to improve the sustainability of transportation system.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - Low-speed transportation systems have great potential in megacities such as in Shanghai, China, as they could reduce travel demand for motorized traffic and produce significantly less carbon emissions as compared with other transportation modes. Low-speed transportation systems have significant advantages over other motorized transportation systems, such as low carbon emissions, low energy consumptions, low noise, and less roadway damages. To encourage the use of low-speed transportation systems, strategies and technologies should be developed with the considerations of safety and operational performance improvements to low-speed transportation system users. This paper aims to discussing technology considerations for developing safe and efficient low-speed transportation systems. The key technology approaches that could be used to enhance low-speed transportation system performances include: (1) behavior analysis of vulnerable users, (2) analysis of operational and safety characteristics of vulnerable users, (3) planning methods for low-speed transportation systems, (4) safety design of low-speed transportation infrastructures, (5) model development for safety evaluation of low-speed transportation systems, and (6) safety improvement program for low-speed transportation systems. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineering.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

AB  - A meta-analysis of the Land System Science literature identified that small-scale land uses currently receive little attention in studies seeking to understand land use change dynamics. We conceptualised two ways in which small-scale land uses operate to indirectly drive more extensive land use change: (1) through modifying spatial landscape attributes and (2) through altering underlying forces driving the expansion of other land uses. We then propose the concept of ?intensive land uses?, those that occupy a small proportion of the landscape but indirectly drive land use change dynamics through their operation. Our discussion highlights that, with the exception of roads, we currently underestimate the importance of intensive land uses in the literature and we illustrate this with a case study of a commonly disregarded intensive land use: mining. We conclude that the inclusion or exclusion of land uses from analyses should extend beyond quantifying their land use area and instead incorporate an understanding of how land uses operate within their regional context. Finally, we present three future research opportunities to incorporate intensive land uses into analyses and models of land use change dynamics.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

AB  - Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.

The use of paleopalynological techniques to determine forest changes in the time span of the past century to recent millennia requires thoughtful selection of the sampling site but can reveal unrecorded species losses and introductions as well as regional forest changes related to urbanization. Pre-forest clearance witness tree records provide the basis for comparison to ascertain how the modern old growth urban forest differs from the forest primeval. Historical floras from the period immediately following the forest resetting event are catalogs of arboreal ­species present at the time of old growth urban forest formation that can be used to determine subsequent species diversity changes. Forest remeasurement studies are limited because methodological uniformitarianism and actualism are difficult to achieve due to insufficient detail in recording prior field procedures. However, ­comparisons of past data and resampling results provide invaluable information on changes in the canopy, subcanopy, and sapling layers that is essential to understanding­ forest dynamics and historical continuity.

There are, however, questions with respect to the ecacy of such policies. This paper therefore reviews the literature on empirical studies of the transportation ±land-use interaction with the objective of identifying the current state of knowledge concerning the interactions, particularly with respect to the impact land-use policies are likely to have on the system. The focus is on studies conducted in North America. The results are mixed; some studies conclude that urban densities, traditional neighborhood design schemes, and land-use mix have an impact on auto ownership and use. Other studies ®nd the impact of such variables to be at best marginal. Gaps in our understanding of the interaction are identi®ed. These are found to be primarily the result of data limitations and methodological weaknesses. A detailed discussion of the implications of the ®ndings for the development and application of integrated transportation±land-use models is provided, with the recommendation that without such an integrated approach to analyzing the transportation±land-use interaction, any study of impacts of urban form on travel behavior is likely to yield erroneous results.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - This paper describes several major research opportunities in the area of transportation "supply" over the next 3-5 years. The general focus of all these topics is on service design. These research topics are classified into three principal categories: capacity provision, vehicle scheduling and vehicle control. In the category of capacity provision, the major research topics are airside airport capacity, freight-terminal location and vehicle-fleet sizing. Vehicle scheduling topics include route and schedule design, empty-vehicle redistribution and routing of hazardous materials. The topics discussed in the category of vehicle control are highway safety, air-traffic control and traffic-management systems. Associated with these various topical areas are five important methodological themes: (a) vehicle utilization; (b) development of stochastic models; (c) decentralized control of complex systems; (d) data collection, processing and presentation; (e) supply-demand interactions. © 1985.

AB  - To address climate change, many U.S. states are taking action to establish policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all economic sectors. With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided. The information in this paper provides a starting-point for transportation practitioners to use when initiating their own evaluations of greenhouse gas mitigation options at the regional, state, or local level.

The implementation of operational evolution plan will follow the same general operational concept, including positive control of aircraft at high altitude by air traffic controllers to ensure aircraft separation. Changes to the air transportation system must consider multiple dimensions such as technology, operating procedures, human factors, policy and economics. It is concluded that fundamental changes will also require establishing operational concepts, which may correspondingly require a core communiation, navigation and surveillance, operating procedures and automation for air traffic control and management.

AB  - A thorough examination of the causes of land-use change is necessary to effectively deal with the magnitude of changes across the globe. Chihuahua, Mexico is experiencing rapid land-use changes due to processes of globalization. The emergence of Mexico's maquiladora program is an indicator of economic globalization that has had far-reaching social and environmental consequences. This article examines population and income patterns from 1970 to 2000 as part of a hierarchical system and tests whether or not processes of globalization can be detected in the patterns. Findings indicate that population and income concentrate primarily in Juarez, while simultaneously deconcentrating in most other municipios of the State. Moreover, these patterns correlate with patterns of maquiladora concentration. Additional findings identify proximity to the US and established urban centers as drivers of population concentration. These findings support the notion that patterns and processes of globalization are important drivers of population and income concentration at the local level in Chihuahua, Mexico. Finally, the findings support the conceptualization of population land-use and income concentration as part of a hierarchical system. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - InVeTraS (intelligent vehicular transportation system) is proposed as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) anti-collision mechanism that determines, estimates and absolves collision courses between two or more vehicles based on a correlative and cooperative wireless networking concept. The problem of collision avoidance is abstracted to the generic problem of location awareness and subsequent periodic information exchange (between vehicles). To enable location awareness, the mechanism uses one of two techniques: a global positioning system (GPS) receiver aided with dead-reckoning sensors or a RADAR based measurement system. Two nearby vehicles periodically exchange information about their own movement in terms of exact position and local clock time. Using these inputs, vehicles determine whether or not they are on a collision course with each another. A communication cluster (based on the concept of mobile ad-hoc peer-to-peer networking) is formed, that facilitates the development of a vehicular network characterized by self-organization, fault-tolerance, scalability, cooperation and cost efficiency. These characteristics enable avoidance of collision between vehicles in an adaptive and dynamic set up. The paper simulates the proposed InVeTraS concept over a torus topology emulating the streets of Manhattan.

The infrastructure of the application scenario is wireless sensor networks with mobile sinks. The WSN is query-based and with multi-hop transmission for data sensing. The application-specific network architecture was introduced and exploited. The detailed routing algorithm as well as its initialization phase were developed. Analysis was given on the end-to-end delivery latency, aiming to optimize the routing in both real-time ability and energy efficiency. Compared with the existing routing mechanism for the same application scenario, the proposed algorithm demonstrates less delivery latency and consequently lower energy consumption. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the routing mechanism as well as to compare it with existing method numerically.

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role. This chapter describes two case studies that apply the genetic algorithm approach.

AB  - In Virginia, off-network, or local network, VMT calculations are performed based on counts taken as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) program. A regional average VMT is calculated based on counts taken at a number of region-wide locations, This VMT average is then applied to overall local road lengths to calculate the local network VMT. This calculation method has been approved by the EPA for use in Air Quality Conformity analysis. The off-network VMT calculated with this method was found to be 22 percent of total VMT for the Hampton Roads non-conforming region. Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis tools were used to identify issues that would cause an inflated off-network calculation. Analysis included determining whether the data derived from these count sites represented regional average travel. The methods employed included an identification of regional land use averages, a determination of whether network roads were double counted, and analysis of whether count site locations were representative of average, local road characteristics, The issues identified by this analysis resulted in a recalculation of off-network VMT using a smaller portion of the previously used HPMS count data which more accurately represented regional averages. This recalculation resulted in a 45 percent reduction in the off-network VMT,value used for air conformity. The paper outlines some of the drawbacks of using HPMS data to derive off-network VMT values and identifies a number of issues that may be inflating these values in other areas of the country.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

AB  - North American cities have undergone dramatic changes over the last century. Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005–2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption.

AB  - This report treats the requirements of planning methods for short-range and low-capital transportation options within the context of two primary objectives. The objectives are (1) the presentation of a fundamental set of behavioral principles which are relevant to the planning process and (2) the discussion of alternative methods for assessing the behavioral consequences of transportation changes. The presentation of fundamental behavioral principles relies substantially on classical behavioral reinforce- ment theory, but reference is also made to attitude theory, econometrics, marketing, and psychometrics. The discussion of data collection procedures presents information on sample specification, and it illustrates a variety of questionnaire formats for the collection of perceptions and preferences from respondents. Advantages and disadvantages of the formats are mentioned. Based on the discussion of behavioral principles and methods, general guidelines are offered for the modeling and data collection requirements of planning methods for short-range and low-capital transportation options.

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

First, through an experiment in urban form, the paper quantifies the potential impacts of land-use policy on air pollution. Second, via an experiment in air pollution spillover effects, it investigates economic costs of air pollution dispersed into a community from outside. Together, these two experiments indicate both the potential benefits and limitations of controlling air pollution through land-use policy actions.

AB  - Exposure to air pollution has become an exceedingly inescapable part of urban living. The presence of pollutants in urban air is reported to cause adverse effects on human health, as as damage to structures and materials. Their presence can also be an aesthetic nuisance around urban centres. Modelling of urban air pollution is an important facet of pollution control and abatement. Models explain the occurrence, Intensity, and movement of pollutants. Current techniques used for modelling urban air pollution use dispersion characteristics to predict pollutant levels at locations away from defined sources. They work well in relatively simple situations with few sources in consideration. However, these models cannot handle the mathematics in an airshed with many point and non-point sources of urban air pollutants, This is because many simplifying assumptions have to be made, which limit the accuracy of predictions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling is a technique that offers many advantages in modelling non-linear type processes Such as those that govern complex urban air pollution situations. This technique uses historical data sets and can recognize the patterns that occur between different pollutants the urban airshed. ANN modelling is a "black-box" method, where equations describing the complex situations are not known or required. The model simply extrapolates patterns, and "learns" based on historical data, much the same,way: the human mind learns. Therefore, ANN may be suitable for air pollution modelling of situations where the governing equations are too complex or expensive to derive. This paper describes the use of ANN to predict behavior of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within a defined region of the City of Edmonton, Alberta.

Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - For the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia land use maps were generated for four time slices between 1975 and 2005 using LANDSAT satellite data. The determination of built-up areas was the main focus, since this study aims at raising public awareness on the problems related to urban sprawl and growing human induced consumption of land. Within this context a method was developed for cost- & time-efficient change detection in land cover classes based on prior classification results and newly acquired imagery. To cover an entire state with about 34000 km² and various time steps operational tools are required that enable the derivation of consistent land use and imperviousness maps. ISODATA clustering and knowledge-based decision trees were used to separate change and no-change pixels be- tween a classification from 2001 and newly acquired imagery in 2005. The method was suc- cessfully tested on small subsets and subsequently applied to entire North Rhine-Westphalia. Independent accuracy assessment with 85.6 % proofed the quality of the approach. For the urban areas additional improvements and homogenization of all four classifications could be achieved by integrating results from regression analysis between NDVI and the degree of imperviousness. For the country, the derived products form an unprecedented base for visu- alization and quantification as well as for various applications as e.g. land use cover change modeling, hydrological applications or any other study with a regional coverage

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Perhaps the most apparent transportation planning and urban development\nproblems that have over the years received attention of, and yet\ncontinue to pose challenges to policy makers, are the need to provide\nsustainable public transport system and revitalisation of distorted\nsocio-economic policies. The pressure created by rapid population growth\nof Lagos on transport infrastructure and services in the city is indeed\ngreat that decline in quality and quantity of services are inevitable\nand uncertain. The persistent trials and errors in the urban public\ntransportation policy resulted to the introduction of the three wheeler\nvehicular mode of public transportation in the metropolis of about 11\nmillion people.\nSince the vehicles hit the streets of Lagos about two years ago, many\nunder-employed graduates were put in business, many un-educated citizens\nincapacitated by poverty-stricken background got something to do, while\nshort-distanced commuters, who hitherto had made their trip on foot or\nmotorcycle had relief. These gains were, however, over shadowed by the\nrelatively small size of the vehicle (officially three passengers full\ncapacity) that made it uncomfortable for many passengers, its fragile\nnature inability to withstand the restlessness and aggressive nature of\nLagos commuters, emissions from within and other vehicles, engine noise\nfrom within and other vehicles continuously give passengers persistent\ndiscomfort. More importantly, the adoption of the mode for public\ntransport with its attendant limited occupancy restraint design put many\npassengers at risk and made the mode unsafe at any speed.\nThis paper examines the policy background of the introduction of this\nmode of public transportation in the most populated city in the African\ncontinent and discusses in details the transport-related pollution\nimplications of its use on the environment and the urban passengers and\npopulation. The overall concern of the government driven and dominant\ncontrol of public transportation systems in rapidly growing Nigerian\ncities is highlighted and the some policy suggestion advanced towards\nensuring a more effectively sustained public transport systems and urban\nenvironment.

Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - It has been recently shown that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean network flow, density and speed exists in the urban transportation networks under some conditions. An MFD is further well defined if the network is homogeneous with links of similar properties. This collective behavior concept can also be utilized to introduce simple control strategies to improve mobility in homogeneous city centers without the need for details in individual links. However many real urban transportation networks are heterogeneous with different levels of congestion. In order to study the existence of MFD and the feasibility of simple control strategies to improve network performance in heterogeneously congested networks, this paper focuses on the clustering of transportation networks based on the spatial features of congestion during a specific time period. Insights are provided on how to extend this framework in the dynamic case. The objectives of partitioning are to obtain (i) small variance of link densities within a cluster which increases the network flow for the same average density and (ii) spatial compactness of each cluster which makes feasible the application of perimeter control strategies. Therefore, a partitioning mechanism which consists of three consecutive algorithms, is designed to minimize the variance of link densities while maintaining the spatial compactness of the clusters. Firstly, an over segmenting of the network is provided by a sophisticated algorithm (Normalized Cut). Secondly, a merging algorithm is developed based on initial segmenting and a rough partitioning of the network is obtained. Finally, a boundary adjustment algorithm is designed to further improve the quality of partitioning by decreasing the variance of link densities while keeping the spatial compactness of the clusters. In addition, both density variance and shape smoothness metrics are introduced to identify the desired number of clusters and evaluate the partitioning results. These results show that both the objectives of small variance and spatial compactness can be achieved with this partitioning mechanism. A simulation in a real urban transportation network further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in effectiveness and robustness compared with other clustering algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional. The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research projects.

AB  - Many states in the USA attempt to manage urban growth so that development is directed to urban areas equipped to accommodate development, and rural lands are preserved for resource and other non-urban uses. The state of Oregon is entering its third decade of what many commentators describe as the nation's most aggressive urban growth management programme administered statewide. This article reports a recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the state urban growth management policies as they are implemented by the metropolitan Portland area. The metropolitan Portland area contains the largest population, employment and land base within a single urban growth boundary in the USA. Using primary data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the urban growth management and resource land preservation effort is assessed. Nearly all regional development has been directed to the urban growth boundary and away from resource lands. Many problems with administration are found, however. Policy implications are suggested.

AB  - Recent trends towards the intensification of urban development to increase urban densities and avoid sprawl should be accompanied by research into the potential for related health impacts from environmental exposure. The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of the built environment and land use on levels of environmental noise. Two different study areas were selected using a combination of small area census geography, land use information, air photography, and ground-truthing. The first study area represented residential land use and consisted of two- to three-story single-family homes. The second study area was characteristic of mixed-use urban planning with apartment buildings as well as commercial and institutional development. Study areas were subdivided into six grids, and a location was randomly selected within each grid for noise monitoring. Each location was sampled four times over a 24-h day, resulting in a total of 24 samples for each of the two areas. Results showed significant variability in noise within study areas and significantly higher levels of environmental noise in the mixed-use area. Both study areas exceeded recommended noise limits when evaluated against World Health Organization guidelines and yielded average noise events values in the moderate to serious annoyance range with the potential to obscure normal conversation and cause sleep disturbance.

AB  - A large number of techniques for conserving energy in urban passenger transport are described. A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - Land-use/land-cover information constitutes an important component in the calibration of many urban growth models. Typically, the model building involves a process of historic calibration based on time series of land-use maps. Medium-resolution satellite imagery is an interesting source for obtaining data on land-use change, yet inferring information on the use of urbanised spaces from these images is a challenging task that is subject to different types of uncertainty. Quantifying and reducing the uncertainties in land-use mapping and land-use change model parameter assessment are therefore crucial to improve the reliability of urban growth models relying on these data. In this paper, a remote sensing-based land-use mapping approach is adopted, consisting of two stages: (i) estimating impervious surface cover at subpixel level through linear regression unmixing and (ii) inferring urban land use from urban form using metrics describing the spatial structure of the built-up area, together with address data. The focus lies on quantifying the uncertainty involved in this approach. Both stages of the land-use mapping process are subjected to Monte Carlo simulation to assess their relative contribution to and their combined impact on the uncertainty in the derived land-use maps. The robustness to uncertainty of the land-use mapping strategy is addressed by comparing the most likely land-use maps obtained from the simulation with the original land-use map, obtained without taking uncertainty into account. The approach was applied on the Brussels-Capital Region and the central part of the Flanders region (Belgium), covering the city of Antwerp, using a time series of SPOT data for 1996, 2005 and 2012. Although the most likely land-use map obtained from the simulation is very similar to the original land-use map - indicating absence of bias in the mapping process - it is shown that the errors related to the impervious surface sub-pixel fraction estimation have a strong impact on the land-use map's uncertainty. Hence, uncertainties observed in the derived land-use maps should be taken into account when using these maps as an input for modelling of urban growth. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model is applied to the rail/road transportation system in the Iberian Peninsula. Five planning scenarios are considered. It is shown that modal shares are very sensitive to the cost of rail and to that of track gauge changes at the Spanish border. Conversely, the location of the terminals has little or no impact on the market shares of the combined traffic, but location changes in the Peninsula generate consequences on the entire European transportation system. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research investigates whether the process of transfers of urban land use rights in China, particularly where the state plays a major role in the transfer of urban land, complies with basic principles of good governance. In order to assess market, an assessment framework is developed. A critical analysis of secondary data from official and non-official sources is done. Major changes since late 1980s in the institutional environment and subsequent results have been assessed. The findings reveal that the transfer of urban land use rights in China is gradually responding to an improved governance system. Institutional reforms have led to a steady improvement in indicators such as transparency, efficiency, and access to information. Nonetheless, the market has significant weaknesses in addressing equity issues, engaging stakeholders, tackling corruption and dealing with expropriations. In general, the paper finds that the efficiency and effectiveness of the urban land market largely depends not on the type of tenure regime per s??, but rather on the system of governance in place. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Each of the stakeholders in the transportation system-local, state, and federal governments; the fuel and motor-vehicle industries; and public- transportation providers, users, and others-will have roles to play in moving toward sustainability. The motor-vehicle industry, as manufacturers of the vehicles that are used for 99 percent of the personal ground veh-km of travel, will need to participate proactively with all of the stakeholders in the transportation system as it addresses the challenges and opportunities in the areas of fuel consumption, emissions, congestion, safety, and access.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) Insurance, or mileage-based insurance, has the potential to be an effective transportation pricing strategy with multiple benefits including reductions in vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, and vehicle emissions. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), in partnership with Progressive County Mutual Insurance Company (Progressive), conducted a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of implementing mileage-based insurance and whether such a program would impact driver behavior. During the first phase of the study, a statistical analysis of available data produced a positive correlation between mileage driven and accident frequency, thus validating the hypothesis that insurance companies can provide financial incentives to customers who drive fewer miles because of an associated reduction in claims costs. A second phase of the pilot program offered financial incentives to volunteer participants who were able to reduce their mileage from a personal baseline condition. Data collected from the participants' vehicle on-board diagnostic system resulted in an average mileage reduction of five percent. Additional spatial analysis concluded that mileage reduction was independent of participant residence suggesting PAYD Insurance would be a viable strategy to minimize negative environmental impacts region-wide. © ASCE.

AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly. Longer term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production - offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping - along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

The system was initially designed as a robotic wheelchair for elderly and disabled people. Hence the naming MAid (Mobility Aid for Elderly and Disabled People). One of MAid’s core functions is deliberative autonmous locomotion in rapidly changing, large-scale environments, such as shop- ping malls or concourses of airports or railway stations, where tens or hundreds of people and objects are moving around. MAid’s performance was tested in the central station of Ulm, Germany, during rush-hour, and in the exhibition halls of the Hannover Messe ’98, the biggest in- dustrial fair worldwide. Meanwhile, MAid has survived more than 48 hours of testing in those environments. MAid navigation and control system is currently being extended such that it could be used as a people taxi in airports, for example.

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

AB  - Vehicles load passengers at a single service point and, after traversing some route, return for another trip. The travel times of successive trips are independent identically distributed random variables with a known distribution function. After a vehicle returns to the service point, one has the option of holding it, or dispatching it immediately. Passengers arrive at a uniform rate and the objective is to minimize the average wait per passenger. The problem of determining the optimal strategy (dispatch or hold) for a system of m vehicles is formulated as a dynamic programming problem. It is analyzed in detail for m = 1 and m = 2. For m = 1, the optimal strategy will hold a vehicle if it returns within less than about half the mean trip time. For m = 2, and for a small coefficient of variation of trip time C( T), the optimal strategy will control the vehicles so as to retain nearly equally spaced dispatch times, within a range of time proportional to C4/3(T).

AB  - This paper aims to critically reflect on establishing the new frameworks for land markets and urban land development processes in countries in transition. Based on the doctrine of the so-called 'property rights' school, land and property ownership has long been identified as a prerequisite for economic development. The common advice to countries in transition creating new frameworks for land markets was to assign and register property rights. The aim of this paper is to discuss the significance of the delineation of property rights, which for urban land development processes and outcomes falls mainly within the remit of land use regulations. In this paper the concept of property rights regime and its characteristics is developed in order to discuss the delineation of property rights and their relationship with urban land development process and its outcome. Process of land development is conceptualized depending on land ownership (private or public), and the role of the owner in the planning process. The outcome is discussed based on the morphological results and the provision of urban infrastructure. On the basis of empirical experience from transition period in Poland it is argued that the emphasis on private property rights in the absence of the institutional foundations of urban land market under capitalism was bound to produce urban problems. First, the new institutional foundation for urban land market was introduced subsequent to dynamic of emerging real estate market, and viable markets existed despite unsolved question of restitution of property rights. Second, the subsequent delineation of property rights is clearly linked to processes of urban land development, which follow the line of development without planning. It can also be related to the morphological results of urban development like the haphazard location of investments and lack of adequate approach to deal with the provision of urban infrastructure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - China's urbanization has resulted in significant changes in both agricultural land and agricultural land use. However, there is limited understanding about the relationship between the two primary changes occurring to China's agricultural land - the urban expansion on agricultural land and agricultural land use intensity. The goal of this paper is to understand this relationship in China using panel econometric methods. Our results show that urban expansion is associated with a decline in agricultural land use intensity. The area of cultivated land per capita, a measurement about land scarcity, is negatively correlated with agricultural land use intensity. We also find that GDP in the industrial sector negatively affects agricultural land use intensity. GDP per capita and agricultural investments both positively contribute to the intensification of agricultural land use. Our results, together with the links between urbanization, agricultural land, and agricultural production imply that agricultural land expansion is highly likely with continued urban expansion and that pressures on the country's natural land resources will remain high in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An analysis of data of the past few decades from cities around the world indicates that history is repeating itself. Although there are significant differences in socioeconomic and technological characteristics among these cities, a remarkable similarity exists in trends in urban transportation. The current growth in the use of automobiles in many cities of developing countries follows similar trends experienced in the United States and other developed countries several decades earlier. Even though there is much awareness and knowledge about sustainability, private vehicle ownership, and use continue to grow at an increasing pace with rising personal incomes and desires to experience faster and more reliable transportation technology. Urban density, expressed in number of people and/or jobs per unit of land, is the key indicator of the level of automobile ownership and use, and of associated parameters of sustainability. As personal incomes rise, choice of residential and job location increases, causing a decrease in urban density and affecting the relative use of private transportation and public transit. There are policy options related to land use, pricing, and technological factors that can have far reaching influence on the long-term sustainability of urban-transportation systems around the world. The basic implication of the analysis is that urban-transportation sustainability can be greatly enhanced if there are profound changes in urban structures and activities that can slow or reverse the growth in the use of private automobiles and can make transit and other modes attractive and viable.

AB  - Land use and land cover are important determinants of the state of the natural environment. As a result, measures of land use and land cover change have been widely used as indicators of environmental condition and quality. This review explores the range of measures that have been applied in the UK at national, regional and local scales, and their sensitivity to particular drivers of change. The extent to which these indicators are important properties in themselves or are surrogates for wider environmental qualities is considered. The discussion focuses on the evolving frameworks used to analyse the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment. The limitations and strengths of the DPSIR reporting and analytical framework are explored. Recent approaches to the assessment of the impacts of future land use change on the natural environment using model-based scenario methods are examined, and the need to develop new types of aggregate measure of land use function is identified. There is also a pressing need to link assessments of trends to the analysis of sustainability thresholds or limits. It is concluded that the concept of a socio-ecological system offers a more fruitful approach to the analysis of the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment than the simplistic cause-effect models that have been used in the past. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - North American cities have been evolving from monocentric to polycentric metropolitan regions, with multiple concentrations of activities occurring outside of traditional urban cores. This new urban structure, with multiple urban "activity centers," has profound influence on the functioning of cities, particularly transportation systems. This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incorporates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed methodology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria. The impact of these "transportation activity centers" on Philadelphia's travel patterns is explored.

The strengths and limitations of present static control technology and current computer traffic signal and freeway surveillance and control systems in urban areas are described. A taxonomy of possible information and control configurations in urban traffic operations is developed. The alternatives in the taxonomy are analysed and used as the basis for recommending specific real time information and control functions for improving, in an evolutionary manner, the performance of urban ground transportation systems. The recommended improvements would allow for the first time a meaningful substitution of operational control for physical (static) capacity increases in urban transportation.

AB  - The majority of comparisons between state transportation systems do not control for characteristics that may vary greatly between states (e.g., vehicle miles traveled). A shortcoming of such analyses is that a state's individual characteristics can be highly influential in determining how transportation policy is set and funds are spent. The purpose of this paper is to extend previous efforts to create groups of similar peer states by developing a new methodological framework that incorporates demographic, temporal, and locational variability into the peer group delineations. We collected historical data for 42 variables on transportation infrastructure, population, economy, growth, topography and weather. To examine trends before and after the passage of ISTEA we gathered data over two time periods: 1985 through 1990 and 1995 through 2000. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we reduced variables into seven components, and then statistically clustered states into peer groups for each time period based on the components and the remaining variables. We identified a range of cluster solutions and demonstrate how cluster statistics help to describe the contextual basis behind the peer grouping. The results of this study are to provide government agencies, researchers and the public with a systematic methodological framework for identifying peer states that reflect similar attributes contributing to the development and maintenance of state transportation systems.

AB  - Cargo shipments are subject to hijack, theft, or tampering. Furthermore, cargo shipments are at risk of being used to transport contraband, potentially resulting in fines to shippers. The Transportation Security Sensor Network (TSSN), which is based on open software systems and service-oriented architecture principles, has been developed to mitigate these risks. Using commercial off-the-shelf hardware, the TSSN can detect and report events that are relevant to appropriate decision makers. However, field testing is required to validate the system architecture and to determine if the system can provide timely event notification. Field experiments were conducted to assess the TSSN's suitability to monitor rail-borne cargo. Log files were collected from these experiments and were postprocessed. We present the TSSN architecture and results of field experiments, including the time taken to report events using the TSSN and the interaction between various components of the TSSN. These results show that the TSSN architecture can be used to monitor rail-borne cargo.

AB  - In the past few years, urban growth has affected vast agricultural areas, especially in some European regions (EEA, 2006). In peri-urban areas, land consumption is particularly intense, exposing agriculture to the risk of land loss. Assuming the action of different factors, both exogenous and endogenous, on the agricultural system, the potential risk of land use conversion is measured by the Sensitivity Index of Agricultural Land (SIAL), an innovative tool for territorial analysis. In the following paper, the SIAL will be presented with an application for a metropolitan area. In this case study, the exogenous variables of urban proximity seem to be those most involved in the processes of conversion from agricultural to urban land use. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities grow—their shape and size—will have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growth—that is, transportation routes, land use, and topography—were directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study site—St Louis, Missouri—to predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naïve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naïve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the models’ performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth.

AB  - Technologies for integrating, communicating, analyzing, and displaying spatial information interactively have been evolving in recent years. Although dissemination and analysis of information over the Internet are efficient and time effective in reaching a multitude of users, it is still difficult to perform these operations with transportation data in a graphical format using the Internet. The development of a prototype system for this purpose is described in this paper. The system specifications include the need for versatility in utilizing several forms of data such as spreadsheets, AutoCAD drawings, as well as coverage produced from various geographic information system (GIS) programs (e.g., ARC/INFO). These specifications were designed to ensure maximum utilization of existing data and to facilitate data sharing within and among various organizations. The prototype system is demonstrated using a case study of projects from the Clark County Department of Public Works in Nevada. The system was developed using an off-the-shelf suite of software programs (MapGuide). Using this software greatly reduced startup costs, time, and configuration management tasks and did not compromise the desired functionality. Through its web site, the system facilitates communications between elected officials, public works agency staff, management, stakeholders, and constituents using the Internet or intranets. Various applications were designed and developed to support project management, resource allocation, and internal or external communications as well as information storage, retrieval, analysis, and display and office automation. Because of the promise shown by the prototype system, a variety of transportation and public-sector agencies have expressed an interest in its full-scale deployment to address their emergent needs.

AB  - A systems engineering methodology was used to study the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) concept as a feasible mode of transportation. The proposed approach employs a multistep intercity transportation planning process executed inside a Systems Dynamics model. Doing so permits a better understanding of SATS impacts to society over time. The approach is viewed as an extension to traditional intercity transport models through the introduction of explicit demand-supply causal links of the proposed SATS over the complete life cycle of the program. The modeling framework discussed is currently being used by the Virginia SATS Alliance to quantify possible impacts of the SATS program for NASA's Langley Research Center. There is discussion of some of the modeling efforts carried out so far and of some of the transportation modeling challenges facing the SATS program ahead.

AB  - The connection between transportation and land use lies at the center of efforts in the United States to combat sprawl through smart growth strategies. Proponents of smart growth commonly make several specific propositions about the relationships between transportation and land use: (1) building more highways will contribute to more sprawl, (2) building more highways will lead to more driving, (3) investing in light rail transit systems will increase densities, and (4) adopting new urbanism design strategies will reduce automobile use. This article explores how well the available evidence supports these four propositions and provides an overview of the theory, research efforts, and current debates associated with each of these propositions. This overview shows that the four propositions have not yet been fully resolved: researchers have made more progress on some of these propositions than others, but even in the best cases, our ability to predict the impact of smart growth policies remains limited.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the factors responsible for residential and industrial/commercial land development in Lagos between 1984 and 2000. Land use changes were mapped using satellite images, while binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing urban development as a function of spatially explicit independent variables. Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land area.s. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

The foundation of the algorithm is that an actual road network has its particular spatial distribution features, and GIS has strong visual editing functions for transportation network. According to the size of the transportation network, with the GIS platform SuperMap, we partition the network into a certain amount of rectangular blocks, and then according to the starting node and the destination node, the searching area of the algorithm is restricted reasonably. With the actual example given, the experimental results prove the high operational efficiency and strong practicality of the new algorithm.

AB  - The establishment of an efficient transportation system is key to any human development on Earth or in space. Different technologies for transporting humans and goods have been developed, the diversity of which indicates that individual concepts have specific strengths and weaknesses. So far, transportation on the Moon has utilized a wheel‐based vehicle, the lunar rover. Present concepts for transporting goods and people in a lunar base of the future are generally based on using wheels and traction. While such systems have many advantages for a variety of applications, the hauling of heavy goods will require the preparation of stable and trafficable roadways, a challenging and potentially expensive undertaking. This paper presents an alternative based on using one of the fundamental means to move objects, namely ropes and cables. Because of their inherent characteristics, ropes have been used to lift and haul heavy loads for long distances with high levels of reliability. This mature and constantly perfected technology, not well known in this car‐oriented society, has been investigated for its use as a true alternative to the traditional wheel‐based transportation systems. As will be shown, innovative applications of cable‐based technologies may in effect provide many opportunities to leverage the differences between the Earth and the Moon for the purpose of creating efficient engineering products.

AB  - To effectively alleviate traffic pressure of urban arterial roads, optimizing one-way traffic organization is the key to bring microcirculation transportation network into full play. Aiming at reducing the saturation of arterial roads and microcirculation roads, the paper develops the bi-level programming model for optimizing one-way traffic organization with consideration of the maximum saturation restriction. The decision-making variable of the upper level programming is the scheme of one-way traffic organization of branch roads and the optimization targets are to minimize the average saturation of arterial roads and to minimize the excess of saturation over its maximum of arterial roads. The lower level programming is an equilibrium traffic assignment problem under the restrictions of the capacity of arterial roads and branch roads and the maximum saturation. The genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the model. The traffic conditions of arterial roads and microcirculation roads before and after optimizing of one-way traffic organization were compared by an example, which also proves the effectiveness of one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network. The proposed model provides an optimization method for one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network.

AB  - Although there are hundreds of airports that support commercial air passenger traffic in the United States (US), not all areas are equivalently served by the commercial air transportation system. Locations in the US differ with respect to their level of access to the commercial air network and their overall accessibility within the system. Given the complexity of the domestic commercial air passenger network and supporting infrastructure, past research has only been able to provide a limited assessment of locational accessibility within the United States. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a new metric that incorporates measures of access to air transport as well as accessibility within air transportation networks. Using a comprehensive dataset on scheduled airline service, the developed approach is then applied to the US domestic commercial passenger air transportation network to explore geographic differentials in accessibility. Results suggest marked differences between core-based statistical areas throughout the US. ?? 2010.

AB  - UNCTAD reported in 2005 that 14 of the world's top 20 container terminals are now in Asia. China ranked the fourth in 2005 with its 6.77% contribution of merchant fleet to the world trade volume. China now competes in economic size with the world largest U.S. markets whereas Korea ranks around 10th place. Northeast Asia composed of the two countries surrounding the Yellow Sea and Japan consists one of the largest economic blocks along with EU and NAFTA. In addition to this economical aspect, the Yellow Sea is geo-physically a shallow basin with average depth of 44 meters. These economical and geographical characteristics of the Yellow Sea region enable and necessitate the development of an efficient inter-modal transportation system or a Short Sea Shipping (SSS) system among Northeast Asian economies. Short Sea Shipping(SSS) System is one of the most efficient transport systems to solve the problems arising from the road transport, such as road congestion, traffic accidents and air pollutions and higher social cost than sea transportation. Experience of EU since the beginning of '90s indicates that the adoption of SSS system apparently improves the total transport costs as well as the indirect social costs caused by the road traffics. SSS system is a part of a transport chain for the intermodal door-to-door supply system and most of its potential is highly depends on the real-time information and EDI technology which enables the scheduling and linking of different transport modes. Advanced cargo handling technologies can also improve the flexibility of port connections. Ship borne cargo handling facilities will bring economies of scale to deprived small ports that would otherwise be excluded in the major transport chains. The importance of SSS system connecting Korean and Chinese ports across the Yellow Sea, and necessity of its development and establishment is too apparent to mention any specific reasons. In this presentation, the practical aspects of SSS system bridging economies of Northeast Asia will be reviewed from variable aspects ranging from ship design, terminal equipments and even to port design and management for the purpose of revitalizing the regional economics.

AB  - Urban growth has been replaced by stagnation and shrinkage processes at many places in Europe during the last decades. Demographic changes and out-migration because of lack of jobs belong to the main impact factors. Urban planners are chal- lenged by this new and dramatic development that impacts on housing markets, the utilization of infrastructure, local labor markets and the whole viability of urban structures. Urban Research is requested to elaborate new concepts and strategies for cities loosing population, facing a big amount of vacant building stock and a large-area re-use of brown-fields. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the chances and limits of urban modeling to explain and assess urban shrinkage proc- esses in their quantitative and qualitative dimension. First, expertise of new shrinkage processes is investigated in order to explain the need for urban modeling concepts. Second, it is discussed to what extend often misrepresented ‘fuzzy’ social sci- ence knowledge about urban shrinkage can be brought methodically together with ‘sizable’-data-based urban models. Third, variables and a prototype model structure are presented to approach to an urban shrinkage model. Finally, novel scientific questions and recommendations for further cooperation of social science and urban modeling are presented.

AB  - Rather than a bad case of urban sprawl, the physical expansion of China's megacities may be viewed as a combination of 'urban spill over' and 'local urban sprawl'. This paper reviews land use regulations in their institutional context and argues that conflicts in land use regulation are related to ideologies of land ownership and embedded in different planning doctrines. These hypotheses are investigated with special reference to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. The evidence suggests that entangled land use regulations for "urban" and "rural" land have imposed serious constraints on urban growth, while the contradictions of different policies and regulations in the use of rural lands for urban construction have led to intensive and unhealthy competition among stakeholders. As a result, not only have the costs of land conversion from rural to urban uses increased, but the spatial development of Guangzhou has been distorted. The implications of these failures for future policy are discussed with emphasis on the reform of the land use regulation system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Implementation of NextGen operational concepts and procedures within the air trans- portation system will require the definition of appropriate measures of performance, as well as a deep understanding of the systems limitations and margins for improvement. In this paper, we derive an analogy between the operation of the air transportation system and that of a supply chain by leveraging the similarities between the air transportation system and the beer distribution system, and conducting a thorough examination and comparison of the measures of performance and constraints in both systems. Based on the proposed analogy, as well as previous research conducted in the field of supply chain modeling, we de- fine an equivalent supply chain framework and define appropriate measures of performance for the air transportation system. Finally, we model a network of airports and ARTCCs to help illustrate the implementation of particular supply chain management methods and lean manufacturing strategies, and help identify margins for improvement in the operation of the air transportation system. This model is further used to study the consequences of the implementation of 4-D trajectory-based operations.

Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  -  China railway has been playing an important role in the economical development and has been confronted with the requirement of higher speed, higher capacity of transport, higher degree of safety and higher quality of services. With the development of artificial intelligence, communication, computer, and its related technologies, it becomes feasible to rebuild traditional railway with such advanced technologies in order to resolve the problems mentioned above. China railway had started an informatics-based construction on train planning, dispatching, interlocking and other special fields from early 1980 successively. The conditions are ready for the transformation of railway transportation system to the railway intelligent transportation system (RITS). Establishment of system architecture is the first step to develop the China national RITS. This paper presents the current state of the research and development of information and intelligence technologies in China. On the basis of the discussion about the definitions and goals of China national RITS, the developed principle and the system architecture, which includes service architecture, logical architecture and physical architecture for China national RITS are discussed at the end.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Dean’s Words Mohinder Singh Dean LTA Academy 2 012 has continued to see sustained effort in urban transport research, planning and development all over the world. We see evidence of this in the contributions to this issue of JOURNEYS, and even during some of the presentations made at the 3rd World Cities Summit held in Singapore in July this year. A highlight of the four day biennial event was the Flagship Urban Solutions Track (FUST) series of discussions which also explored the successes and challenges of various urban transport solutions. We are pleased to feature excerpts from one of those discussions, namely, Mobile Cities – In Search of New Urban Mobility Systems, here. Also, Dr Carlos Dora and Jamie Hosking, collaborating under the auspices of the World Health Organization, present an insightful review on the various ways urban transport directly and indirectly affects our overall health. Their findings are not confined to just physical health, but also examine other areas that have an impact on our well-being, including access to employment, education and recreation. From the portals of Demographia, a public policy firm in St Louis, USA, Wendell Cox questions the long-held and popular belief that lower density cities have longer average work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion compared to more compact cities. He puts forward several key evidence, arguments and analyses to show that the opposite is true – that higher urban densities are associated with longer work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion. London’s splendid showing during the 2012 Olympics is largely underscored by a well- planned public transportation strategy that ensured everyone arrived everywhere on time, with minimal disruption to the city’s daily business routine. The strategy leveraged on a Travel Demand Management programme christened Travel Advice for Business (TAB). Chris Hanley of Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was part of the team that delivered the TAB programme and shares exactly how it was done with a detailed account in this volume. Dr Wong Yiik Diew and Koh Puay Ping at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University provide a detailed examination of cycling mores in Singapore. They trace its evolution from an initially popular transport mode which was later relegated to being ‘the poor man’s transport’ and its current re-emergence as green transportation in an energy and environment conscious age. They also present the findings of a survey that revealed the preferences and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians affected by them. The survey findings could be useful in directing and determining the future of cycling culture in Singapore. The Land Transport Authority’s Mageret Ely and AECOM’s Elaine Brick continue the discussion on the topic of cycling in the final article, but from a more global perspective. Focusing on the growing popularity and success of bike-sharing schemes in three cities, namely, Paris, New York and Copenhagen, they outline how strategic policy, network planning, education and awareness contribute to the growth of such programmes. The various authors for this volume have generously given their time and talent to help improve our understanding of so many areas in urban transportation development and planning, and helped us to have a new outlook to old issues. They have provided invaluable insight and simultaneously demonstrated how we can never assume that convention cannot be challenged and ingenious solutions are inconceivable. For that, I most surely thank them and trust you will find this volume an enjoyable read. Before signing off, I would like to give you a sneak peek at what JOURNEYS 2013 will hold. We shall be producing one bumper volume in 2013, as a commemorative issue for the upcoming inaugural LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) 2013.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although there are only a limited number of rigorous research papers focussed specifically on land use perceptions, there is an extensive literature on: environmental attitudes in general and urban growth in particular, as well as on the land use perceptions of farmers and on public perceptions about the use of land for the production of food and raw materials. A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact. So the paper concludes with a discussion about future perceptions and possible behavioural change. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay. ?? 2006.

AB  - Of the various advanced wireless communication technologies used for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), WiMAX has recently received much attention because of its potential to provide broadband network connectivity, large coverage areas, quality assurance, and mobile access. However, few studies have focused on the deployment, operational, and performance issues of using WiMAX networks for ITS applications in a real roadway environment. This study performed a field performance evaluation of a regional WiMAX network in West Virginia by using important network metrics, including uplink and downlink throughput, signal strength, and connectivity level. On the basis of performance analysis, this paper discusses the feasibility and suitability of a regional WiMAX network deployment for a wireless sensor-based traffic surveillance system in terms of frequency, power, and client side radio requirements. This study provides an insight into the feasibility of using WiMAX to address ITS applications. It will benefit transportation agencies and other stakeholders to support decision making in the deployment and operation of a WiMAX-based ITS network in the future.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A case study to assess the survivability of a large-scale urban intelligent transportation system (ITS) network is presented. The ITS for Boise, Idaho, was analyzed on the basis of two survivability assessment techniques, which are discussed and summarized. The first approach provides a qualitative assessment of the Boise ITS; it is based on the survivable systems analysis method as modified for critical infrastructure. The second approach provides a quantitative assessment of network survivability by using a multilayer graph-based approach consisting of the greater Boise area power grid and surface transportation system. The power grid and the physical and control transportation graphs were analyzed to determine the relative criticality of various network components. Macroscopic modeling was used to investigate the effect of components' failure on the network's operational characteristics. The greater Boise area has a population of more than half a million. The analysis presented here serves as a case study showing the means of assessing the importance of various components in critical infrastructure layers. The results have enabled traffic operators and decision makers in the Boise area to understand the effects of failure events and to prioritize threat mitigation alternatives.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

AB  - Warehousing plays a central role in the transportation system, especially in freight transport. Previous literature on warehousing and transportation connections has concentrated on logistics problems, inventory management, and location choice. However, warehousing also plays a role in the larger transportation system and may be an indicator of the level of efficiency in the system. In a hypothetically perfect world, with perfect transportation (free and instantaneous), there should be little, if any, need for or use of warehousing services. In the real world, the more warehousing is used relative to transportation services, it is logical to say that the less "functionally efficient" is the transportation system, particularly for freight transportation. Warehousing services cost money and they are used mainly due to the imperfect functioning of the transportation system. The further away the real world system is from this hypothetical "perfection", the greater should be the "intensivity" of warehousing, i.e., its use relative to transportation services. Accordingly, different regions, industries and sections of the transportation system may be evaluated and compared by examining warehousing intensivity. Using a set of measurements, we document that warehousing intensivity varies considerably across different parts of the United States and Europe.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - Estimating transit ridership in tourist corridors is a challenge to transportation planners. This challenge occurs often because there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of travel but little hard data on transit use by visitors. Regional travel forecasting models do not work well in these situations because they are typically used for area-wide analyses, with aggregation of socio-economic data into zones that are large and ill-suited to the specific station-area and ridership analyses that are important to transit planners. This paper provides a description of an innovative process to use parcel-level data in a geographic information system (GIS) to prepare travel forecasts for a transit project in Orlando, Florida. The established four-step transportation process was used - trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and trip assignment - to determine transit travel in the corridor. Travel attractions and productions were identified by parcel in the International Drive Resort Area (IDRA). Trips were distributed to locations external to the study area, within the study area, between station areas, and within station areas of the transit line. Adjustments were made to the forecasts based on ridership elasticity due to travel time and wait time. Sensitivity of ridership to changes in activity in the IDRA were also explored. Several alternatives were studied, with variations of routes, technologies, and numbers of stations evaluated. Satisfactory results were obtained using the transit trip forecasting method, aiding in selecting an appropriate alternative to be advanced into design.

AB  - Smart growth is an approach to urban planning that provides a framework for making community development decisions. Despite its growing use, it is not known whether smart growth can impact physical activity. This review utilizes existing built environment research on factors that have been used in smart growth planning to determine whether they are associated with physical activity or body mass. Searching the MEDLINE, Psycinfo and Web-of-Knowledge databases, 204 articles were identified for descriptive review, and 44 for a more in-depth review of studies that evaluated four or more smart growth planning principles. Five smart growth factors (diverse housing types, mixed land use, housing density, compact development patterns and levels of open space) were associated with increased levels of physical activity, primarily walking. Associations with other forms of physical activity were less common. Results varied by gender and method of environmental assessment. Body mass was largely unaffected. This review suggests that several features of the built environment associated with smart growth planning may promote important forms of physical activity. Future smart growth community planning could focus more directly on health, and future research should explore whether combinations or a critical mass of smart growth features is associated with better population health outcomes.

In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - Urban land use has been a major driving force behind land use change in Estonia since regaining independence and land reform process in the 1990s. The study summarizes land use change, land management and planning practices in the urban fringe over a period of 20 years with the aim of introducing a sustainable land use policy in highly fragmented suburban land. The processes and dynamics of land use change are explored using cartographic and landscape metrics analysis. The liberal-conservative planning practices have resulted in ad hoc allocation solutions which have created dramatic changes in land use in Estonia during the 1990s and 2000s. The patchy and scattered suburban land is formed by occupying former agricultural land, natural grasslands and forests. In the framework of physical planning, the land use, spatial and urban changes are related to master plans. The nature of the evolution of land management and the deficiencies of institutional framework are discussed as factors in inefficient land use in the sprawling suburbs. A further debate on the feasibility of encouraging land use diversity in peri-urban zones is advocated. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use is a kind of important form that affects environment, especially in big city. If land use is not appropriate, and that result will destroy ecological environment, lead to land resource wasting, and will cause socio-economic problems. So, information acquiring of urban land use is one of the key issues of city planning. That is to say, how to monitor, manage and treat information on land use are all important for our zoning commission. As we all known, the precision and efficiency of traditional methods based on spectral feature is not high. One reason is that precision of the photos is low, so high quality results is not possible to acquire; the other reason is that the methods used by us are not high efficient, so we can not acquire satisfying results. In this paper, an unacquainted and small area named WuQi County (in Shaanxi Province) is as an example. Based on surveying the areas, a lot of RS images of these areas are get together. According to the spectral and spatial properties of information on urban land-use in the town and related knowledge, some new methods and technologies are used to RS images and urban land-use extraction with the support of manual work. Idiographic process consists of several parts.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of determining optimal paths for routing an undesirable vehicle on a network embedded on an Euclidean plane. A typical application is the transporting of hazardous materials. Demand points, or population centers, are discretely distributed at nodes and continuously distributed on straight-line links of the network. The objective is to find, without incorporating the probability of accidental leakage of hazardous material, a path that minimizes the weighted sum of lengths over which this vehicle is within a threshold distance λ of population centers. By appropriately redefining link lengths, we can use a shortest-path algorithm to solve the problem. Special properties of the objective function allow us to efficiently calculate the modified link lengths. We discuss the properties of the optimal routing strategy and the objective value, and offer an economic interpretation of the case when λ varies. Operating within the framework of risk analysis, we integrate the probability of accidental release of hazardous material into our basic model. The routing objective becomes the minimization of expected damage, where accidental leakage of hazardous materials can inflict damage within a neighborhood λ of the accident site. We also discuss our computational experience in using the model.

AB  - This paper describes concepts and techniques to measure the flexibility of a transportation system to accommodate changing demands and traffic patterns. Flexibility is increasingly desired as a characteristic of transport systems, particularly in light of changes in supply chains and traffic patterns, and the concern for the vulnerability of the system to both natural disasters and terrorist actions. Two approaches are described. One is based on current methods for estimating system capacity, and the related concept of reserve capacity. This results in a conservative estimate of flexibility. The second approach permits variations in the traffic pattern, in order to more fully capture demand variations that can be accommodated. The described measures are implemented on a containerized freight rail network, as a means of testing their feasibility and potential value as descriptors of system characteristics. The uses of the measures in planning, investment, and policy-making are discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field “science of complexity” has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Today’s self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic “patterns”. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially “enslaves” its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the “higher” level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the “lower” levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

AB  - In response to the concerns about the costs of sprawl and to guide growth development of Maryland's future, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Act of 1992 and recently passed the Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Act of 1997. While the first legislation established new visions for growth and development of Maryland's future, the second legislation gives the State programmatic and fiscal tools to assist local governments implementing the Visions. The growth management legislation has very important implications for land use development and transportation system in the Baltimore region. This research simulates the land use-transportation interactions by means of an integrated land use and transportation model, and evaluates economic and environmental impacts of smart growth and alternative policies and their distributional impacts by income groups in the Baltimore metropolitan region. The mode simulates the demand and supply in both land and transportation markets and models explicitly the feedback from the transportation system to the land use system and induced demand associated with transportation improvements. Consumers' surplus is used to evaluate the result and impacts of various policy scenarios on different income groups. This paper reports the mode design and database development for this modeling effort. Recently, the Baltimore Metropolitan Council (BMC) initiated the integrated land use/transportation modeling project. This paper summarizes the progress of this project. It first reviews the forces driving integrated modeling applications and the state of art in urban and regional modeling. Then, it outlines the model design for the Baltimore region. Finally it reports the database development for model calibration and forecasting.

With its economic development, population growth, and urbanization in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China, have experienced a dramatic land use change over the past 30 years. Assessment on urban land use change is essential for policy makers to support sustainable development. In this paper, urban land use change in Chengdu using Landsat TM/ETM+images (2000-2008) based on RS and GIS is discussed. The result shows that the spatiotemporal change of urban land use was significant, the conversion between cultivated land and built-up land was intensive, more and more agriculture land was converted to non-agriculture land, therefore, urban area expands was very fast. It is also noted that decrease area of cultivated land was 12.025&amp;#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> hm<sup>2</sup>, increase area of built-up land was 6.195&amp;#x00D7;10<sup>4</sup> hm<sup>2</sup> over the past 8 years resulting in large scale urban land use.

AB  - Timely upgrading urban land use/land cover information is a prerequisite for urban planning and management. Nowadays, remotely sensed imageries, especially higher spatial resolution, imageries like IKONOS (1m for the pan data) and Quickbird (0.68 m for the pan data), have become indispensable to provide such a kind of needed information. This study is aimed to produce a land use map using IKONOS imageries obtained for a part of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province of China. The study area contains seven land use types such as vegetated strips, park, water, road, residential (old &amp; new) and industrial areas according to the urban land use classification system stipulated by the Urban Management Committee of China. In this study, a sequence of methods is developed to obtain urban land-use map and the methods-acquired results are in-situ tested. Specifically, the hierarchy tree classification method is utilized to obtain land cover map with consideration of contextual information. Spatial analytical functions are then applied to improve the accuracy of the land-use classification. The unsupervised ISODATA classification based on characteristic density map using 99&amp;times;99 moving window is employed to further improve the classification accuracy. The accuracy assessment (total accuracy: 94.54%; Kappa coefficient: 0.93) indicates that methods developed in this study can be confidently used to timely and economically provide needed information for urban planning and management.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

AB  - Policy makers concerned with the peri-urban interface find their greatest challenges in the rapid urban growth of developing mountain regions, since limitations caused by relief and altitude often lead to an increased competition between rural and urban land use at the valley floors. In this context, little attention has been paid to the affected agriculturalists' perceptions of peri-urban growth-important information required for the realization of sustainable land use planning. How is the process of rural-urban land change perceived and assessed by peri-urban smallholder communities? Which are the major difficulties to be overcome? By what means are the affected people reacting and how are these adaptation strategies linked with the ongoing landscape transformations of the hinterland?By using the example of Huancayo Metropolitano, an emerging Peruvian mountain city, it is shown that rural-urban land change is intensively discussed within peri-urban smallholder groups. Although urbanization also leads to infrastructure investments by public institutions-an advantage perceived throughout the study area-the negative impacts of rural-urban land use change prevail. The perceptions' analysis reveals that the decrease of fertile and irrigated agricultural land at the quechua valley floor is especially considered to threaten subsistence, food and income security. In order to compensate the loss of production capacities, many smallholders try to expand or intensify their land use at the suni altitudinal belt: an agro-ecological zone characterized by steep and nonirrigated slopes that can actually not be used for the year-round production of crops previously cultivated at the quechua zone. © 2013 The Author.

We find that when analyzing two dimensions of land use, generally both the Balance Index and the Dissimilarity Index should be used, and that the Dissimilarity Index should be tested at multiple scales.

AB  - Consider a city with a highly compact central business district (CBD)\nin which commuters' origins are continuously dispersed. The travel\ndemand is dependent on the total travel cost to the CBD. The transportation\nsystem is divided into two layers: major freeways and dense surface\nstreets. Whereas the major freeway network is modeled according to\nthe conventional discrete network approach, the dense surface streets\nare approximated as a continuum. Travelers to the CBD either travel\non the continuum (surface streets) and then exchange to the discrete\nnetwork (freeways) at an interchange (ramp) before moving to the\nCBD on the discrete network, or they travel directly to the CBD on\nthe continuum. Specific travel cost-flow relationships for the two\nlayers of transportation facilities are considered. A traffic equilibrium\nmodel is developed for this discrete-continuous transportation system\nin which for a particular origin no traveler can reduce his or her\nindividual travel cost to the CBD by unilaterally changing routes.\nThe problem is formulated as a simultaneous optimization program\nwith two subproblems. One subproblem is a traffic assignment problem\nfrom the interchanges to the CBD in the discrete network, and the\nother is a traffic assignment problem with multiple centers (i.e.,\nthe interchange points and the CBD) in the continuous system. A Newtonian\nalgorithm based on the sensitivity analyses of the two subproblems\nis proposed to solve the resultant simultaneous optimization program.\nA numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methodology.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - Abstract The process of urban land use change is influenced by the interactions of various stakeholders who have conflicting values and priorities. These interactions, which are characterized by a strong competition for advantageous land locations, can be represented by an agent-based model in order to better understand, analyze and forecast possible future urban land use patterns. The objective of this study is to develop and implement Agent iCity, an agent-based model that simulates the process of urban land-use change by using irregular spatial units at a cadastral scale and by incorporating the interactions of the key stakeholders. The simulation outcomes are generated for two scenarios of the process of urban land use change as it occurs under the conditions of different urban growth policies. The model is implemented on municipal cadastral and land use data for part of the City of Chilliwack, Canada, a city that has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. The results indicate that that relative household incomes and property values drive the changes in urban land use patterns as households search for affordable homes in suitable neighbourhoods. The developed Agent iCity model can assist urban planners in better understanding and analysis of the changes in urban land use patterns.

AB  - This study examines the impact of land use policy variations on urban growth in a transborder region. A primary analysis is conducted using multitemporal maps and satellite imagery for the adjacent cities of Gorizia, Italy, and Nova Gorica, Slovenia, twin towns historically trapped on a political border, a line that has changed in its degree of separation from extreme during the Cold War to minimal today. The SLEUTH land use change model is calibrated and used for forecasting land use change from 2005 to 2040. The model is run under three different scenarios, once for the whole area and twice independently for the two sides of the border, allowing a comparison of the resulting differences. The validation of the results shows that both the cities are growing independently and that territorial cohesion has no impact on change in land use pattern of the region. To plan for a sustainable future, it is invaluable to be able to successfully demonstrate policy impacts via computer modeling, simulation, and visualization and to use the forecasts within decision and planning support systems. © 2013 Copyright Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - Across the globe population structures are ageing and how older men and women interact with the transport system is increasingly important in maintaining a good quality of life and inclusion in society. The paper reviews three issues: the nature of older people's interaction with the transport system by gender; older people's attitude to travel; and the involvement of older people as road traffic casualties. Patterns of travel in the UK show that older people are heavily dependent on car use, but in the form of more frequent but shorter journeys than younger people. This is especially so for women over 70 years old who, as passengers, are very reliant on males to drive them. Attitudes suggest that there are few obstacles to public transport use, and most agree that bus travel is good, but convenience means many prefer cars. Involvement of older men and women in serious road traffic accidents show that they have lower killed and seriously injured (KSI) rates than 17-24 year old drivers. However, those aged over 70 years exhibit a trend of increasing KSI rates. Analysis of casualty rates of drivers by type of junction, manoeuvre and environmental conditions found that some gender-age groups are overrepresented in certain accident types, including higher serious accidents rates for men, and over representation of older women when driving in poor conditions and turning right and negotiating roundabouts, crossroads and T, Y and staggered junctions. Improvement in engineering design and driver training are suggested together with the need for a greater understanding of the transportation system needs of old and very old people. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The rapid growth in urbanization and motorization generally contributes to an urban transportation system that is economically, environmentally and socially unsustainable. The result has been a relentless increase in traffic congestion. Road congestion pricing has been proposed many times as an economic measure to fight congestion in urban traffic, but has not seen widespread use in practice because of Some potential impacts of road pricing remain unknown. The paper first reviews the concept of sustainable transportation system, which should meet the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice collectively. And then, based on the characteristics of sustainable transportation system, how congestion pricing can contribute to economic growth, environmental protection and social justice is examined. Examination result shows that congestion pricing is a powerful way to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation system.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the main drivers of many environmental change processes. It influences the basic resources of land use, including the soil. Its impact on soil often occurs so creepingly that land managers hardly contemplate initiating ameliorative or counterbalance measures. Poor land management has degraded vast amounts of land, reduced our ability to produce enough food, and is a major threat to rural livelihoods in many developing countries. To date, there has been no single unifying volume that addresses the multifaceted impacts of land use on soils. This book has responded to this challenge by bringing together renowned academics and policy experts to analyze the patterns, driving factors and proximate causes, and the socioeconomic impacts of soil degradation. Policy measures to prevent irreversible degradation and rehabilitate degraded soils are also identified.

AB  - One of the sources of data most utilized in Europe by planners, policy makers and researchers is CORINE Land Cover (CLC) because of its wide territorial coverage. However, the users of this spatial database do not have information on its quality for analysing urban land and its evolution. This study analyses the limitations of CLC for monitoring urban land use dynamics, using Madrid Land Use as a mapping refer- ence. This is a local geographical database with higher resolution for theMadrid region that coincides with CLC at the years of reference (2000, 2006). The results show that with respect to the total urban land area in 2000 and 2006 and the area converted to urban land between 2000 and 2006, CLC is relatively reliable. However, the confusion matrices show very high error rates, especially in dynamic analyses (changes between 2000 and 2006) and when there is differentiation between different types of land use. Researchers, planners and decision-makers should therefore exercise considerable cau- tion when using this source for analysing urban land use and its dynamics for local approaches.

AB  - Consider a city where all workplaces are concentrated in a highly compact central business district (CBD) and the commuters' homes are continuously dispersed over the residential area surrounding the CBD. The transportation facilities in the city comprise a discrete freeway network and a two-dimensional continuum of dense surface streets. The freeway network is assumed to be superimposed on the continuum and connected with it at a limited number of points (freeway ramps). During the morning peak-hours, the commuters traveling to work have a choice between two routes to the CBD: traveling along the minor access roads to enter the freeways and then proceeding along the freeway to the CBD, or using only minor street roads straight to the CBD. Given this transportation system, it is important to estimate the total trips using each freeway ramp and their spatial distribution. In this paper, an optimization model is developed to deal with this traffic assignment problem, provided that each commuter seeks to minimize his individual congested travel time. The model is formulated by intergrating the conventional network and continuum equilibrium models and its dual formation is derived. A dual-based solution method is developed using the finite element technique, and illustrated with a numerical example for a hypothetical city.

AB  - NEV travel is rapidly increasing in the City of Lincoln. What was once considered a sleepy community has opened itself up to a tremendous opportunity for Smart Growth. This pilot NEV Transportation Plan will be an example to all cities in California. With, the expected population growth, aging citizens, and future residential development, the timing is ideal. Many positive impacts will make themselves present, such as the ability for residents to easily travel to local services, medical facilities, and commercial centers as the City's NEV-planned infrastructure development is fully implemented. Neighboring cities are working together to promote a network of safe routes for NEV travel. The NEV is a viable transportation alternative. The City plans to educate residents young and old about the benefits of driving NEVs. Families can use an NEV as a second vehicle for intracity travel and short trips, and high school/college students can use them to commute. The number of older Americans is expected to double over the next twenty-five years. Hopefully in the near future, the "restricted" driver's license program for the elderly will be codified and supported by all DMV offices. Within the text of AB 2353, Chapter 7 Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Transportation Plan, it states:"It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this chapter, to encourage discussions between the Legislature, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the California Highway Patrol regarding the adoption of a new classification for licensing motorists who use neighborhood electric vehicles." In accordance with the intent stated in AB 2353, it is recommended that the State of California expand the current restricted license program and establish an. NEV driver's license program. In addition, it is recommended that an incentive program be established to encourage drivers with physical challenges to exchange their automobile driver's license for an NEV driver's license. This program should be aimed at those who no longer feel comfortable driving in high-speed traffic. One retired highway patrolmen suggested a one to two-year automatic extension incentive when exchanging licenses. The need for mobility in an aging population makes this suggestion worth pursuing. The Cities of Lincoln and Rocklin are working toward nationwide uniformity of NEV Transportation Plan design elements. The trend of transportation using electric vehicles is catching on quickly. It is a tremendously desirable mode of transportation because it is good for the environment, economical, safe and fun. Transportation planning by local governments, in cooperation with the citizens in many communities, is proliferating throughout the nation. In the future, the standardization of signs, pavement markings, vehicle codes and design standards will assist with an efficient transition and modernization of roadways and infrastructure to allow for safe NEV travel.

AB  - Road construction on major freeways is a primary cause of traffic incidents and delays. One approach to improve traffic mobility and safety in construction work zones is to use intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which can effectively enhance work zone traffic management through advanced surveillance and communication technologies. Although conceptually similar to a traditional advanced traffic management system, a work zone ITS has unique network and communication design requirements. The Palm Beach County, Florida, Interim Traffic Management System (ITMS) was a work zone ITS that was successfully deployed in the summer of 2003. Using Palm Beach County ITMS as an example, this paper provides technical guidelines for applying cutting-edge technologies, such as wireless communication, video compression, and Internet protocol encapsulation, in designing a work zone ITS.

AB  - In this paper we propose a multiclass, multicriteria network equilibrium framework for urban location and transportation decisions in the Information Age, in which the advent of telecommunication networks may provide a substitute for physical transportation. The framework interprets the option of telecommuting as a transportation mode choice and considers three distinct scenarios: (1) residential locations are known, as well as the number of residents, and one seeks to determine their places of work, along with their optimal routes of travel; (2) places of employment are given and the numbers employed are known, but one wishes to determine their residential locations and their optimal travel routes; and (3) the total number of individuals are given and one seeks to determine their residential locations, their employment locations, as well as their optimal routes of travel between. We allow each class of decisionmaker to have his or her own set of criteria associated with the route and locational decisions. We identify the underlying network structures of the problems, derive the governing equilibrium conditions, and establish the equivalent variational inequality formulations. We provide qualitative properties and propose a computational procedure along with convergence results. We then apply the algorithm to a numerical example and its variants.

Above all, sharp competition over urban land for various uses - mineral, agricultural, housing, and so forth - has aggravated land values. This has led to conflicts between individuals and between the community and some organizations. Sharp divisions among the urban dwellers of Omoku have become the norm. At the same time, the planned future land use map is virtually ignored. Bibliogr.

AB  - The Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) is an improved mode of air travel for personal transportation that makes use of the network of commercial and general aviation airports. It is a system of highly developed aircraft and ground facilities that can safely and affordably move people among several thousand of currently underused airports throughout urban, suburban, and rural America. The SATS is a combined program that consists of three main components: new vehicle technology, airspace infrastructure, and SATS service provider. The objective of this research was to study the SATS service provider component. It consisted of the definition and analysis of the demand forecast, airfield design, terminal area, and ground transportation access metrics and their interrelationships. A computer model that allowed the evaluation of different scenarios of planning and design of airfields for the SATS in Nebraska was also developed. The results of a base simulation for 2001 showed that 88 out of 91 Nebraska airports require some changes to be SATS compatible. The air traffic control and the terminal area components require the most changes. The runway length, runway surface, lighting, marking, aircraft parking, and fuel accessibility also require some minor changes and upgrades. The capacity and ground transportation access of all airports meet SATS requirements. An ongoing research effort continues to develop and calibrate the SATS metrics at regional and national levels. The results were merely preliminary work for SATS implementation in the state of Nebraska.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current trends in public transportation have led to an increased interest in smart ticketing systems. Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - Future changes in land use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be due to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about:•change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation•increased risk of flooding•change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with, a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects. © 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

As two-earner households have higher money incomes, they are expected to consume more housing. According to analysts, these households consuming larger amounts of housing are expected to find suburban locations more attractive, ceteris paribus. Two-earner households also differ from one-earner households in their preferences for particular housing characteristics such as neighborhood and density. As both members are working, the commuting costs are "doubly" incurred and access to jobs plays a larger role in their residential location decision. According to a study conducted to analyze housing market and commuting behavior, two-earner couples tend to reside more centrally than one-earner couples, and two-earner families are more suburbanized than one-earner families. The study also suggested that unmarried individuals live closer to their jobs, purchase smaller and higher quality housing units than married persons.

The supervision Module represents the temporal axis of the network by the agents of type BUS and the spatial axis by the agents STOP. These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach. Hence, through the cooperative aspects of the agent interactions, the MADSS is able to perform a coherent and preventive regulation process.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - This paper presents a systematic methodology to derive land-use classes from a remotely sensed data derived land cover map at a scale of 1:200,000. The aimof the study is to better understand the land cover/land-use relationship and to enhance the value of a land cover mapping product for the planning and management of natural resources and/or environmental change studies. In the case of the study, the land cover product is generated using the FAO/UNEP ‘‘land cover classification system’’. The methodology is heavily determined by the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery, the classification system used and the expert knowledge of the study area. For any given land cover the associated land-uses are identified as well as the land cover/land-use relationship. It is assumed that these relations can be of four types: one to one, one to many, many to one or a combination of any of the aforementioned possibilities. The land cover/land-use relation need not be consistent across the study area. The parameters used for land-use classification are based on a comprehensive review of the literature, in which land cover and land-use are usually amalgamated. A set of decision rules was established to define land-use classes. These decision rules were tested during the field survey, after which they were applied to the whole study area. The concurrence of land cover and land-use delineations is discussed for the classes identified. The result of the study is a detailed, flexible land-use data set in which the various parameters used for classification can be re-grouped according to user needs.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

AB  - With significant economic development in the last decade in China, urban land has increasingly expanded and encroached upon arable land in the last decade. Although many papers have analyzed the characteristics of urban land expansion, relatively less attention has been paid to examining the different expansion features of different-tier cities at a regional level. This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal differences of urban land expansion and arable land loss among different-tier cities of the BTH (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) region in China in the 1990s, and identifies social, economic, political and spatial factors that led to these differences. Based on urban land change data determined by interpreting Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, it was found that the urban land area in the BTH region expanded by 71% between 1990 and 2000. Different-tier cites, however, had enormous differences in urban development, such as speed of urban land expansion, speed of urban land per capita growth, and so on. These differences were closely related to rapid economic development, strict household registration systems, urban development guidelines (chengshi fazhan fangzhen), and national land use policies. Of all the new urban land, about 74% was converted from arable land, and there was a general tendency for smaller cities to have higher percentages. One of the important reasons for this result is that urban land is highly correlated with arable land in spatial distribution. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - At its June 2002 meeting in Paris and Caen, France, the members of the International Network for Urban Research and Action (INURA) collectively agreed on a declaration to express the organization's urbanist agenda. This declaration operates on two levels: one makes five statements conceived in the tradition of earlier (for example situationist) manifestos; the other is a set of concise statements on the state of the globalization process in the era of globalization and neoliberalism. Subsections of the declaration deal with an urban world, a global city, migrant cities, unsustainable urban-natural relations, neoliberalization, attacks on democracy, community vulnerability, the rise of racism, and some thoughts on possible alternatives. The strategic purpose of this declaration was to be an intervention at meetings of the international urban community, for example for the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre in January 2003 and similar regional and local events. The declaration is published here in order to invite debate among other scholars and activists on the issues raised in its theses and statements.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.

AB  - To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities, both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes, road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes, and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads due to different travel purposes, problems from using current non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes: comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km. The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research estables a three-tier NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift), NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms, benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network at the urban central area of Beijing is built up. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - The policy of smart growth in relation to urban containment has moved from the domain of policy analysts into more general acceptance, and the broad-based popular support for smart-growth policies is likely to increase as long as economic expansion continues.  Urban containment planning has the dual purpose of promoting compact, contiguous, and accessible development provided with efficient public services; and preserving open space, agricultural land, and environmentally sensitive areas that are unsuitable for development.  Containment has an effect on land prices because land prices alter when supply is changed; and if urban containment increases the value of the amenity package of a house, then this will also cause a change in house prices.  An urban containment strategy creates a new regime in urban planning and development decision making; but it also offers research challenges as a result of the difficulties in developing methodologies that can explain complex interactions and frame the results in a way that can advance public and private interests.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe the process through which climate change scenarios were downscaled in an urban land use model and the results of this experimentation. The land use models (Urban Growth Model [UGM] and the Land Cover Deltatron Model [LCDM]) utilized in the project are part of the SLEUTH program which uses a probabilistic cellular automata protocol. The land use change scenario experiments were developed for the 31-county New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) of the US Mid-Atlantic Region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 scenarios) were used to define the narrative scenario conditions of future land use change. The specific research objectives of the land use modeling work involving the SLEUTH program were threefold: (1) Define the projected conversion probabilities and the amount of rural-to-urban land use change for the NYMR as derived by the UGM and LCDM for the years 2020 and 2050, as defined by the pattern of growth for the years 1960-1990; (2) Down-scale the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as a narrative that could be translated into alternative growth projections; and, (3) Create two alternative future growth scenarios: A2 scenario which will be associated with more rapid land conversion than found in initial projections, and a B2 scenario which will be associated with a slower level of land conversion. The results of the modeling experiments successfully illustrate the spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for the years 2020 and 2050. The application of these results into the broader scale climate and health impact study is discussed, as is the general role of land use/land cover change models in climate change studies and associated environmental management strategies.

AB  - This study discusses the validity and usability of land use as an aspect of sustainable building. Buildings have an effect on land use not only because of the extraction and processing of raw materials and disposal of wastes but also because buildings occupy land during their entire service life. In addition, location of buildings has an effect on the need of networks – such as traffic networks – and their land use. Land use related indicators are typically included in the European voluntary assessment systems of sustainable buildings. ISO 21929-1 defines two land use indicators for buildings: soil sealing and land use change. However, there is neither consensus nor a harmonised method to assess this issue. As an example, land use was not included in EN 15978:2011 due to lack of agreement on a calculation method. This study outlines the environmental aspects of buildings’ land use, assesses the significance of land use that happens because of the land occupation of buildings compared to the land use because of the extraction of raw materials needed for the construction of buildings. The study has also includes information about the benchmarks of buildings in terms of land use related indicators, discusses, ands make conclusions about the compatibility of building level indicators with the urban level indicators.

AB  - The arrival of new-generation, high-spatial-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Ikonos) has opened up new opportunities for detailed mapping and analysis of urban land use. Drawing on the traditional approach used in aerial photointerpretation, this study investigates an "object-oriented" method to classify a large urban area into detailed land-use categories. Spatial metrics and texture measures are used to describe the spatial characteristics of land-cover objects within each land-use region as derived from interpreted aerial photographs. In assessing how land-use categories vary in their spatial configuration, spatial metrics were found to provide the most important information for differentiating urban land uses. A detailed land-use map with nine categories was derived for the Santa Barbara South Coast Region area. Results from our work suggest that the region-based method exploiting spatial metrics and texture measurements is a potential new avenue to extract detailed urban land-use information from high-resolution satellite imagery.

AB  - From the mid nineteenth century, the City of Dessau (Germany) developed as an economic centre. The development of new residential and industrial areas changed the natural landscape having an adverse impact on the surface water, soil water and groundwater regimes. Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - Urban sustainable mobility solutions are being discussed throughout the world to deal with problems of high use of land, congestion situations, energy consumption and emissions derived from road transportation. Part of these solutions concerns the promotion of public transportation as an alternative to individual transportation. Public transport only becomes an attractive option if, for the mobility provided (passenger x km), emits less pollutants and consume less energy. This paper focuses on comparing the fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions (CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM) between urban Diesel buses (10 litres and 2.7 litres turbocharged Diesel) and typical gasoline and diesel European light duty vehicles (1.2 litres gasoline, 1.9 litres turbocharged Diesel). Results are analyzed as a function of transported passengers. For the proposed analysis, typical low traffic and congested traffic driving cycles were selected as an input to the EcoGest model, combined with driver behaviour characteristics and vehicle characteristics. Main results are easy-to-use charts highlighting where each mode is more attractive as a function of the number of passengers inside the bus and the number of people inside the vehicle. Results were obtained using EcoGest, a numerical model developed in our research institute. This model allows simulating the energetical and environmental performance of a road vehicle in a predefined route, accounting for the driving behaviour, vehicle specifications, powertrain specifications, occupation rate and road grade. The model has been used to simulate light duty and heavy duty vehicles, including gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen cars, and diesel and natural gas buses. Predicted results have been compared with measured fuel consumption and tail-pipe emissions in real-traffic situations, standard cycles (FTP75, NEDC), and predicted results of similar models (e.g. ADVISOR). Predictions of EcoGest are, usually, very good. Copyright ASCE 2008.

In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The law calls for space utilization based on pacifism of the Japanese Constitution, making progress in national life and society of mankind, and regard for the environment, therefore the plan under development is expected to emphasize demand for actual profit to industry and national life. On the other hand, the study of the research and development for the next generation launch system is underway in Space Transportation Mission Directorate of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). In this study, two programs are the main frame. The first one is next flagship launch vehicle, which is aiming to obtain global competitiveness by achieving the cost efficiency and reliability. In the study, this is going to be realized by evolving from H-II rockets series to the technological limits. The other one is more advanced space transportation system with the new type of configuration, different from the next flagship launch vehicle with the conventional expendable rocket type. Research and development plan to realize advanced space transportation system is discussed referring to a concept of single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable launch system, and it is clear that to reduce the operation cost could break through the stagnation of the space transportation system and the technologies such as health management and should be the key to reinforce safety, reliability, and operability. To realize SSTO equipping such subsystem, mass control in the design of SSTO system is essential and system design technology to reduce the mass of structure such as tanks and frames is also one of the main subjects in the research of the advanced space transportation system. A concept of experiment vehicle system to demonstrate technologies mentioned above is studied.

The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings from a range of disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems due to the nature of the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of this, this themed edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Human transformations of ecosystems and land systems are the largest source of change on Earth. Changes in land use and management affect the states, properties, and functions of land systems. That is, intensification and diversification of land use have led to rapid changes in, e.g. biogeochemical cycles, hydrologic processes, and landscape dynamics, which in turn influence human well-being. Thus, there is a need for improved understanding of these interlinked processes and what can be done to avert negative consequences. This calls for an approach that has been termed Integrated Assessment, or the ‘‘structured process of dealing with complex issues, using knowledge from various scientific disciplines and/or stakeholders, such that integrated insights are made available to decision makers’’ (Kok, 2006).

AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the anthropogenic forcing of geomorphic systems, specifically how nineteenth century land-use changes impacted watershed hydrologic, upland erosional, and sediment delivery subsystems of Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. Identification and analysis of the timing and rate of change in these subsystems, and the reestablishment of presettlement conditions, were used to address landscape sensitivity and watershed inheritance issues in a region undergoing population expansion and development. Archival research was used to reconstruct concurrent land-use changes in the catchments of two nineteenth century water-powered mills. Changes in the physical properties of mill pond sediments including, organic content, particle size distribution, and magnetic susceptibility, were used to interpret trends in sediment source during the span of mill operation. Interpolation of augering and coring data was used to determine mill pond sediment mass and pond capacity. Hillslope hydrologic change occurred almost immediately following land conversion. Upland erosion began with the removal of A-horizon fines, and progressed with the removal of A-horizon coarse particulates, and then B-horizon particulates. Change from one source category to another was punctuated by high flow events signifying an integration of human activity and climate in the changing of system boundary conditions

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization\nproblems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters.

In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - The movement of people, goods, and information within the local metropolitan area is critically important to the functioning of cities. This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

AB  - China's economic reforms over the past decades have given rise to the development of a rudimentary urban land market. Although one cannot speak of a land "market" in the strict sense of the word, there is an urban land allocation system in which land lease rights can be acquired through the payment of a land-use fee. If the urban land market is to develop in a sustainable manner, new credible institutions need to be established that can safeguard greater legal security and transparency. For these purposes, it is necessary to establish a management system that can support the legal (tenure security), economic (leases, taxes) and broader aspects (spatial and environmental land use policies) of land administration. To make an urban land administration system socially credible and functional, land-related information should be registered and structured at a detailed spatial level, such as parcels. There is no parcel-based information system in China, but the country has developed a population registration system at a detailed spatial level that could be a starting point to develop integrated information systems, or a so-called "local spatial data infrastructure". This paper reviews China's population registration system and their spatial units and presents a proposal for an information system that can be expanded or adapted to meet the requirements of an effective land administration system. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The framework of a national land use and land cover classification system is presented for use with remote sensor data. The classification system has been developed to meet the needs of Federal and State agencies for an up-to-date overview of land use and land cover throughout the country on a basis that is uniform in categorization at the more generalized first and second levels and that will be receptive to data from satellite and aircraft remote sensors. The proposed system uses the features of existing widely used classification systems that are amenable to data derived from remote sensing sources. It is intentionally left open-ended so that Federal, regional, State, and local agencies can have flexibility in developing more detailed land use classifications at the third and fourth levels in order to meet their particular needs and at the same time remain compatible with each other and the national system. Revision of the land use classification system as presented in U.S. Geological Survey Circular 671 was undertaken in order to incorporate the results of extensive testing and review of the categorization and definitions.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - In the digital entertainment industry, cities are one of the largest artifacts modeled by artists. One alternative to modeling an entire city by hand is to use an urban simulation. Often, those simulations use a gridded terrain representation. Translating gridded simulation results into a more continuous, realistic representation useful in games and film can often be difficult. Our vectorization process transforms gridded urban land use data into a representation useful in entertainment pipelines and many GIS or online mapping tools. The process has three major phases. In the first phase, the raster data is analyzed and the transportation layer is abstracted and filtered. Next, the city blocks are constructed from the raster data. Third, the blocks are subdivided and land use and density are assigned to each constructed parcel. The results are much smoother than the gridded input, but maintain the land use patterns of that input. We output these results in a GIS format readable by a wide range of modeling tools.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

These factors include geography, history, lifestyle, politics, and economics. This paper documents the conflict between development and slow-growth interests in the San Bernardino-Redlands area of southern California. Research presented focuses on the history and viability of agriculture, the origin of and forces behind the slow-growth movement, and the economic and social impact of growth-limiting policies. The conflict between developers and slow-growth proponents in Redlands demonstrates the inability of current land-use planning to deal effectively with a number of serious problems, including urban sprawl, the protection of valuable agricultural resources, and the provision of adequate and reasonably priced housing.

This paper introduces the Sequenced Activity-Mobility Simulator (SAMS), a dynamic and integrated microsimulation forecasting system for transportation, land use and air quality, designed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional four-step travel demand forecasting systems. The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected exter- nally to be input into the forecasting process.

A survey of all urban transportation-related editorials appearing in a sample of 155 U.S. newspapers during a period of 19 months in 1973-74 revealed that a number of issues related to transit financing, transit and highway investment, bicycles, and the transportation planning process were currently under debate in the urban press. This paper presents the survey's findings regarding the incidence and viewpoint of articles on these and other issues. Transit financing concerns clearly emerged as the most frequently discussed, and some agreement in editorial viewpoint was also found. The paper concludes with the authors' subjective observations on the scope and style of editorial discussion of urban transportation issues.

AB  - A predictive continuum dynamic user-optimal (PDUO-C) model is formulated in this study to investigate the dynamic characteristics of traffic flow and the corresponding route-choice behavior of travelers within a region with a dense urban road network. The modeled region is arbitrary in shape with a single central business district (CBD) and travelers continuously distributed over the region. Within this region, the road network is represented as a continuum and travelers patronize a two-dimensional continuum transportation system to travel to the CBD. The PDUO-C model is solved by a promising solution algorithm that includes elements of the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method (FEM), and the explicit total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta (TVD-RK) time-stepping method. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the utility of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm in solving this PDUO-C problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A frequently suggested strategy for alleviating transportation energy shortage is to reduce travel demands by altering the patterns of land uses in cities. This paper examines this strategy by exploring the interface between urban structure, transportation energy consumption, and transportation policy. The interrelationships between travel demand and urban form are first examined, and research attempts to clarify and model these relationships are reviewed. The role of transportation as a land use development control is discussed, and the use of “transportation performance standards” is proposed as a method for integrating transportation energy considerations into land development controls and decisions.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - A growing number of agencies have begun to define ‘‘sustainability’’ for transportation systems and are attempting to incorporate the concept into the regional transportation planning process. Still, very few metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) capture the comprehensive impact of transportation system and land use changes on the economy, environment, and social quality of life, which are commonly considered the essential three dimensions of sustainable transportation systems. This paper demonstrates an application of the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach for evaluating selected transporta- tion and land use plans in the Atlanta region using multiple sustainability para- meters. A composite sustainability index is introduced as a decision support tool for transportation policymaking, where the sustainability index considers multi- dimensional conflicting criteria in the transportation planning process. The pro- posed framework should help decision-makers with incorporating sustainability considerations into transportation planning as well as identifying the most sustainable (or least unsustainable) plan for predetermined objectives.

AB  - Within only two decades olive oil developed from a niche product which could hardly be found in food stores outside the producing regions towards an integrated component in the diets of industrial countries. This paper discusses the impacts of the promotion of the " healthy Mediterranean diet" on land use and agro-ecosystems in the producing countries. It examines the dynamics of olive oil production, trade and consumption in the EU15 in the period 1972-2003 and the links between dietary patterns, trade and land use. It analyses the underlying socio-economic driving forces behind the increasing spatial disconnect between production and consumption of olive oil in the EU15 and in particular in Spain, the world largest producer during the last three decades.In the observed period olive oil consumption increased 16-fold in the non-producing EU15 countries. In the geographically limited producing regions like Spain, the fivefold increase in export production was associated with the rapid industrialization of olive production, the conversion of vast Mediterranean landscapes to olive monocultures and a range of environmental pressures. High amounts of subsidies of the European Common Agricultural Policy and feedback loops within production and consumption systems were driving the transformation of the olive oil system. Our analysis indicates the process of change was not immediately driven by increases in demand for olive oil in non-producing countries, but rather by the institutional setting of the European Union and by concerted political interventions. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - Traditionally, cities have been perceived as ‘aggression against the environment’ and urban land uses are supposed to have profound negative impacts on surrounding ecosystems. According to these notions, cities are suffering from an increasing deficit of green spaces and habitats. Green spaces and recreational areas are becoming a precious good within the urbanised world and a resource to preserve and enlarge if possible. Although a variety of urban ‘green land uses’ exists, this article focuses on examining their functionality in quantitative and qualitative terms using the concepts of quality of life and ecosystem services. We develop an integrative scheme that incorporates components of both concepts, and we ask further how they might be affected by uneven spatial development of shrinking cities possessing ‘islands of growth’. Using this approach we can show, first, that both concepts partially are complementary using similar variables, but following different mental models. Second, we make explicit the fact that shrinkage has positive as well as negative implications for urban green land use patterns and functionality.

The most common impact fee program includes a range of street and road projects, the cost of which are partially paid by new development based upon their usage of these facilities. The purpose of this paper is to describe an innovative application of impact fees to pay for transit and nonmotorized improvements in Portland OR. The City of Portland initiated a study of System Development Charges, or SDC's to help pay for growth impacts on a variety of multimodal facilities. The city is largely built-out with respect to roads, but has an aggressive program to improve transit and nonmotorized facilities. The City and a consultant team developed several innovative methods to attribute the impacts of growth to projects such as corridor-level transit facilities, sidewalks, bike lanes, and a downtown streetcar system. Special steps were needed to convert the traditional ITE vehicle trip generation rates into comparable rates for the transit and nonmotorized modes. The paper details the methodology, analysis techniques, and assumptions required. In addition, the paper describes the steps used to gain acceptance of the controversial impact fee program by a diverse group of citizens and business interests.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - Standard urban economic theory suggests that stringent urban land-use regulation leads to higher housing prices due to both direct impacts on costs and a reduction in the price elasticity of supply. Indonesia has one of the most restrictive land registration and construction permitting systems in Asia, yet housing is affordable, rates of household formation are high, and housing supply is relatively elastic. This paper explores the relationship between land use regulations and housing markets in Indonesia through various analyses; an overview of 90 cities, a direct assessment of the relationship in 15 cities, and detailed case studies of two medium-sized cities. Regulations do impact the production of housing in Indonesia, but they do not affect housing markets in the predicted way because of their flexible enforcement and a widespread and dynamic informal housing-production system. The main impact of the strict land-use regulations in Indonesia is thus argued to be under investment in physical infrastructure related to housing; a substantial detriment to urban development and economic growth. The case of Indonesia demonstrates the importance of regulatory enforcement and local context in the analysis of land use regulations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transportation and land use research of the past decade has focused in large part on the question of whether manipulating land uses in the direction of smart growth alternatives can reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or otherwise improve travel behavior. Yet the notion of manipulating land uses implies that the alternative is somehow self-organized or market-based. This view appears to underestimate the extent to which current planning interventions in the United States largely focused on lowering development densities, mandating ample road and parking designs, and separating land uses impose an auto-oriented template on most new development. Rather than a market failure, the paucity of smart growth alternatives may be a planning failure the result of municipal regulatory exclusion. This problem definition would shift the burden of proof for policy reform, as uncertainty in travel-behavior benefits would hardly justify the con- tinuation of exclusionary regulations. If municipal regulations in fact constrain alternatives to low- density, auto-oriented development, one would expect developers to perceive unsatisfied market interest in such development. This article studies, through a national survey (676 respondents), US developers perceptions of the market for pedestrian-and transit-oriented development forms. Overall, respondents perceive considerable market interest in alternative development forms, but believe that there is inadequate supply of such alternatives relative to market demand. Developer- respondents attribute this gap between supply and demand principally to local government regu- lation. When asked how the relaxation of these regulations would affect their product, majorities of developers indicated that such liberalization would lead them to develop in a denser and more mixed-use fashion, particularly in close-in suburban locales. Results are interpreted in favor land- policy reform based on the expansion of choice in transportation and land use. This view contrasts with a more prevalent approach which conditions policy interventions on scientific evidence of travel-behavior modification.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - A simple model is proposed, at the macrolevel of variable aggregation, as a support for policy making in the control of goods transportation growth by possible alternative modes. The impact of feasible changes in the levying of "carbon tax" can be investigated with the proposed model, as well as the effects of investments in infrastructure and of the coverage of operational costs. Based on some transport externalities, various cost indices are identified and suitably minimized using optimization techniques, so that a quantitative definition of public policies can be derived. As an example, the model is used to evaluate an application of alternative policies in Germany. This case study shows that the model system of goods transportation has a slight sensitivity to the public interventions considered. The application of the carbon tax shows significant effects on the increase of fiscal revenues rather than on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and on the share of road transportation. Reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and in transportation by road are best achieved by higher investment in the infrastructures of alternative modes of transport, together with a reduction in fuel taxation.

AB  - Pressures on urban policy-makers in Africa to formalize land tenure and land delivery systems are mounting, while at the same time there is increased demand for informal access to urban land for subsistence production and low-cost housing. In Kampala, Uganda, semi-subsistence agriculture is an important component of the urban economy, yet it is a technically illegal form of land use and largely misunderstood by urban authorities and policy-makers. This paper analyzes the means of access to land, much of it informal, and discusses possible policy responses to competing demands over urban and peri-urban land.

AB  - The results of the performed screening study indicates that it is possible to transport CO2 over large distances within a reasonable unit cost. It is evident that the effect of large scale solutions to reduce unit costs are substantial. The transportation unit cost for a fully utilized large diameter pipeline over 1500 kilometers is estimated at approximately 6$ per tonne, while transportation through a 16 inch pipeline, corresponding to CO2 from a single 1000 MW gas fired power station, over the same distance, is approximately 42$ per tonne. The transportation cost should be compared with carbon tax of 50$ per tonne CO2 in force in Norway and the proposed EC energy / carbon tax of 10 $ per barrel of oil, which is equivalent to approximately 24 $ per tonne CO2. Large diameter pipelines require large investments and multilateral agreement. Therefore, the possibilities to establish an integrated large scale CO2 transportation system across country borders and continents is a possibility, but the perspective is long term. Although an integrated large scale CO2 transportation system is not likely to appear in our decade or even in the next two or three, it may turn out to be the chosen solution for the mid 21th Century if we are entering a greenhouse driven future.

The objective of ILUMASS was to implement a fully microscopic model of urban land use, transport, and environment (LTE). Considerable progress was made in developing and testing individual microscopic models and the interfaces between them. However, for several reasons, the planned application of the full model system for the simulation of policy scenarios was not achieved. Possible reasons for this failure are analyzed and recommendations are made to improve future interdisciplinary projects of this kind.

AB  - This article reviews empirical studies of the relationship between transportation facilities—highways, heavy rail, and light rail transit systems—and property values. The main ob- jective is to develop an explanation for inconsistent results presented in this literature over the past several decades. Results from these studies vary based on whether travel time or travel distance is used as a measure of accessibility. When researchers measure access to highways and rail transit in terms of travel time, study results usually indicate the expected inverse relationship between access to transportation facilities and property values. When studies use travel distance as a measure of access to transportation facilities, results tend to show mixed property value effects. The delineation of study areas also appears to influence the direction of results. This article offers a new interpretation of the transportation facility-property value literature that improves our ability to measure this relationship and to anticipate land-market responses to transportation facilities.

AB  - Oregon's landmark land use planning system has been criticized for imposing large negative effects on landowners' property values, although evidence to support these claims has been lacking. This paper examines longitudinal data for undeveloped parcels since before adoption of the planning system. The sample includes parcels under different land use regulations, and it compares Oregon to Washington. The results indicate generally that property values have increased at similar rates both inside and outside urban growth boundaries, and across parcels zoned for different uses and across state lines. The results are consistent both with theory and with other studies indicating land use regulations can have positive, neutral or negative effects. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - We demonstrate here an electrostatic MEMS system capable of transporting particles 5-10 ??m in diameter in air. This system consists of three-phase electrode arrays covered by insulators. Extensive testing of this system has been done using a variety of insulation materials (silicon nitride, photoresist and Teflon), thickness (0-12 ??m), particle sizes (1-10 ??m), particle materials (metal, glass, polystyrene, spores, etc.), waveforms, frequencies and voltages. Although previous literatures claimed it is impractical to electrostatically transport particles with sizes 5-10 ??m due to complex surface forces, this effort actually shows it is feasible (as high as 90% efficiency) using the optimal combination of insulation thickness, electrode geometry and insulation material. Moreover, we suggest a qualitative theory for our particle transportation system which is consistent with our data and finite-element electrostatic simulations.

These tests also reveal that transportation energy cost is an important variable in determining metropolitan structure and the location of urban activities.

AB  - China's population was 1.1 billion in 1990; it is expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2000. Its urban population was 33% in 1990 and is expected to grow to 47% by 2000. This enormous urban growth poses tremendous challenges to urban transportation planners. The five magacities-Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Wuhan-are planning for light rail transit/subway (LRT/MRT) systems that will cost $10 billion to $15 billion (U.S. dollars). However, China does not have the money and will depend on foreign aid and borrowing. Concurrently planners disagree about the appropriate role of motorized and nonmotorized transportation, especially the bicycle: some wish to abolish, restrict, or redirect it, and others wish to expand its systems role. The global LRT/MRT experience suggests that such systems are expensive and take a long time to build. Forecasting systems for cost and ridership are unreliable; actual costs are more than two or three times the forecast. The urban transportation trends and issues in China are discussed on the basis of a very diverse array of data research sources. The analysis includes mode splits, costs, and reliability functions, and their applicability to Chinese cities. It proposes a strategic planning framework for Chinese urban areas, focusing on optimum modal mixes, investment and regulatory policies, and transportation system management. Although the framework has been developed particularly for China, it is generally applicable to other low-income countries in Asia.

AB  - The transportation - urban form nexus lies at the heart of urban sustainability. Transportation provides the physical connectivity between people, firms and activities that permits economic and social interactions to occur. It also provides physical definition to urban areas in terms of the street system and our perceptions of how locations "connect" in space and time. And the accessibility to opportunities that it provides influences land development decisions and location choices of households and businesses. In particular, as urban areas continue to expand, automobile-dominated transportation systems both facilitate and promote inefficient "sprawl" that has ramifications for all elements of urban physical and social infrastructure (water, handling of wastes, schools, heath care, etc.) in addition to the transportation system per se. Urban form (i.e., the spatial distribution of people, businesses and other activities), in turn, fundamentally determines both travel demand and the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of transportation. Most notably, public transit systems (as well as non-motorised modes of travel such as walking and bicycles) can only provide effective alternatives to the automobile if transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban forms are built. Transportation systems are major generators of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise. They are also almost totally dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels as their source of energy. This paper sketches the broad dimensions of the modern urban transportation design problem, with emphasis on its connections with other elements of urban design, particularly the question of urban form. These dimensions include both physical infrastructure and services (roads, transit services, etc.) and the intelligent operational control of these facilities and services. Elements of a coordinated research program to address pressing short- and long-run urban transportation planning problems are then outlined.

AB  - In transportation engineering, the network design problem (NDP) aims at\nfinding an optimal link improvement in a network for given demand.\nAlthough traffic demand is essentially uncertain, many previous studies\nassumed it to be deterministic. The demand stochasticity is incorporated\nand formulas are developed for system-optimal (SO) flow stochastic NDP.\nThe SO assumption is justified by comparing results from SO\ndeterministic NDP with those of user-equilibrium NDP. The difference in\nsocial cost between the two approaches is found to be less than 5%. Two\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with recourse formulations are proposed:\none with penalty function and the other without. The main advantage of\nthe first formulation is that a planner can exert better control on\nimprovement by appropriately weighing reduction in the congestion versus\nimprovement costs. The challenge, however, lies in selecting an\nappropriate penalty function. A nonlinear penalty function is found\nsuitable for the test network studied. The second formulation does not\nrequire penalty function but results in a large number of scenarios.\nNonanticipativity constraints are introduced in the second formulation\nto arrive at uniform improvement over all scenarios. Both formulations\nare solved on a test network. It is found that necessary improvements\nand the total costs with both models are more than those for average\ndemand.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously.

When existing good practices are built upon, urban forestry has shown significant contributions to the quality of urban life and the environment, together with other types of comprehensive green-space planning and management concepts. Through agroforestry systems, for example, urban forestry and urban agriculture join forces in supporting livelihoods. A review of the current status of urban forestry research and development, policy-making, implementation and education across the globe shows that advances have indeed been made. Urban forestry has been developed in response to the call for innovative, comprehensive concepts that promote the multiple benefits of urban green space. Sometimes named urban and peri-urban forestry, the concept encompasses the planning and management of forests and other tree resources in and close to urban areas and thus integrates different parts of urban green structures.

AB  - With the rapid implementation of intelligent transportation systems throughout the nation, the surface transportation system has become dependent on an extensive network of communication and computing devices. It is no longer sufficient to consider the analysis of the transportation network, its communication infrastructure, and its power supply in separation. Given the increased threats to surface transportation networks, it is imperative that such systems be designed not only for safety and efficiency but also for survivability. A case study to assess the survivability of a small urban transportation system is presented. Two different survivability assessment techniques are presented and applied. The first approach provides a qualitative assessment and is based on a survivable systems analysis modified for critical infrastructures. The second technique provides a quantitative assessment of network survivability using a multilayered graph-based approach. Three layers of critical infrastructure in a transportation system are analyzed: power, information, and physical. Interactions within layers and between layers are identified, and the relative criticality of each component in the three layers is quantified as to the component's essentiality to network performance. The analysis provides a simple means of assessing the importance of different components in critical infrastructure layers, allowing decision makers to prioritize threat mitigation alternatives.
