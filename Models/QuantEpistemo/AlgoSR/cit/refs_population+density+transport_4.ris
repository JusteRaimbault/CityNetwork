AB  - Abstract By studying the responses of different species to urbanization, it is possible to understand the impact of this type of habitat modification and to explore, more generally, the link between variations in the environment and changes in behaviour. We radio collared 17 badgers Meles meles from six social groups in a 1km2 urban study area in Brighton, UK, where local badger population density was high, and collected data on their ranging behaviour between 2005 and 2007. We aimed to determine how badgers adapt their behaviour to an urban environment and to assess the generality of previously reported differences in the ranging and territorial behaviour of urban and rural badgers. Analysis of habitat preferences and movement patterns suggested that garden habitat was principally used for foraging, while scrub and allotment habitats were important in allowing animals to travel from one part of their range to another. Group and individual home ranges were the smallest so far recorded for badgers (mean 100% minimum convex polygons=9.26 and 4.91�ha, respectively). Individual range size was negatively correlated with the availability of garden habitat, suggesting that the rich food resources provided by gardens enabled ranges to be small. Group ranges were mostly non-contiguous and there was no evidence of territorial scent marking; rather, activity was mainly restricted to areas in the vicinity of main setts. It is clear that badgers can adapt successfully to urban habitats and that this process affects various aspects of their behaviour. However, our high-density population of urban badgers displayed patterns of behaviour that differed not only from those of typical rural badgers, but also in some respects from those of a previously studied low-density urban population. We conclude that generalizations about the effects of urbanization must be made with caution.

AB  - Fishers (Martes pennanti) were almost extirpated in Ontario, Canada, south of the French and Mattawa rivers by the 1940s but have recolonized much of their former range over the past several decades. We assessed the effect of the current harvest quota on a fisher population in eastern Ontario by estimating home range size and population density from a sample of radiocollared animals. Mean (± SD) adult home ranges (based on annual 95% min. convex polygons) were consistently smaller than those reported in the literature (M: 11 ± 4.4 km2; F: 2.1 ± 0.8 km2), with up to 71% overlap of adjacent intrasexual home ranges. This yielded an estimated adult fisher population density of 32.7/100 km2 of suitable habitat, as defined by the habitat composition within observed home ranges. We further estimated that between 2003 and 2005, trappers harvested 17.8-42.3% of the pretrapping population. These results suggest that although current fisher population density is high in our study area compared to reported densities in other areas, harvest rate is also high and an increase in quota is unwarranted.

AB  - Astudy of home range and habitat use was carried out on grey partridge (Perdix perdix) in a high density population (24–33 pairs /km2 ) in the south-west part of Praha, Czech Republic from 1997 to 1999. Radiotracking of individual partridge was used in the study (n = 11). Breeding period (March – June 15) and post-breeding period (June 16 – October) were analysed separately. Home range size (minimum convex polygon 95%) in the breeding period averaged 3.7 ha with a significant increase up to 8.7 ha in the post-breeding period. The majority of partridge ranges were located within dominant crop fields and idle habitats (unmanaged early stages of plant succession) referred to as weeds. Both high population density and small individual home ranges may result from the wide availability of weeds, whose attractiveness was probably due to availability of nesting sites, sufficient food supply for both partridge chicks and adults and adequate escape cover. Despite a high population density, there is an indication of little home range overlaps between pairs during the breeding period.

AB  - When plotted along a gradient of population density, the mean group size in populations of several primate species has a unimodal distribution, i.e., mean group size is greater at intermediate population densities than at higher or lower population densities. In this study I present a mathematical model to clarify the cause of this relationship. Population density is assumed to affect group size by enhancing between- or within-group competition and by changing the number of neighboring groups around each group. The mean group size is predicted to decline as population density increases above a critical value, owing to the increasing number of neighboring groups

AB  - We compiled studies that report data on the relationship between animal population density and patch or island area for 287 individual species and 21 faunas. We tested the assumption of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography that population densities are independent of area by performing a meta-analysis using the linear correlation coefficient. r, as a measure of the effect of area on population density. We fit meta-analyses that used a random-effects model to these data to test far the effects of taxa. habitat, latitude, spatial scale, and overall population density. We also fit meta-analyses that used a fixed-effect model to the same data to estimate the repeatability of measurements of the correlation between population density and area within species. Contrary to the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, our results indicate that, on average, animal population densities are positively correlated with area, which suggests that density compensation may be uncommon. This result was found fur individual species, but not for faunas. We found taxonomic differences in the correlation between population density and area, with insects and birds having on average large or moderately large positive correlations, respectively, and mammals having correlations near zero, Observations within individual species showed considerable repeatability. The observed overall positive correlation between the population density of individual animal species and area is best explained in the context of the resource concentration hypothesis. Our results imply that the regional abundance and persistence of animal populations may depend strongly on the presence and continued persistence of a few large patches of suitable habitat, rather than on a regional network of small and large habitat patches

AB  - The title of this paper implies that reproductive success may be related to population density. Consequently it also implies that the regulation of population growth also may be related to density, assuming that patterns of mortality are not completely aberrant. Such relationships are well recognized. However, one need not go far back to find marked disagreement between the advocates of “density-dependent” regulation of population growth and the proponents of “density-independent” regulation by such factors as climate, availability of water, and the like. Of course, it should have been anticipated that both kinds of mechanisms operate depending on the species and the circumstances. Thus one might reasonably expect density-independent mechanisms to be more important in marginal habitats, for newly introduced aliens or, for that matter, for native populations whose biotic environment has been grossly altered. Also, one would expect increasing manifestation of density dependence with increasing independence from the environment, as with homeothermy in contrast to poikilothermy in terrestrial animals. There should be no necessity for categorically relegating either group of regulating mechanisms to insignificance, as each must be considered in the context of the particular population under scrutiny as well as its setting. However, this account is concerned mainly with density-dependent mechanisms in mammals, particularly in rodents, and primarily with respect to their reproduction.

AB  - Pregnancy costs the lives of half a million women every year—the equivalent of one woman dying every minute. Most of these deaths are avoidable, but how best to avoid them is a subject of debate among public health professionals. The debate turns on the question of whether or not maternal mortality rates can be reduced using the method that was so effective in lowering child mortality rates: an approach focusing on the provision of inexpensive, preventive health measures. Proponents of this strategy say that providing basic prenatal health care to pregnant women, and training traditional birth attendants to recognize serious labor and delivery complications, can go a long way toward preventing maternal mortality. Others argue that, while such services can improve women's health, they will not lower maternal mortality rates because the major causes of maternal deaths—emergency obstetric conditions—are not preventable. Nor are they predictable: "Some of the women in the so-called low-risk group will experience serious complications and . . . some (in many cases, most) of the women in the high-risk group will not. In many instances, most of the problems arise among women in the low-risk group," concludes a Population Council report, titled "A reassessment of the concept of reproductive risk in maternity care and family planning services." Given these facts, some public health professionals contend that the only effective way to reduce maternal mortality rates is to improve the management of emergency obstetric conditions in developing countries, where 99 percent of maternal deaths occur.

AB  - The modelling of the tangential strain rate term in the Flame Surface Density (FSD) transport equation in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of turbulent premixed combustion has been addressed by a priori analysis of a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) database of statistically planar freely propagating flames with wide variations of Damk??hler number Da, heat release parameter ?? and global Lewis number Le. It has been found that the dilatation rate contribution to the FSD transport strengthens with increasing value of ?? and decreasing value of Le. The behaviour of the normal strain rate term shows significant differences in response to Da and Le. It has been found that the normal strain rate contribution to the FSD transport remains a sink term for the flames with high and small values of Da and Le, respectively, where the effects of strain rate induced by heat release achem overcome the effects of turbulent straining aturb. By contrast, the effects of aturb overcomes the effects of achem for low Da flames with Le???1, which leads to a positive value of the normal strain rate term towards the unburned gas side, but this term becomes negative towards the burned gas side due to strong achem overcoming aturb in the regions of intense heat release. The strengthening of the dilatation rate and achem at small and large values of Le and Da, respectively, is explicitly taken into account to propose new models for the strain rate contributions to the FSD transport. The new model is shown to satisfactorily capture the effects of Damk??hler number Da, heat release parameter ??, and global Lewis number Le, on the tangential strain rate term of the FSD transport equation for all the cases considered in this study. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

The modeler may, however, be interested in estimating the distribution of parameter values in the population from which the individuals are sampled. Some applications of population estimation, a survey of approaches to the estimation problem and some current work will be discussed. The approaches discussed include the "naive pooled data approach," two stage methods, the first order method proposed by Sheiner and Beal and a nonparametric maximum likelihood procedure. General approaches employing Bayes' Theorem are also considered.

AB  - Four experiments were conducted to study the effects of population density on layer performance. in each experiment, 20-wk--old White leghorn pullets were housed in 30.5 x 50.8 cm cages at the rate of one, two, three, and four birds per cage for Treatments 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. in Experiment 4, there were three additional treatments: for Treatments 5, 6, and 7, birds were placed into identical cages (30.5 x 50.8 cm) at the rate of three, two, and three birds per cage, respectively, at 20 wk of age. At 28 wk of age, one bird was removed from each cage in Treatment 5, and one bird was added to each cage in Treatments 6 and 7. In the first three experiments, all eggs that were collected for 2 consecutive d every 8 wk starting at 28 wk of age were used to measure egg traits. In Experiment 4, egg traits were determined once at 52 week of age. Birds at the highest population density had the lowest percentage hen-day egg production and had one of the poorest feed efficiencies. Egg production was negatively correlated (P < or = .01, Experiments 1, 2, 3; P < or = .05, Experiment 4) with population density. Feed required to produce a dozen eggs was positively correlated (P < or = .01, Experiments 1, 2; P < or = .05, Experiment 3) with population density in three out of the four experiments. The addition or removal of a cage mate to or from a multiple-bird cage in Experiment 4 did not (P > .05) affect egg production or feed efficiency. Final BW, mortality, and egg weight were not (P > .05) affected by population density. Only in one out of the four experiments was feed consumption (Experiment 1), eggshell thickness (Experiment 2), or albumen height (Experiment 3 lowered (P < or = .05) by having more than one bird per cage. This study showed that increasing population density decreased laying performance of the birds.

AB  - The negative relationship between population density and body mass with the body mass exponent of -0.75 implies that the energy flow through populations of small- and large-bodied species is the same, for individual metabolism scales to body mass raised to the power of +0.75. This relationship called the energetic equivalence rule, has often been observed for mammal species assemblages studied at regional scales. Here we suggest a demography-based mechanism that may generate it. Having analyzed about 130 literature sources, mostly in Russian, we collected demography and body-mass data for 88 mammalian species from the territory and coastal waters of the former Soviet Union. The data were used to construct a number of interspecific relationships. It is shown that (1) the number of offspring per lifetime is approximately inversely proportional to the relative mass at birth (the exponent is not significantly different from -1), (2) the average lifespan is proportional to body mass to the 0.25 power, (3) body mass at birth is proportional to the adult body mass. We develop a simple theory to demonstrate that relations (1) to (3) entail the energetic equivalence rule. The theory also allows us to explain violation of this rule (in non-flying birds, for example), namely, to predict the exponent of relation (1) for any given exponent of the relation between population density and body mass. This is possible because relations (2) and (3) are likely to more universally hold than relation (1). Finally, since natural selection acts on individual traits rather than on population-level ones such as population density, the theory opens up the way to an evolutionary explanation for the energetic equivalence rule.

AB  - Brown Kiwi (Apteryx mantelli) are in serious decline despite immense conservation efforts. The lack of fundamental information on Kiwi breeding is in part because of the low density of most populations and their nocturnal habits. We report on the nesting success and breeding ecology of an exceptionally high-density population of Brown Kiwi over 3 years. Nesting success was high (47%) compared with other Brown Kiwi populations and 85% of failures occurred during incubation. In contrast, fledging success was very high (89%). Most clutches had one egg (69%), and second and replacement clutches were rare. Significantly more chicks hatched in reused nests than previously unused burrows. In addition, two nest usurpations and one cooperative nest were observed. We suggest that competition for resources associated with high densities result in reduced clutch-size, nest reuse and nest usurpation and that such life-history traits are particularly relevant for species such as Brown Kiwi with high energetic demands for breeding. Given that the density of Kiwi on Ponui Island is indicative of pre-human New Zealand, this study provides insights into the breeding ecology of Brown Kiwi not otherwise possible. Indeed, our study reveals certain previously unknown aspects of Brown Kiwi life-history indicating ecological resilience.

AB  - Antibiotic consumption and population density as a measure of crowding in the community were related to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance of three cities in three different countries: St Johns in Newfoundland (Canada), Athens in Greece and Groningen in The Netherlands. Antibiotic consumption was expressed in DDD (defined daily dose), as DID (DDD/1000 inhabitants/day) and as DSD (DDD/km(2)). The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Escherichia coli and enterococci was determined in faecal samples of healthy volunteers. In both Newfoundland (28 DID) and Greece (29 DID) the overall consumption of antibiotics was more than three times higher compared with that of The Netherlands (9 DID). The lowest prevalence of resistant E. coli against the majority of antibiotics tested was found for the samples from Newfoundland and was significant (P < 0.05) for cefazolin, oxytetracycline and trimethoprim. A poor correlation between the number of DID and the prevalence of resistance was observed [the Pearson correlation coefficient (Pcc) ranged between -0.93 and 0.87]. However, when population density was taken into consideration and antibiotic consumption was expressed in DSD, a strong correlation was observed (and Pcc ranged between 0.86 and 1.00). This study suggests that population density is an important factor in the development of antibiotic resistance and warrants special attention as a factor in resistance epidemiology.

AB  - Despite the importance of conservation and management of the European hare, a game species that has declined throughout Europe, little is known about its natal dispersal process. To date, only one radio-tracking study in a mixed cropping-farmed landscape provides a fine description of the dispersal pattern of this species. The study shows in particular a negative density dependence dispersal, juvenile hares dispersing more in a low-density hunting zone rather than in a high density non-hunting zone. Unfortunately, the effect of conspecific density on dispersal remains ambiguous due to the confounding effect of hunting. To provide more insight into the influence of conspecific numbers on the dispersal propensity in hares, we renewed the study in a harvested high density population. Our results confirmed the known sex-biased and age-related dispersal in this species but we did not find any effect of the birth site density on either the propensity to disperse or the distance moved in juvenile hares. Overall, the dispersal rate and bias were equal to those previously found in the high density non-hunting zone, where density was almost the same as in our population even though hunting pressure differed. Our results emphasize that natal dispersal is a ubiquitous feature in this species, which may respond more to density than hunting. © 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft für Säugetierkunde.

AB  - An individual-based simulation model was used to study the effect of the relative location of food and nest sites in the landscape on the relationship between the breeding habitat patch size and bird population density. The model predicted that when both food and nest sites are located exclusively in the breeding habitat patches, larger patches tend to harbor higher population densities. But when food starts to be added to the ‘matrix’ habitat and taken out of the breeding habitat the advantageous effect of larger patches diminishes and eventually the trend reverses, with small patches having higher population densities. This pattern arises from the combined effect of the existence of an extended foraging area around patches and an intrinsic advantage of large habitat patches associated with the concentration of food resources and potential colonizers. The effects of interspecific interactions and the management implications of the model are discussed

Mortality and degree of iono-osmoregulatory disturbance were negligible. Simulated transport caused a general stress response, as indicated by an increase in plasma cortisol and glucose levels. No differences were recorded between the fish sampled after 24 h and after 48 h. Oxygen consumption during the first 24 h of simulated transport was the same as that recorded some days later for fish kept at a lower density. There were no differences in muscle and liver glycogen content, or in muscle lactate content of the different groups. The metabolic effects of simulated transport therefore appeared to be moderate. The results indicate that cod can be transported at very high densities provided they receive sufficient supplies of oxygen.

AB  - Two widely tested empirical patterns in ecology are combined here to predict how the variation of population density relates to the average body size of organisms. Taylor's law (TL) asserts that the variance of the population density of a set of populations is a power-law function of the mean population density. Density-mass allometry (DMA) asserts that the mean population density of a set of populations is a power-law function of the mean individual body mass. Combined, DMA and TL predict that the variance of the population density is a power-law function of mean individual body mass. We call this relationship "variance-mass allometry" (VMA). We confirmed the theoretically predicted power-law form and the theoretically predicted parameters of VMA, using detailed data on individual oak trees (Quercus spp.) of Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, New York. These results connect the variability of population density to the mean body mass of individuals.

AB  - In the Netherlands, a public transport monitoring system has been introduced to provide decision-makers and stakeholders the necessary management information. It has been designed primarily for the purposes of policy formulation and project development. It also serves as a source of information to inform the general public regarding the public transport situation in their region compared with other regions in the country . It is officially known as the OV-Monitor (Public Transport Monitor). It covers all form of public transport, except the railways which has it own Users'Surveys. OV-Monitor contains detailed information on the supply, usage, quality and the fares revenue of urban and regional public transport. The data is collected, collated and made available in the internet. The OV-Monitor covers the whole of the Netherlands which is currently comprised of 74 concession regions. For each region, information is available on aspects such as modal split, passenger-kilometres, frequency of services, possibilities to link-up with connecting bus services and the reactions of the users. The last aspects is the primary subject of this paper. However, the paper will in its introduction give the background information leading to its introduction, the objectives of the project, its set-up and usage. Catering for the travelling needs of the general public has been the main theme in the planning philosophy in the Netherlands. In the public transport sector, it has generally been recognised that the existing and potential passengers are the clients and public transport services should be tailor-made to serve their requirements. To this end, the OV-Monitor has been constructed to assist officials from the transport authority and the operators. An important component of the system is the Customers'Survey Study. The research information serves as a kind of barometer to give insights into two important questions:Which aspect of the public transport services are important to the customers and how satisfied are the customers with respect tro each of the quality aspect. A large scale questionairre survey is undertaken once every year in the 74 concession regions. The transport authorities at the national and local levels together with the operators have (on the basis of earlier research findings)together identified 32 quality aspects as important. These quality aspects have been grouped together into a consistent and cohesive set of indicators covering information, security, comfort. travel time. journey costs and facilities available. For each aspect, the passenger was invited to give a score using a 10 points scale. The system is now in use and has been introduced since 2001. The paper will describe the methodology used, the quality of the results and illustrate how the findings are being used to support decision making and the benchmarking of performances between concession regions and performance over time.

AB  - Turbulent reaction rate closure modelling using the concept of Flame Surface Density (FSD) is now well-established in the context of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations. In the present study, three-dimensional DNS data is explicitly filtered in order to evaluate different terms of the FSD transport equation in the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Existing sub-models for these unclosed terms are assessed with respect to the filtered DNS data, resulting in a recommended modelled form for each term. Previously assessed modelling of the propagation and curvature terms is combined with new model formulations for the turbulent transport and strain rate terms to produce a complete modelled FSD transport equation for use in LES. Displacement speed is shown to play a pivotal role in the modelling of several terms and its curvature dependence is explicitly accounted for in order to ensure that the FSD model will be valid in both the corrugated flamelets and the thin reaction zones regimes.

The population on the control renliiined at peak densities. The enclosed population increased to even higher density once lhe hreedingseason had started and had a higher survival rate than the control population. By midsummer the enclosed population had severely overgrazed the vegetation and went into a sharp decline. Dispersal losses from the control were estimated at 32% for males and 31% for femiiles in these high-density populations. Microtus tonwsendii populations thus responded to ;I fence in o manner similar to that ofother species that have been studied.

AB  - Death and disability from ischemic heart disease, trauma, and other medical emergencies may be reduced significantly by developing an Emergency Medical Services system based on training for the nonmedical population in basic life-support skills; this is particularly appropriate in high-density population centers where professional response time is complicated by confestion and traffic. A pilot project in New York City, which designed and implemented a first-response capability for medical emergencies in corporations, using employees in a system congruent with the fire warden plans in effect, was completed in May 1977. To obtain an initial assessment of the medical impact of such training and the effectiveness of such a medical emergency response system during the pilot phase, The Regional Emergency Medical Services Council of New York City, Inc., obtained reports from the 24 participating corporations on all reported medical and surgical emergencies occurring in the working environment. The authors conclude that this approach to development of a first response-capability can provide an effective community base for an effective Emergency Medical Services system in urban areas.

AB  - Population density, or the number of adults in an environment relative to the limiting resources, may have important long and short term consequences for the longevity of organisms. In this paper we summarize the way in which crowding may have an immediate impact on longevity, either through the phenomenon known as dietary restriction or through alterations in the quality of the environment brought on by the presence of large numbers of individuals. We also consider the possible long term consequences of population density on longevity by the process of natural selection. There has been much theoretical speculation about the possible impact of population density on the evolution of longevity but little experimental evidence has been gathered to test these ideas. We discuss some of the theory and empirical evidence that exists and show that population density is an important factor in determining both the immediate chances of survival and the course of natural selection.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of climate, geography, census area and the distribution of body mass on the mass : density relationship in terrestrial mammal populations. Location The areas covered include most major terrestrial biomes including the tropics, savannas, and temperate forests. Method Data on population density and body mass from 827 populations belonging to 330 different terrestrial mammal species were derived from a review of the literature. Results LOWESS and polynomial regression analysis indicated that the overall mass : density relationship on log-log scales was not linear and that the slope of this relationship behaves differently across the range of body mass. Body mass explained between 37 and 67% of the variability in population density depending upon the dietary category or the biome group. We also developed two multivariate models that can explain up to 65% of the variability in population density in terrestrial mammals. We also tested for a confounding effect of census area on the mass : density relationship on log-log scales in terrestrial mammals. Conclusions Our findings support previous studies suggesting that body mass is a major predictor of the variance in population density in terrestrial mammals. We suggest that the nonlinearity of the mass : density relationship may result from the fact that the overall distribution of body mass is a mixture of distributions across dietary groups and biomes. In contrast to body mass, our results indicate that climatic and geographical factors have a minor effect on population density. Although census area was closely correlated with body mass, body mass was generally a better predictor of population density than was census area.

AB  - A model is proposed with the following features: (1) there is a publicly accessible transport technology, which is more advanced when there is more specialized labor in it; (2) a high population density facilitates the development of the transport technology; (3) an improved transport technology facilitates a finer division of labor, which in turn increases per capita income. These features are compatible with the phenomena of economic development described by Boserup in 1981. It is also shown that, provided the infrastructure sector can charge the users, and individuals are free to choose jobs, the competitive equilibrium will be Paretooptimal.

Radiotracking of individual partridge was used in the study (n = 11). \nBreeding period (March – June 15) and post-breeding period (June 16 – October) were analysed \nseparately. Home range size (minimum convex polygon 95%) in the breeding period averaged \n3.7 ha with a significant increase up to 8.7 ha in the post-breeding period. The majority of \npartridge ranges were located within dominant crop fields and idle habitats (unmanaged early \nstages of plant succession) referred to as weeds. Both high population density and small \nindividual home ranges may result from the wide availability of weeds, whose attractiveness was \nprobably due to availability of nesting sites, sufficient food supply for both partridge chicks and \nadults and adequate escape cover. Despite a high population density, there is an indication of \nlittle home range overlaps between pairs during the breeding period.

The pattern of spatial and temporal predictability in habitat quality dictates whether selection will favor dispersability, diapause, competitive ability or tolerance to crowded conditions. The latter may be indistinguishable from evolution of Allee effects. There exist more alternatives than can be accommodated by the popular epithets r and K selection.

AB  - Densities of sika deer resident in Scottish forests were commonly between 4 and 20 km-2 although densities in the region of 35 km-2 were encountered locally in thicket stage forest. Densities were similar to red deer in all forest stages except pre-felling, where sika attained higher densities (circa 11 km-2). Sika deer spent more time close to the edge of concealing habitats and were more circumspect in their behavior when feeding than red deer. The population of sika deer in South Scotland was estimated by cohort analysis and population simulation to be in the region of 500 to 600 in 1990. It was one of the most fertile populations in Scotland and could sustain a cull in the region of 25% per annum, compared to around 20% for Scottish woodland red deer. Sika were more fertile than red deer, in all age classes

AB  - We analytically study a system of spinless fermions driven at the boundary with an oscillating chemical potential. Various transport regimes can be observed: At zero driving frequency the particle current through the system is independent of the system's length; at the phase-transition frequency, being equal to the bandwidth, the current decays as n -α with the chain length n, α being either 2 or 3; below the transition the scaling of the current is n -1/2, indicating anomalous transport, while it is exponentially small exp(-n/2ξ) above the transition. Therefore, by a simple change of frequency of the a.c. driving of the system one can vary transport from ballistic, anomalous to insulating.

Hypothetical and real actions are compared in an experimental setting where the subjects are given an offer to leave the experiment in advance by paying a given amount of cash. The results show a weak tendency of positive hypothetical bias in the willingness to pay for value of time, though this effect is not different from zero at conventional significance levels. However, certainty calibration, by using the information from a follow-up question where the subjects are self-stating their preference certainty of their hypothetical choice, provides evidence of a significant positive hypothetical bias for non-certain subjects whereas this bias is eliminated for certain subjects.

This is not significantly different from the slope predicted by the energetic equivalence rule. 2. Contrary to previous studies, there is no tendency for the phylogenetic position of an individual tribe to correlate with the strength of the mass-density relationship across its species. 3. However, in line with recent theory, there is a relationship between the degrees of niche overlap among species in a tribe and the abundance pattern of the species. Tribes in which the species appear to share few resources are those in which the relationship between mass and density is most strongly negative.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The relationship between population density and the percentage of teens who electively terminate their pregnancy was the focus of this study. METHODS: The United States population density was determined for each state and each district of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) from the 2000 US Census. The United States teenage pregnancy statistics for females aged 15 to 19 years in 1999 and 2000 were obtained from the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The main measures were the correlation between population density and teen pregnancy rate or teen abortion rate by state and ACOG district. RESULTS: In 2000 there was no significant correlation between population density and the percentage of teenage females who conceived when analyzed by ACOG district (correlation coefficient r = 0.063, P =.87). In contrast, there was a significant correlation between population density and the percentage of pregnant teens who electively terminated their pregnancy when analyzed by ACOG district (r = 0.85, P =.003). In regions of greatest population density the percentage of pregnant teens who electively terminated was about 50%. In regions of least population density the percentage of pregnant teens who electively terminated was about 25%. Similar results were observed when teen pregnancy and abortion data from 1999 were analyzed. CONCLUSION: In the United States population density is not associated with the percentage of teenage females who become pregnant, but it is positively correlated with the percentage of pregnant teens that electively terminate their pregnancy. In areas of low population density teens who become pregnant may prefer birth to pregnancy termination. Alternatively, the access to pregnancy termination services may be suboptimal for teens in geographic areas with low population density. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II-2

AB  - This paper describes the methodology used to produce estimates of the population by ethnic group for local authorities in England and Wales. The approach used is a cohort component methodology with population counts, and each component of population change, constrained to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) national and local authority mid-year population estimates. Consideration is given to the modelling of the ethnic dimension of mortality; fertility (and the allocation of ethnic group to infants); switching between ethnic group categories; and the various aspects of migration, with particular attention given to the application of commissioned Census data. The methodology described is that used for Release 8 of the estimates published in May 2011. The methodology has changed very little since the publication of the first set of estimates in 2006. The paper consists of two parts. The first provides a description of the methodology. The second provides guidance on using the estimates in an informed way.

AB  - Two strategies of home range acquisition by male subadult pine martens (Martes martes) were described from a high-density population inhabiting Białowieża National Park. Four mother-offspring pairs were identified by genetic parentage assignments. Four subadult males showed two different strategies of home range acquisition: dispersal and sedentary. The dispersing males used an area 4-10 times larger than in sedentary subadult males. A sedentary subadult male used his natal area with his mother, and in the following mating season, this male left this area and established a home range that overlapped greatly with another unrelated female near the natal range. A similar high overlap between another subadult male and an unrelated adult female persisted for 3 years. After the death of this female, the male extended his range to overlap slightly with two to four other females. The sedentary strategy adopted by some subadult males may explain the great variation in spacing patterns of solitary mammals.

AB  - An examination of age specific rates of psychiatric admissions within Brooklyn, New York, indicated that population density may function as an intervening variable in the production of mental illness. Measures of household and family contact were found to be significantly correlated to four rates of hospital utilization. These same measures carried unique components that were also significantly related to service use. Other measures of density such as people per acre and structures per acre were found to be unrelated to the rates of psychiatric utilization. The results of this study suggest that if density does produce mental illness its likely mechanism of action will be routed through household contact.

AB  - 1. Many animal species are detected primarily by sound. Although songs, calls and other sounds are often used for population assessment, as in bird point counts and hydrophone surveys of cetaceans, there are few rigorous methods for estimating population density from acoustic data. 2. The problem has several parts 2013 distinguishing individuals, adjusting for individuals that are missed, and adjusting for the area sampled. Spatially explicit capture2013recapture (SECR) is a statistical methodology that addresses jointly the second and third parts of the problem. We have extended SECR to use uncalibrated information from acoustic signals on the distance to each source. 3. We applied this extension of SECR to data from an acoustic survey of ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla density in an eastern US deciduous forest with multiple four-microphone arrays. We modelled average power from spectrograms of ovenbird songs measured within a window of 0·7 s duration and frequencies between 4200 and 5200 Hz. 4. The resulting estimates of the density of singing males (0·19 ha22121 SE 0·03 ha22121) were consistent with estimates of the adult male population density from mist-netting (0·36 ha22121 SE 0·12 ha22121). The fitted model predicts sound attenuation of 0·11 dB m22121 (SE 0·01 dB m22121) in excess of losses from spherical spreading. 5.Synthesis and applications. Our method for estimating animal population density from acoustic signals fills a gap in the census methods available for visually cryptic but vocal taxa, including many species of bird and cetacean. The necessary equipment is simple and readily available; as few as two microphones may provide adequate estimates, given spatial replication. The method requires that individuals detected at the same place are acoustically distinguishable and all individuals vocalize during the recording interval, or that the per capita rate of vocalization is known. We believe these requirements can be met, with suitable field methods, for a significant number of songbird species.

AB  - Using a population density approach we study the dynamics of two interacting collections of integrate-and-fire-or-burst (IFB) neurons representing thalamocortical (TC) cells from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and thalamic reticular (RE) cells from the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN). Each population of neurons is described by a multivariate probability density function that satisfies a conservation equation with appropriately defined probability fluxes and boundary conditions. The state variables of each neuron are the membrane potential and the inactivation gating variable of the low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T). The synaptic coupling of the populations and external excitatory drive are modeled by instantaneous jumps in the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons. The population density model is validated by comparing its response to time-varying retinal input to Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding IFB network composed of 100 to 1,000 cells per population. In the absence of retinal input, the population density model exhibits rhythmic bursting similar to the 7 to 14 Hz oscillations associated with slow wave sleep that require feedback inhibition from RE to TC cells. When the TC and RE cell potassium leakage conductances are adjusted to represent cholingergic neuromodulation and arousal of the network, rhythmic bursting of the probability density model may either persists or be eliminated depending on the number of excitatory (TC to RE) or inhibitory (RE to TC) connections made by each presynaptic cell. When the probability density model is stimulated with constant retinal input (10-100 spikes/sec), a wide range of responses are observed depending on cellular parameters and network connectivity. These include asynchronous burst and tonic spikes, sleep spindle-like rhythmic bursting, and oscillations in population firing rate that are distinguishable from sleep spindles due to their amplitude, frequency, or the presence of tonic spikes. In this context of dLGN/PGN network modeling, we find the population density approach using 2,500 mesh points and resolving membrane voltage to 0.7 mV is over 30 times more efficient than 1,000-cell Monte Carlo simulations.

AB  - The rationale for this study is to test Durkheim's proposition that the division of labor in a society changes with the change in population size and density of a society in a change framework.  Durkheim (1964) specified that an increase in population size (i.e., social volume) influences a change in the division of labor when there is an increase in density.  The county is the basic unit of analysis. To ensure that a sufficient number of counties were included in the analysis, all counties which had reported crime data to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the years of 1940, 1950, 1960, and 1970 were selected.  The total number of counties in the US is 3073 but only 300 counties consistently reported crime data over the time period.  The findings apply only to the 300 counties selected.  The average population of these counties in 1970 was 117,724 and ranged from 202 to 7,032,075.  The population density averaged 147 population per square mile (ppsm) with a range of .2 to 5103 ppsm while the average percent urban was 37.1 with a range of from zero to 99.7.  The division of labor is measured by an index developed by Gibbs and Martin (1962) and modified by Gibbs and Poston (1975)which measures occupational differentiation.  The basic statistical procedure used was regression analysis.  Both zero order correlations and standard partial regression coefficients were computed to test the postulated association between population size, density, urbanization, and the division of labor.  Relationships were examined for 1940-50, 1950-60, 1960-70.  The zero order correlations were inconsistent with Durkheim's proposition.  The correlation between change in population size from 1940-50 and change in the division of labor (DL) 1940-50 were negative.  Similar results occurred with density and urbanization.  The degree of DL in 1940 was positively associated with change in the antecedent variables of population density and urbanization and negatively associated with change in DL.  Comparisons of the variables during 1950-60 indicated a similar pattern.  The 1960-70 comparisons indicated that there is no correlation between change in population size and change in DL and change in urbanization and change in DL.  Change in density was negatively related to DL.  As in the earlier time periods, the level of DL in 1960 was positively related to each of the independent variables.  These data suggest that some interesting things, largely incongruent with Durkheim's postulate are taking place.  The zero order correlations suggest that in all time periods the antecedent variables vary together which is as Durkheim posited, but the division of labor apparently does not increase as the antecedent variables increase.  These findings lend support to the argument that the division of labor may precede rather than follow the ecological changes in a society.  The results of the regression analysis suggest a similar pattern.

AB  - Population density varies widely among U.S. metro areas. A simple, static general equilibrium model demonstrates that moderate differences in metro areas' consumption amenities can cause extremely large differences in their population density. Such amenities are more strongly capitalized into housing prices than into wages. Empirical results suggest that amenities do indeed help support high density levels and that amenities are becoming a more important determinant of where people choose to live. Matching the empirical correlation betweenwages and density requires that amenities cause approximately one fifth of the cross-sectional variation in metro population density. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Habitat fragmentation is a major threat to biodiversity because it disrupts movement between habitat patches. In addition, arthropod fitness may be reduced in fragmented habitats, e.g. due to reduced prey availability. 2. We studied the relationship of spider body condition with habitat fragmentation, population density, and prey availability. We expected that prey availability and population density of spiders would be affected by landscape composition and patch isolation. Body condition should be enhanced by high prey availability, but negatively affected by population density due to competition. 3. We sampled spiders on 30 groups of cherry trees that varied independently in the level of isolation from other woody habitats and in the percentage of woody habitat within 500 m radius. As a measure of body condition, we used residuals of the relationship between individual body mass/opisthosoma width and prosoma width of the two most common orb-weaving spider species, Nuctenea umbratica Clerck and Araniella opisthographa Kulczynski. 4. Body condition of A. opisthographa was positively correlated with the abundance of flies, which increased with the percentage of forest in the landscape. In contrast, body condition of N. umbratica was reduced at high population densities, presumably due to intraspecific competition. In addition, body condition and population density of A. opisthographa was lower at isolated sites. 5. Our study suggests that effects of landscape fragmentation on body condition vary strongly between spider species, depending on the relative role of food limitation and intraspecific competition. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Population density and home range are the two major ecological characteristics pertaining to the ecosystem-level energy use by the species. Home range usually grows more rapidly with body size than does individual metabolic rate. Neither this phenomenon nor the observed absence of isometry between inverse home range and population density (the latter often scaling as the reciprocal of metabolic rate in the inter-ecosystem comparisons) have received a general explanation. Here, we account in theory for the observed scaling exponents in the relationships of population density and inverse home range on body mass and verify our predictions by the available data on birds and mammals. In stable ecosystems, inverse population density and home range represent one and the same measure of animal space use and scale isometrically. Being tightly linked to many genetically encoded morphological and behavioral properties of the species, animal home range, unlike population density, does not change readily with the degree of ecosystem disturbance, thus representing a biological footprint of the undisturbed state of the ecosystem and the animal status within it. The difference between scaling exponents in the mass dependence of home range and inverse population density can reflect the degree of ecosystem disturbance. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - (1) Population densities reported in the literature for a large range of species drawn from different communities typically decrease with increased body size. However, representative samples from feeding guilds within natural communities of both birds and beetles indicate that the highest population densities tend to be recorded from species of intermediate size. The large population densities recorded for some intermediate-sized species, but not small or large-sized species, may be a sampling effect resulting from there being more intermediate-sized species in the communities. (2) Three statistical tests show that, within four guilds of Bornean beetles and two guilds of North American birds, even though the highest population densities are found among species of intermediate size, the average population density and the variance of population densities is broadly similar for species in different size classes. (3) A simulation study showed the shape of the three-dimensional surface formed from the relationships among number of species, population density, and body size for the null distribution within each guild. In most but not all guilds, the shape of the species-density (or species-abundance) curve is broadly similar for each of the size classes. There may be no detectable relationship between body size and population density within many animal communities. (4) Before concluding that a particular community shows a relationship between density and body size, it should be tested against an appropriate null sampling model.

AB  - Mortality data on more than one-third of the world's population is lacking and much of the demographic analysis needed in order to formulate plans for social and economic development is therefore seriously hampered. During recent years the combined efforts at the international and the national levels have re- sulted in significant improvements in remedying this situation. Estimates of mortality levels and of trends, however, are bound to remain the only recourse, as long as some countries have not developed efficient systems of census taking and of vital registration. This report, which has been prepared in partial implementation of the recom- mendation of the Population Commission to intensify demographic studies of under-developed countries, is believed to offer a useful tool in this respect. The series of forty model life-tables, which cover the entire range of mortality varia- tions that can be found today, provide a time- and labour-saving method of ap- proximating the most probable mortality level, by sex and age groups, for any population for which the infant or, better still, the early childhood mortality rate is known with a certain degree of accuracy

AB  - We conducted a factorial simulation experiment to analyze the relative importance of movement pattern, boundary-crossing probability, and mortality in habitat and matrix on population density, and its dependency on habitat fragmentation, as well as inter-patch distance. We also examined how the initial response of a species to a fragmentation event may affect our observations of population density in post-fragmentation experiments. We found that the boundary-crossing probability from habitat to matrix, which partly determines the emigration rate, is the most important determinant for population density within habitat patches. The probability of crossing a boundary from matrix to habitat had a weaker, but positive, effect on population density. Movement behavior in habitat had a stronger effect on population density than movement behavior in matrix. Habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance may have a positive or negative effect on population density. The direction of both effects depends on two factors. First, when the boundary- crossing probability from habitat to matrix is high, population density may decline with increasing habitat fragmentation. Conversely, for species with a high matrix-to-habitat boundary- crossing probability, population density may increase with increasing habitat fragmentation. Second, the initial distribution of individuals across the landscape: we found that habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance were positively correlated with population density when individuals were distributed across matrix and habitat at the beginning of our simulation experiments. The direction of these relationships changed to negative when individuals were initially distributed across habitat only. Our findings imply that the speed of the initial response of organisms to habitat fragmentation events may determine the direction of observed relationships between habitat fragmentation and population density. The time scale of post-fragmentation studies must, therefore, be adjusted to match the pace of post-fragmentation movement responses.

We show that a more realistic version of the model, which combines population and population density, allows deeper insights into these processes. The incorporation of population density also allows a superior interpretation of the empirical regularities between the level of population, population density, population growth, and economic development at aggregated and disaggregated levels.

We hypothesized that persons in more densely populated areas will gather for social interaction in smaller groups, in fewer bisexual groups. As density increases, males will tend to gathes in smaller groups than females. The sample for this study was drawn from three university campuses with varying population density (University of Texas at Austin, Southwest Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas, and Saint Edward's University, Austin, Texas-in order of decreasing density). The number and sex of persons making up interacting groups during the lunch break in the respective cafeterias of these universities was tallied and a typical (average) size group was computed for each university. All hypotheses were supported, indicating a significant inverse relationship between population density and the size of small interacting groups.

AB  - The Bureau of the Census listing of geographical coordinates of centroids of all enumeration districts together with population counts from the U. S. 1970 Census of Population was used to contruct via computer five nationwide geographical grids of population density with sector dimensions of 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.1, and 0.25 degrees of latitude and longitude. The entire population of a district was assigned to a grid sector if the coordinates of the district centroid fell within the boundaries of the sector. The sectors were then rank-ordered according to population density, and listings were made of sector population, population density, geographical location, cumulative population, area of sector, and cumulative area. The five sets of data were synthesized into single equations describing population as a function of density in one case and of area in another. From these data it was found, for example, that about 800,000 people live in 19 sectors of 0.01-degree dimensions with a population density of 100,000 people per square mile or greater (nearly all in Manhattan); about 10 million live in 183 sectors of 0.02-degree dimensions with a population density of 23,000 per square mile or greater; and about half of the total U. S. population, that is, about 100 million people, reside within about 0.6 percent of the area of the United States, that is, within 20,000 square miles.Four representative displays of population density are shown for the Northeast Corridor, including isometric views and a contour map.

AB  - The world's population has grown, in 300 years, from roughly 4?0 million in 1550 to about 2,450 million in 1950. This growth, which is unprecedented in history, has been and still is, continuously accelerating. Despite unusually low birth rates in the 1930's and severe war losses in the 1940's, world population grew, on an average, by about 1 per cent per• annum in every decade since 1920. By 1980, the earth will probably have between 3,300 and 4,000 million inhabitants. Large migrations to• previously sparsely settled continents caused unusually rapid growth in Northern America and Oceania during the past century. The relative importance of migration will be much less in the future. In Europe, population growth was rapid because of declining mortality, but is slowing down because of lowered fertility. The populations of Northern America, Japan, and the Soviet Union will probably follow a similar trend. In Asia, mortality has only begun to decline and will cause an acceleration of population growth. Most rapid growth must be expected in Latin America where birth rates are very high and death rates are already fairly low. Because of insufficient statistics, past and future trends in China and parts of Africa are difficult to determine

AB  - Temporal variability in population density has been shown to increase with increasing length of a study. This has serious implications for ecological studies and suggests that obtaining an objective measure of temporal variability may not be possible. To test this hypothesis more generally, I calculated inter annual variability, using the standard deviation of the logarithm of annual mean population density (STD(log D)), for 70 populations of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish which have been sampled over 10 to 51 consecutive yr in lakes around the world. STD(log D) fluctuates most widely during the first 3 6 yr of a study, but these changes do not necessarily represent long term trends in temporal variability. Median changes in STD(log D) over time are small (<< 0.l unit, even over a logarithmic time scale) and decrease as more years are included in the analysis. The inter annual variability of most freshwater populations appears to reach an asymptotic value. Several populations, however, show an alternation of plateaux and of sudden increases in STD(log D), suggesting that the asymptotic values found in most populations may be temporary and may not extrapolate beyond the temporal scale of this study (10 50 yr). Overall, the increases in inter annual variability are expected to be small(<0.l units, on average, per 25 yr). The pattern and the magnitude of these changes did not differ significantly between algae, zooplankton and fish, and were similar to those reported for birds and mammals. Increases in temporal variability may only be important for questions addressed over long periods of time.

AB  - In food and (or) space-limited populations, increases in average body size may be accompanied by increases in per capita space and (or) energy requirements. Thus, as body size increases in time or space, the equilibrium number of individuals that can be supported in a given environment should decrease. This relationship, referred to as self-thinning, produces a negative linear relationship between log body size (mass) and log population density. We studied body mass population density relationships in stream-living populations of several trout species from the intermountain western United States. Our analyses of relationships between body mass and population density demonstrated that self-thinning can be manifested through both temporal and spatial variability in fish population characteristics. Several populations did not show self-thinning, possibly due to species-specific traits, temporal and spatial environmental variation, or both. Thinning lines may not reveal specific causal mechanisms, but they appear to be real, density-dependent responses and thus offer a potentially useful method for studying fish populations. Experimental studies of self-thinning under more controlled conditions are needed, however, to identify causal mechanisms and eliminate alternative explanations for body size - abundance relationships

AB  - Many habitat fragmentation experiments make the prediction that animal population density will be positively related to fragment, or patch, size. The mechanism that is supposed to result in this prediction is unclear, but several recent reviews have demonstrated that population density often is negatively related to patch size. Immigration behavior is likely to have an important effect on population density for species that do not show strong edge effects, for species that have low emigration rates, and during short-term habitat fragmentation experiments. We consider the effect that different kinds of immigration behaviors will have on population density and we demonstrate that only a minority of possible scenarios produce positive density vs. patch size relationships. More commonly, these relationships are expected to be negative. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering autecological mechanisms, such as immigration behavior, when developing the predictions that we test in habitat fragmentation or other experiments.

AB  - We conducted a factorial simulation experiment to analyze the relative importance of movement pattern, boundary-crossing probability, and mortality in habitat and matrix on population density, and its dependency on habitat fragmentation, as well as inter-patch distance. We also examined how the initial response of a species to a fragmentation event may affect our observations of population density in post-fragmentation experiments. We found that the boundary-crossing probability from habitat to matrix, which partly determines the emigration rate, is the most important determinant for population density within habitat patches. The probability of crossing a boundary from matrix to habitat had a weaker, but positive, effect on population density. Movement behavior in habitat had a stronger effect on population density than movement behavior in matrix. Habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance may have a positive or negative effect on population density. The direction of both effects depends on two factors. First, when the boundary-crossing probability from habitat to matrix is high, population density may decline with increasing habitat fragmentation. Conversely, for species with a high matrix-to-habitat boundary-crossing probability, population density may increase with increasing habitat fragmentation. Second, the initial distribution of individuals across the landscape: we found that habitat fragmentation and inter-patch distance were positively correlated with population density when individuals were distributed across matrix and habitat at the beginning of our simulation experiments. The direction of these relationships changed to negative when individuals were initially distributed across habitat only. Our findings imply that the speed of the initial response of organisms to habitat fragmentation events may determine the direction of observed relationships between habitat fragmentation and population density. The time scale of post-fragmentation studies must, therefore, be adjusted to match the pace of post-fragmentation movement responses.

Explicit density-dependence implies regulation toward a central equilibrium point, whereas density-vagueness implies population change away from the two extremes of extinction and immense densities.

AB  - Primary neuron cultures are widely used in research due to the ease and usefulness of observing individual cells. Therefore, it is vital to understand how variations in culture conditions may affect neuron physiology. One potential variation for cultured neurons is a change in intracellular transport. As transport is necessary for the normal delivery of organelles, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, it is a logical indicator of a cell's physiology. We test the hypothesis that organelle transport may change with varying in vitro population densities, thus indicating a change in cellular physiology. Using a novel background subtraction imaging method we show that, at 5 days in vitro (DIV), transport of vesicular organelles in embryonic rat spinal cord neurons is positively correlated with cell density. When density increased 6.5-fold, the number of transported organelles increased 2.2 ± 0.3-fold. Intriguingly, this effect was not observable at 3-4 DIV. These results show a significant change in cellular physiology with a relatively small change in plating procedure; this indicates that cells appearing to be morphologically similar, and at the same DIV, may still suffer from a great degree of variability. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Theoretical models concerning how neighborhood contexts adversely influence juvenile antisocial behavior frequently focus on urban neighborhoods; however, previous studies comparing urban and rural areas on the prevalence of youth antisocial behavior have yielded mixed results. The current study uses longitudinal data on the offspring of a nationally representative sample of mothers (N = 4,886) in the US. There was no relation between density and mother-reported child conduct problems across ages 4-13 years, but youth living in areas of greater population density exhibited more youth self-reported delinquency across 10-17 years. Families often moved to counties with greater or lesser population density, but longitudinal analyses treating population density as a time-varying covariate did not support the hypothesis that living in densely populated counties influenced youth delinquency. Rather, the association between population density and delinquency appears to be due to unmeasured selection variables that differ between families who live in more or less densely populated counties.

AB  - UNITED NATIONS, New York – Twenty years ago, the international community gathered in Cairo, Egypt, to explore how the world was changing and how those changes were affecting the most vulnerable. At the 1994 meeting, the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), the world agreed that population issues – including voluntary family planning, maternal and child health, migration, and gender equality – are not just about counting people, but about making sure that every person counts. At the conference, 179 governments signed on to the ICPD Programme of Action, which recognizes that women, their rights and equality are global development priorities. The governments committed to: providing universal access to voluntary family planning, sexual and reproductive health services and rights; delivering gender equality and equal access to education; addressing the impacts of urbanization and migration; and supporting sustainable development. Today, the world is very different, transformed by the digital revolution and advances in medicine and human knowledge. But has it changed in the ways we hoped it would?

AB  - Badgers are facultatively social, forming large groups at high density. Group-living appears to have high reproductive costs for females, and may lead to increased levels of inbreeding. The extent of female competition for reproduction has been estimated from field data, but knowledge of male reproductive success and the extent of extra-group paternity remains limited. Combining field data with genetic data (16 microsatellite loci), we studied the mating system of 10 badger social groups across 14 years in a high-density population. From 923 badgers, including 425 cubs, we were able to assign maternity to 307 cubs, with both parents assigned to 199 cubs (47%) with 80% confidence, and 14% with 95% confidence. Age had a significant effect on the probability of reproduction, seemingly as a result of a deficit of individuals aged two years and greater than eight years attaining parentage. We estimate that approximately 30% of the female population successfully reproduced in any given year, with a similar proportion of the male population gaining paternity across the same area. While it was known there was a cost to female reproduction in high density populations, it appears that males suffer similar, but not greater, costs. Roughly half of assigned paternity was attributed to extra-group males, the majority of which were from neighbouring social groups. Few successful matings occurred between individuals born in the same social group (22%). The high rate of extra-group mating, previously unquantified, may help reduce inbreeding, potentially making philopatry a less costly strategy.

AB  - This paper presents research results on the dasymetric mapping method, the methodology adopted and a Dasymetric Population Density Map of the Northeastern Part of Poland. After studying certain published dasymetric mapping methods, a decision was made to start from the binary dasymetric procedure as described by Langdorf and Unwin (1994) in order to eliminate unpopulated regions. The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) database was utilized as ancillary data because the land cover pattern best reflects population density and provides useful georeferenced information for disaggregating census data. The first issued addressed was how is population distributed among CLC classes in Poland? Special attention was made to estimate the coefficients for the population ratio in land cover classes. Several different approaches were tested and eventually modified areal weighting was adopted. The dasymetric mapping method is based on the assumption that the ratio between the population density of two land cover categories is the same for any given commune.

AB  - The transport of flame surface density (FSD) in turbulent premixed flames has been studied using a database obtained from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). Three-dimensional freely propagating developing statistically planar turbulent premixed flames have been examined over a range of global Lewis numbers from 0.6 to 1.2. Simplified chemistry has been used and the emphasis is on the effects of Lewis number on FSD transport in the context of Reynolds-averaged closure modelling. Under the same initial conditions of turbulence, flames with low Lewis numbers are found to exhibit counter-gradient transport of FSD, whereas flames with higher Lewis numbers tend to exhibit gradient transport of FSD. Stronger heat release effects for lower Lewis number flames are found to lead to an increase in the positive (negative) value of the dilatation rate (normal strain rate) term in the FSD transport equation with decreasing Lewis number. The contribution of flame curvature to FSD transport is found to be influenced significantly by the effects of Lewis number on the curvature dependence of the magnitude of the reaction progress variable gradient, and on the combined reaction and normal diffusion components of displacement speed. The modelling of the various terms of the FSD transport equation has been analysed in detail and the performance of existing models is assessed with respect to the terms assembled from corresponding quantities extracted from DNS data. Based on this assessment, suitable models are identified which are able to address the effects of non-unity Lewis number on FSD transport, and new or modified models are suggested wherever necessary. ?? 2011 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - The statistical behavior of the propagation and curvature terms in the transport equation for flame surface density (FSD) is studied in the context of large eddy simulation (LES) of premixed combustion in the thin reaction zones regime. It is found that the propagation term is strongly influenced by curvature effects on displacement speed, and it is shown that the propagation term can be closed exactly without any additional modelling provided that the surface averaged displacement speed is accurately represented. The FSD curvature term is decomposed into resolved and subgrid contributions and three different model expressions for the resolved curvature term are studied. It is shown that the choice of expression for the resolved curvature term affects the modelling of the subgrid curvature term. This is important since the treatment of the subgrid curvature term involves the largest modelling uncertainties. Following this, it is argued that the most preferable expression for the resolved curvature term is the one which allows for the smallest subgrid contribution and which captures the correct trend of the complete LES-filtered curvature term. Predictions of existing models for the subgrid curvature term are assessed in comparison to values obtained from filtered direct numerical simulation data. It is demonstrated that the local curvature dependence of the LES surface averaged displacement speed plays a significant role in the modelling of both the curvature and propagation terms. A model is proposed which explicitly accounts for this dependence. (C) 2007 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - The concept of Functional Urban Regions (FURs), also called Metropolitan Regions (MRs), is not simple. It is clear, though, that they are not simply a combination of adjacent municipalities or areas. Different methods can be used for their definition. However, especially in developing countries, the application of some methods is not possible, due to the unavailability of detailed data. Alternative approaches have been developed based on spatial analysis methods and using variables extracted from available data. The objective of this study is to compare the results of two spatial analysis methods exploring two variables: population density and an indicator of transport infrastructure supply. The first method regards Exploratory Spatial Data Analyses tools, which define uniform regions based on specific variables. The second method used the same variables and the spatial analysis technique available in the computer program SKATER - Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal. Assuming that those classifications of regions with similar characteristics can be used for identifying potential FURs, the results of all analyses were compared with one another and with the 'official' MR. A combined approach was also considered for comparison, but none of the results match the existing MR boundaries, what challenges the official definitions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

(2) Much work on this phenomenon has been restricted to single-species considerations, such as the relationship with population regulation.

This is related to the question of how commonly interspecific competition occurs in nature. (4) Our results, for a group of four species of helicid land snails, show that while negative size-density associations are indeed found in single-species colonies, mixed colonies appear not to exhibit such associations, despite the increased number of comparisons that can be made and hence the increased chance of detecting them.

AB  - Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) is home to a low-density black bear (Ursus americanus)population that exists at >2,400m with a very limited growing season. A previous study (1984–1991) found bear densities among the lowest reported (1.37–1.52 bears/100 km2). Because of con- cerns of viability of this small population, we assessed popu- lation size and density of black bears from 2003 to 2006 to determine the current status of RMNP’s bear population.We used three approaches to estimate population size and density: (1) minimum number known, (2) occupancy modeling, and (3) catch per unit effort (CPUE). We used information from capture and remote-triggered cameras, as well as visitor infor- mation, to derive a minimum known population estimate of 20–24 individuals and a median density estimate of 1.35 bears/100 km2. Bear occupancy was estimated at 0.46 (SE0 0.11), with occupancy positively influenced by lodgepole pine stands, non-vegetated areas, and patch density but negatively influenced by mixed conifer stands. We combined the occu- pancy estimate with mean home-range size and overlap for bears in RMNP to derive a density estimate of 1.44 bears/ 100 km2.We also related CPUE to density estimates for eight low-density black bear populations to estimate density in RMNP; this estimate (1.03 bears/100 km2) was comparable to the occupancy estimate and suggests that this approach may be useful for future population monitoring. The use of corrob- orative techniques for assessing population size of a low- density black bear population was effective and should be considered for similar low-density wildlife populations.

AB  - Societies, virtually by definition, are in the business of social reproduction. They maintain institutional forms and cultural patterns more or less intact, though not of course unchanged, as their individual members age and die and the young are acculturated and assume adult roles. Social reproduction also takes place at the family level2014through the social and biological processes entailed in family succession2014 but there the outcomes owe much more to fortuity, to the luck of the draw. Nonetheless, families become adept at doing the best they can with whatever hands they are dealt2014if need be bending the rules, hedging, bluffing, and coercing. How they do so is highly contingent on each society's circumstances and cultural repertoires, but traditionally marriage decisions offered the principal opportunities and held the major potential risks. The case study of family marriage strategies in a village of the French Pyrenees by Pierre Bourdieu, excerpted below, gives an exceptionally lucid and illuminating dissection of this domain of life2014as it had persisted perhaps for centuries and into the 1950s and 1960s. Pierre Bourdieu was born in 1930 in a Béarn village of the Atlantic Pyrenees like that described. He held an appointment at the University of Algiers in the 1950s, during the years of colonial conflict leading up to independence, and his early research was on Algeria. From 1964 he taught at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales and later also at the Collège de France as professor of sociology (succeeding Raymond Aron), and became one of France's most prominent public intellectuals2014exercising an influence that would be virtually unknown among English-speaking sociologists. His major interests, in some respects prefigured in the present study, concerned aspects of cultural reproduction, particularly how educational systems reproduce class and privilege. His major works include Distinction (1979), The Logic of Practice (1980), and The Rules of Art (1992). He died in January 2002 at the age of 71. The case study excerpted below was published as "Les stratégies matrimoniales dans le système de reproduction,"Annales: Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations (Paris), vol. 27, no. 4/5 (1972).

AB  - The relative effects of resource availability and partitioning on animal population density are unresolved yet central to ecology and conservation. Species-depauperate islands offer an intriguing test case. Across 643 lizard populations from around the world, local abundances are one order of magnitude higher on islands than on mainlands, even when controlled for resource availability. On mainlands, predator and competitor richness only weakly correlate with lizard densities. On islands, sharp reductions in predator and competitor richness are the dominant drivers of lizard abundance. Our results demonstrate the dramatic effect insularity has on the interplay between biotic and abiotic control of animal abundances and the heightened sensitivity of island communities to species' losses and gains.

Mata do Para so, the largest fragment of this biome in Vicosa, Minas Gerais, comprises an area of 384.5 ha, whose primate population is represented by Callicebus nigrifrons (Spix, 1823), known by titi monkey, and Callithrix sp., denominated marmosets. The present study aimed at estimating the density and population size of these species, as well as at determining their abundance in the area. Five linear 1 km transects, placed in a parallel fashion in a representative portion of the forest, were covered by following the premises of the methodology Distance for linear transects. The data were collected from August 2004 to February 2006, with 70 samplings, totaling 82.7km being sampled, with 24 primate detections. A density of 4.51 groups/km(2) for Callicebus nigrifrons and 7.45 groups/km(2) for Callithrix sp was obtained. Callicebus nigrifrons' abundance corresponded to 1.43 individuals/10 km sampled, and the abundance of Callithrix sp. corresponded to 1.17 individuals/10 km sampled. The population size of Callicebus nigrifrons was estimated in 28 individuals and for Callithrix sp., in 86 individuals. This result corroborates the need for further research to detect fluctuations along time, aiming to preserve and manage these species.

AB  - The ethanol-producing bacterium Zymomonas mobilis is of great interest from a bioenergetic perspective because, although it has a very high respiratory capacity, the respiratory system does not appear to be primarily required for energy conservation. To investigate the regulation of respiratory genes and function of electron transport branches in Z. mobilis, several mutants of the common wild-type strain Zm6 (ATCC 29191) were constructed and analyzed. Mutant strains with a chloramphenicol-resistance determinant inserted in the genes encoding the cytochrome b subunit of the bc (1) complex (Zm6-cytB), subunit II of the cytochrome bd terminal oxidase (Zm6-cydB), and in the catalase gene (Zm6-kat) were constructed. The cytB and cydB mutants had low respiration capacity when cultivated anaerobically. Zm6-cydB lacked the cytochrome d absorbance at 630nm, while Zm6-cytB had very low spectral signals of all cytochromes and low catalase activity. However, under aerobic growth conditions, the respiration capacity of the mutant cells was comparable to that of the parent strain. The catalase mutation did not affect aerobic growth, but rendered cells sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Cytochrome c peroxidase activity could not be detected. An upregulation of several thiol-dependent oxidative stress-protective systems was observed in an aerobically growing ndh mutant deficient in type II NADH dehydrogenase (Zm6-ndh). It is concluded that the electron transport chain in Z. mobilis contains at least two electron pathways to oxygen and that one of its functions might be to prevent endogenous oxidative stress.

AB  - The relationship between abundance and body size is the subject of considerable debate in ecology. Here we present new data on the relationship between population density and body mass for flightless birds. Unlike flying birds, flightless birds (and mammals) show a strong negative relationship between population density and body mass. Density decreases as the -1.40 power of body mass, which is significantly steeper than in flying birds. This difference is mainly due to a real absence of small species with low population densities in flightless birds. Small populations of small-bodied species may not be able to persist unless sustained by immigration. The high mobility of flying birds may allow even small local populations of small-bodied species to persist through supply of immigrants, and thus can explain the weak relationship between abundance and body size for this group compared to that of flightless birds (and mammals).

AB  - An understanding of the extent to which marine populations are connected by larval dispersal is vital, both to comprehend past impacts and future prospects for sustaining biodiversity. Marine popu- lations and their supporting ecosystems are now subject to a multitude of threats, most notably overharvesting, pollution, and climate change (Hixon et al., 2001; Jackson et al., 2001; Hutchings and Reynolds, 2004; Kappel, 2005; Lotze et al., 2006). The intensity and scale of anthropogenic impacts in the worlds ocean have increased dramatically during the industrial age (Jackson et al., 2001; Lotze et al., 2006), and these impacts are combining to acceler- ate the loss and fragmentation of important coastal marine habitats, including man- groves (Ellison and Farnsworth, 1996; Alongi, 2002), seagrasses (Duarte, 2002; Orth et al., 2006), kelp forests (Dayton et al., 1998; Steneck et al., 2002), and coral reefs (McClanahan, 2002; Gardiner et al., 2003; Hughes, et al., 2003; Aronson and Precht, 2006). The increasing risk of extinction in the sea is widely acknowledged (Roberts and Hawkins, 1999; Powles et al., 2000; Dulvy et al., 2003; Kappel, 2005; Reynolds et al., 2005), and the conservation of marine biodiversity has become a high priority for researchers and managers alike.

AB  - Population size and trends of large low-density predators, like lions (Panthera leo), are difficult to monitor, a situation that is exacerbated in a semi-arid and vast area like the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (KTP, 36000 km), South Africa/Botswana, where they occur at low densities. Mark-resighting studies conducted in 1976, and again in 1996, in the lower rainfall south African region of this transfrontier park (former Kalahari Gemsbok National Park) and adjoining area in the former Gemsbok National Park, Botswana 3000km) indicated that lions occurred at very low densities (< lion/100km). For affective conservation of lions in the KTP, and to evaluate the effect of persistent but low intensity boundary persecution, reliable estimates of population size and trends were required. Furthermore the adjoining area in the former GNP had never been surveyed (+ 23000 km). By adapting a technique whereby the correlation between spoor density (an indirect measure), and true density in various representative study areas, it was possible to extrapolate a density estimate for the entire park. True densities were determined by acquiring thorough knowledge of the population in each study area. This was done through a combination of marking individuals, radio-telemetry, ground observations, and attracting lions to call up stations. Spoor density was determined through intensive spoor transects, conducted within the study areas (1382+215 km/study area). A total of 4078 km were conducted for comparative purposes outside the study areas.

AB  - Physical condition in a living at high density (120 individuals/1000 ha of forest area) red deer Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758 population was studied by determining: dressed body weight, kidney fat index (KFI) and amount of visceral fat in 628 animals. Antler weights were also considered as condition index of stags. The mean body weight of calves of both sexes was identical, ie 38.0 kg, that of hinds fluctuated from 57.8 to 75.1 kg, stags - from 63.2 to 132.4 kg depending upon age. The KFI value for female and male calves, hinds, and stags at various age amounted respectively to: 1.54, 1.36, 1.60-1.76, and 1.17-2.69. Per cent of individuals with great amount of visceral fat amounted: in female calves - to 39.4, in male calves - 33.3, in hinds - 47.6-66.7, and in stags - 20.0-100.0% depending upon age. Maximum weight of antlers was 4.2 kg. Despite high population density animals indicated generally good physical condition. Except that the condition of calves of both sexes has been maintained at a similar level, what evidenced an inferior condition of males during their growth. Males in contrast to females, reveal serious decline of condition following the rut, during autumn and winter. It was related to stag age and most marked in the animals of the oldest age-classes (no less than by 40.

AB  - We investigated growth and determinants of adult female body size in brown bears (Ursus arctos) in 2 study areas in Sweden. Scandinavian female brown bears reached 90% of their asymptotic size at 4.1-4.7 years. Four factors were considered in our analysis of the determinants of adult female size: annual food conditions, population density, multilocus heterozygosity, and yearling body size. Our results suggest that individual body size variation of female brown bears is negatively related to density-dependent factors and positively correlated to density-independent fluctuations in the environment. Density-dependent factors may operate by increasing competition for food, resulting in a decrease in body size. Food resources for brown bears in Sweden fluctuate annually in the boreal forest and influence individual body size. Multilocus heterozygosity and yearling body size were not important in explaining adult size, because initially smaller individuals show compensatory growth when experiencing good food conditions. ¬© 2006 American Society of Mammalogists.

AB  - Theory predicts that organisms living in heterogeneous environments will exhibit phenotypic plasticity. One trait that may be particularly important in this context is the clutch or brood size because it is simultaneously a maternal and offspring characteristic. In this paper, I test the hypothesis that the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis, adjusts brood size, in part, in anticipation of the reproductive environment of its adult offspring. N. orbicollis use a small vertebrate carcass as a food resource for their young. Both parents provide parental care and actively regulate brood size through filial cannibalism. The result is a positive correlation between brood size and carcass size. Adult body size is an important determinant of reproductive success for both sexes, but only at higher population densities. I test three predictions generated by the hypothesis that beetles adjust brood size in response to population density. First, average adult body size should vary positively with population density. Second, brood size on a given-sized carcass should be larger (producing more but smaller young) in low-density populations than in high-density populations. Third, females should respond adaptively to changes in local population density by producing larger broods when population density is low and small broods when population density is high. All three predictions were supported using a combination of field and laboratory experiments. These results (1) show that brood size is a phenotypically plastic trait and (2) support the idea that brood size decisions are an intergenerational phenomenon that varies with the anticipated competitive environment of the offspring.

AB  - The population size, age-class structure, and movement of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana (L.) (Dictyoptera: Blattidae), were studied in three sewers in Penang, Malaysia, from September 2008 to October 2009. Eighteen to 20 glass-jar traps (two per manhole) were deployed for a 24-h period during each sampling occasion at each sewer. Adults and nymphs were active throughout the study period, with an average monthly trap catch of 57-97 adults and 79-99 nymphs. The mean proportions of adults and nymphs at the three sewers ranged from 0.47 to 0.57. Of the 2177 male and 2717 female cockroaches marked and released over the three sewers, recapture rates were 29.4-45.8 and 30.8-47.0%, respectively. The proportion of marked males and females did not differ significantly from the proportion of recaptured marked males and females. However, the mean number of times a marked female was recaptured was significantly greater than that of males. Of the 783 males and 1,030 females that were marked and recaptured, 19.4 and 24.7%, respectively, had moved between manholes, and significantly more females than males moved between manholes. Of the 406 recaptured marked adults that moved between manholes, 90.4% moved a distance of 2-20 m from their initial release site; one male moved 192 m, the longest distance recorded. Trap catch on each sampling occasion was positively correlated with daily mean temperature. The number of cockroach movements between manholes also was correlated with the mean daily minimum temperature.

AB  - The unresolved difficulties associated with defining and measuring population density strictly circumscribe the scope and nature of the conclusions that can be properly derived from differentials in man:land ratios. Any conclusions about human density will have meaning only to the extent that they are based on a recognition that this density must be viewed in both static and dynamic terms and that it cannot be isolated in analysis, from either the social and cultural setting, the demographic characteristics of the population, or the broader processes of social change within the society. In and of itself, the familiar man:land ratio says more about area than it does about either the human experience of density or the relation of population to resources. This ratio is therefore essentially meaningless as an indicator of comparative conditions of life among different countries and different geographic regions. The mere fact of having a relatively low average population density thus, does not automatically entitle a nation to complacency about its ability to adjust readily to future population change, either in terms of growth in numbers or in the geographic location of its people.

AB  - Globally, new cases of syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis total 340 million each year. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other reproductive tract infections (RTIs) are major causes of severe illness, infertility, obstetric complications, and infant illness. They may also increase transmission of HIV. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are 50 to 300 percent more prevalent among women than among men. Correctly diagnosing and treating RTIs in women is thus a public health imperative. However, reaching this goal usually requires a clinic visit and a pelvic examination, which may deter some women. Population Council researchers investigated the acceptability and feasibility of home-based self-sampling for STIs in Brazil and South Africa. In South Africa, researchers also looked at the validity of using self-sampling in a clinic setting to diagnose RTIs.

AB  - With the purpose of obtaining a theoretical basis on which existing experimental data on the density effect upon reproduction may be interpreted consistently, a mathematical analysis has been developed from the well-known logistic growth equation.  consideration has first been given to the growth process occurring in the interval of one generation time, resulting in mathematical relations for the effects of initial population density No on (1) the apparent rate of reproduction, R, and (2) the total number of living individuals, P, to be found at the end of the generation.  These are given in equations (4) and (7), respectively.  Experimental checks on these equations have been made, using the data which had been presented by Utida (1941a) on an experimental population of the azuki bean weevil, although data from some other insect populations have also been used to confirm equation (4).  Satisfactory agreements of these equations with the corresponding experimental data are shown graphically in Figures 2, 3, 3, and 4.  One of the interesting facts thereby revealed is the clear evidence of a density of parent population at which the total population reaches a maximum value.  Experimental proof of the existence of such an optimum density in population growth had previously been given by the populations of several insect species, but its theoretical foundation has remained obscure.  Next, equation (7) has been modified to give a mathematical relation for describing the population changes from generation to generation.  This relation is given in equation (10).  By solving this analytically, if possible, or numerically, it has been shown that, theoretically, population changes in successive generations should follow one of the various modes indicated in Table I.  Some experimental data that meet this theoretical requirement have been mentioned.  Finally, employing a relation which has recently been derived by Fujita between the volume of environment and the Pearl-Verhulst coefficient, the logistic equation (3) has bene transformed into equation (18), and it has been demonstrated that this equation is also well fitted by the experimental data on the azuki bean weevil population (Utida 1942), in which the density effect on reproduction was studied by changing the volume of the container.  The agreements thus obtained are found in Figures 7 and 8.

AB  - Background Sustainable urban development is an important objective in many cities and countries. Reduction of (the growth in) urban road traffic is generally accepted as an integrated part of sustainable urban development. There is seemingly a relatively widespread consensus on which means are needed in order reduce urban car traffic volumes (physical and fiscal constraints on road traffic, improvements for public transport, walking and cycling, transport reducing spatial planning) (Næss 2001, European Commission 2001, Owens 1995). Many of these mechanisms are not employed to full advantage. On the contrary, in Norway urban road system capacity is undergoing expansion, the pace of development of public transport facilities are not keeping up with improvements in car traffic facilities, development of infrastructure for walking an bicycling is developing slowly, urban sprawl and wrong location of operations are allowed, and car use is rising too. Research question Our research question is: How and why are planners making plans and politicians adopting them, that according to generally accepted scientific understanding of the correlations between urban development (land use development and development of transport systems) and growth in urban car traffic volumes, result in more urban car traffic despite clear aspirations to reduce urban car traffic growth? Methodology I an initiative study, based on literature reviews and case studies, we defined a number of possible explanations or hypothesis that can explain this (Tennøy 2004a); - Conflicting objectives and values - The politicians rationality and the rationality of politics - Lobbying - Institutional and organisational factors - The planners rationality and the rationality of planning - Knowledge and lack of knowledge among important actors - Disagreement/uncertainty on effects of various means - Focus in planning - Use of transport models in urban planning In order to test these hypothesis, and to achieve a deeper understanding, two in depth case studies were carried out, studying how the use of large transport models influences the land use and transport planning and its results (Tennøy 2004b). Later, two surveys were carried out, among politicians and one among land use planners and transport planners, focusing on how these groups see objectives, values and the usefulness and effects of various means for reducing urban road transport (Tennøy 2007, 2005). The ETC paper will discuss explanations to the research questions based on findings in these studies, supplemented by ongoing analysis of in depth interviews with 12 politicians and 18 planning professionals.

These investigations were some of the first of their kind in South Asia. They probed the level of awareness of domestic violence among obstetrician/gynecologists (OB/GYNs) in Karachi, Pakistan, and of OB/ GYNs, assistant nurse midwives, and traditional birth attendants in Kathmandu, Nepal. Postpartum women in Karachi and Kathmandu were surveyed to augment knowledge about the scope, context, and consequences of violence faced by pregnant women. In a separate study, men in Karachi were interviewed about domestic violence. Although preliminary and limited to two urban areas, the studies suggest a high level of physical abuse during pregnancy and provide some empirical basis for developing realistic interventions to protect the lives of women and their children.

AB  - The influence of turbulent Reynolds number Ret on the statistical behaviour and modelling of flame surface density (FSD) transport has been analysed using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of freely propagating turbulent premixed flames with values of Ret ranging from 20 to 100. The variation of Ret is brought about by modifying the Damkohler and Karlovitz numbers independently of each other. The findings indicate that the qualitative behaviour of the various terms of the FSD transport equation remains unaffected by the changes in turbulent Reynolds number, but their relative contributions to the transport of FSD are affected to some extent. The effects of turbulent Reynolds number on the modelling of the turbulent transport term, the tangential strain rate term and the combined propagation and curvature terms are addressed in detail. It is demonstrated that model parameters for the turbulent transport and tangential strain rate term exhibit turbulent Reynolds number dependence for small values of Ret and assume asymptotic values for Ret P 50. By contrast, the model parameters for the combined propagation and curvature term are found to be insensitive to the variation of turbulent Reynolds number. Existing models for the turbulent transport term and the tangential strain rate term are modified to account for the observed turbulent Reynolds number dependence. ?? 2012 The Combustion Institute.

AB  - We investigated movement patterns in a high-density population of Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) to explore how the costs and benefits of dispersal and other forms of movement differed among individuals in the population. We analyzed a 17-year data set comprising 5,255 trapping events for members of a population of Eurasian badgers at Wytham Woods, Oxford, United Kingdom. For a subset of badgers with a sufficient trapping history, we were able to identify dispersal events. Permanent dispersal was not common. Of 267 badgers 1st trapped as young and caught on a minimum of 4 occasions spanning 400 days or more, the majority (75.8%) were never captured at more than 2 social groups. Only 51 (19.1%) of these animals satisfied our definition of dispersal; 96 (35.8%) were never captured outside of their natal social group. Male badgers moved between groups more than did females and accumulated more wounds in the process. Dispersing males tended to move to larger groups and to groups with a preponderance of females, but dispersal rate did not change as the density of the population increased. However, evidence of extraterritorial matings suggests that inbreeding may be alleviated without dispersal. We consider the implications of these findings for the mating system and social behavior of the badger. ¬© 2008 American Society of Mammalogists.

Population density is reported to be inversely related to home range size, but the relationship may be confounded with body weight. We used multiple regression to examine the relationship between population density, body weight, and minimum convex polygon home range size for seven feral hog populations. We found that both population density and bodyweight were significant in predicting home range size. Future research on density - home range relationships should consider body weight as an important covariate.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between population growth, agricultural production, and urban development. Ongoing debate in the literature regarding the relationship between population and economic development is restricted by the limited availability of time series data and the difficulty of evaluating causality using cross-sectional data. This analysis uses the special case of Jordan with its massive refugee flows to evaluate the influence of a sudden and exogenous change in population in urban areas on the intensification of agricultural production. Spearman Rank Order correlations are calculated from time series data to show that the districts which experienced the most rapid population growth and increases in population density also exhibited the largest increases in agricultural intensity. Cross-sectional analysis in which measures of agricultural intensification were predicted by population density and urbanization factors reveals a significant interaction between density and urban centrality, where ‘centrality’ is an indicator of the accessibility of urban goods to rural communities. The results suggest that population density has a strongly positive effect on agricultural intensity in areas with few urban goods and services available, whereas the influence of population density on agricultural intensity is substantially reduced in areas with a greater diversity of urban goods and services.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Suicide rates among men have increased in Scotland while falling in neighbouring countries. A national suicide prevention strategy has been produced. Previous work found that some rural areas of Scotland had higher than average rates of male suicide and undetermined deaths. This article describes the association between population density and suicide and undetermined death rates in Scotland. METHODS: Anonymised information on deaths from suicide and undetermined cause in Scotland were obtained from the General Registrar Office for 1981-1999, including information on postcode sector. Each postcode sector was assigned a deprivation and population density score. Loglinear models were used to examine the effects of time period (grouped into four periods), deprivation quintiles, population density (grouped into four categories) and their interactions in each sex in three age groups. A significance level of 5% was used throughout. Adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were based on models that included only significant factors and interactions. RESULTS: In men, there were higher rate ratios in the most densely populated and least densely populated quartiles, with intermediate rate ratios in other areas. There was no association with population density in women aged less than 25 years, a similar pattern to men in 25-44 year old women, and lower rates in rural areas in older women. Higher levels of deprivation were associated with higher rate ratios of suicide in both sexes and all age groups. Rate ratios over time increased in younger men and women, remained stable in older men, and declined in older women. CONCLUSIONS: Deprivation is associated with higher rates of suicide and undetermined deaths at all levels of population density and in all age groups. The highest rates of suicide among men are in the most and least densely populated areas, after adjusting for deprivation. The effect is different among women, with no effect among younger women, and lower rates among older women in areas with lower population density.

AB  - With decreased illegal hunting and better habitat conservation, the Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) population grew from an estimated 25-50 animals in the late 1940s to approximately 200 animals on Big Pine and No Name keys, Florida, USA, by 1971, the last official survey. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) trend data indicate that the deer population continued to increase after 1971; however, current deer density estimates are necessary for the proposed reclassification of the Key deer from endangered to threatened. Our study objectives were to (1) obtain current population estimates of Florida Key deer and compare these to historical estimates, (2) evaluate survey methods (USFWS mortality and deer counts) in detecting changes in population trends, and (3) outline a protocol for future monitoring. Road counts (n = 889) were conducted from January 1971 to December 1971 and January 1976 to December 2001 on Big Pine and No Name keys. From mark-recapture data, we estimated that the Key deer population on these 2 islands increased by 240% between 1971 and 2001 (2001 estimate: 453-517 deer). Trend data indicated that annual deer mortality was a function of deer density or population size (r(s) = 0.743). We compared the annual finite rate of increase (R) from USFWS annual deer counts and mortality data (R = 1.053-1.065) to mark-recapture studies (R = 1.038) and found them to be similar (P = 0.66-0.67). This similarity suggests that all 3 methods (USFWS deer counts and mortality data, and mark-recapture data) can be used to monitor changes in Key deer density.

AB  - 1. The relationship between body size (W), number of species, and population density (D) was investigated in tropical intertidal communities on the Pacific coast of Panama to address two main questions: (i) does an inverse relationship between body size and average population density like that observed in temperate Chilean rocky intertidal habitats occur in other intertidal communities at other latitudes? and (ii) to what extent does the body size-density relationship depend on variation in predation in these habitats? 2. Like their temperate counterparts, intertidal communities in Panama exhibit a lognormal body size distribution: most species are of intermediate size, with smaller numbers of both smaller and larger species. Population abundances of Panamanian species are also log-normally distributed. However, in sharp contrast to the pattern observed in temperate communities, body size of Panamanian species is not correlated with average or maximum population density. 3. Densities of the most abundant species, those that fall on the upper boundary of the body size-density distribution, also were not significantly correlated with body size. The 'predicted' upper boundary slope (UBS), obtained from combining the lognormal distributions of body sizes and of population abundances, was much more negative than the observed UBS. 4. Experimental exclusion of a morphologically diverse and species-rich (> 22 species) assemblage of subtidal fishes that forage on intertidal organisms led to a weak but significant negative association between body size and density. A steep negative D-W relationship was observed fora subset of these species at sites in Costa Pica, where fish predation is low, suggesting that the differences in the body size-density patterns represent regional rather than latitudinal trends. 5. The ability of fishes to suppress the population density scaling is probably linked to the low recruitment of tropical benthic invertebrate species and the 'energy-independence' of these fishes from the intertidal zone. This predator guild can have great impact on all intertidal invertebrates and yet they might be little affected by intertidal prey as they also feed and spend most of the time subtidally.

AB  - Since the 1950s, the government of Vietnam has established a vast network of primary health facilities. In addition to improving the health of individuals, this system aims to promote healthcare equity throughout the country. Services include comprehensive prenatal care and delivery services, care throughout early childhood, and services for basic health needs throughout a person's life. Evidence suggests that these services have lowered infant and child mortality rates and improved life expectancy at all ages. However, recent research by the Population Council suggests that progress has been more rapid among the ethnic majority population than among ethnic minority groups in Vietnam. The country's early health initiatives for the there are more than 50 in Vietnam-from the majority of Vietnamese. Evidence from national surveys and other studies indicates that these minority groups are generally poorer than the Kinh majority. Social indicators, such as levels of educational attainment, show that minorities are disadvantaged. Moreover, studies of health indicators demonstrate that minorities have higher morbidity and mortality rates than Kinh of equivalent ages. Population Council researchers Bussarawan Teerawichitchainan and James F. Phillips used data from the 2001-2002 Vietnam National Health Survey (VNHS) to assess parental recall of illness among their children under age 5 and analyze details of parents' care-seeking once they reported that their children were self-care. At the second visit the survey takers used the diaries to prompt discussions about the illnesses that had occurred in the past month. In the survey, respiratory infection and diarrhea-two of the biggest killers of children under age 5-were distinguished from other childhood illnesses. These maladies accounted for 31 and 11 percent respectively of all reported illnesses among under-5 children. (excerpt)

AB  - In studying the complex determinants of human fertility, social scien- tists have given little attention to population density, although reproduction has been shown to be density-dependent for a wide variety of other species. Using fixed effects models on the time series of 145 countries and controlling for key social and economic variables, we find a consistent and significant negative relationship be- tween human fertility and population density. Moreover, we find that individual fertility preferences also decline with population density. These findings suggest that population density should be included as a variable in future studies of fertility determinants.

AB  - Trapping is commonly used in various pest insect monitoring programs as well as in many ecological field studies. Despite this, the interpretation of trap counts is challenging. Traps are effective at providing relative counts that enable comparisons but are poor at delivering information on the absolute population size. Making better use of trap data is impeded by the lack of a consistent underlying theoretical model. In this paper, we aim to overcome current limitations of trapping methods used in ecological studies through developing a theoretical and methodological framework that enables a direct estimate of populations from trap counts. We regard insect movement as stochastic Brownian motion and use two different mathematical approaches accordingly. We first use individual-based modelling to reproduce trap catch patterns and study the effect of individual movement on observed catch patterns. We then consider a 'mean-field' diffusion model and show that it is capable of revealing the generic relationship between trap catches and population density. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Population aging was one of the most distinctive events of the 20th century and will remain important throughout the 21st century. Initially, a phenomenon of more developed countries, the process has recently become apparent in much of the developing world as well. The shift in age structure associated with population aging has a profound impact on a broad range of economic, political, and social conditions. This report provides an overview of the world population aging process, focusing on five relevant public policy issues. In dealing with the issues, the report notes the course of the aging process, which has not been the same in all countries. There has been considerable variation in timing, levels, and patterns. The report's assessment of the general trends is disaggregated into development regions and major geographic areas whenever possible. There are five chapters: (1) "Demographic Determinants of Population Ageing" examines the worldwide decline in fertility and mortality that underlies population aging; (2) "The Magnitude and Speed of Population Ageing" explores regional differences in the progression of the aging process through analysis of the percentages and growth rates of the older groups of the population; (3) "The Changing Balance between Age Groups" highlights, from various perspectives, the changes in the relative size of the older and younger groups of the population; (4) "A Demographic Profile of the Older Population" draws attention to two important features of the aging process: the progressive aging of the older population itself and its feminization; and (5) "The Socio-Economic Characteristics of the Older Population" focuses on two dimensions that can greatly affect the well-being of older individuals: labor force participation and literacy.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have reached population densities in the agricultural Midwest that would not have been predicted 20-30 years ago.  To help explain this phenomenon, we inventoried and analyzed potential deer habitat in Illinois, using classified satellite imagery and a proximity –based habitat model.  Statewide prehunt deer densities (ca 1992) were estimated at 4-5 deer per km2 of total area and 30-37 deer per km2 of forest based on population reconstruction and modeling.  Habitat suitability indices explained 81% of the variation in deer population densities at the county level.  The amount and distribution of deer habitat in Illinois was primarily dependent on intensity of agricultural land use, which in turn was dictated by soil productivity and terrain.  We found no evidence that relative use of available habitat at the county level was adversely affected either by habitat fragmentation or human presence on the landscape.

AB  - The exponential density function has been used widely to describe and compare the patterning of urban population. In this article it is argued that the exponent within the function can be biassed by the misidentification of the CBD and of the centroids of census tracts. Using a least-squares method it is shown that such misspecification (of the location of the CBD) leads to an underestimation of the gradient, and shows that the magnitude of the bias is itself related to the extent of the distance error by which the CBD is misidentified.

AB  - On 13 September 1994 in Cairo, after nine days of intense debate,\nthe International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)\nadopted a wide-ranging 20-year action plan that delegates and commentators\nhailed as opening a “new era in population”.\n\n\nUnderpinned by a commitment to human rights and gender equality, the\nCairo agreement called on countries to ensure reproductive health\nand rights for all as a critical contribution to sustainable development\nand the fight against poverty, which the ICPD saw as inseparable\nfrom addressing population concerns.\n\n\n“You have crafted a Programme of Action for the next 20 years, which\nstarts from the reality of the world we live in, and shows us a path\nto a better reality,” Dr. Nafis Sadik, UNFPA Executive Director and\nSecretary-General of the conference, told delegates at the closing\nsession. “The Programme contains highly specific goals and recommendations\nin the mutually reinforcing areas of infant and maternal mortality,\neducation, and reproductive health and family planning, but its effect\nwill be far widerranging than that. This Programme of Action has\nthe potential to the change the world.”\n\n\nTen years into the new era, it is time to take stock:\n\n\n* The ICPD Programme of Action provides a blueprint for actions in\npopulation and reproductive health that countries agree are essential\nto realizing global development goals including ending extreme poverty\nand hunger, empowering women, reducing maternal mortality, preserving\nthe environment and stemming the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In recent regional\nand global meetings and in practice, governments have strongly reaffirmed\ntheir commitment, based on experience, to utilize the Programme of\nAction as an indispensable strategy for improving people’s well-being\nand ensuring human rights.\n\n\n\n* Many developing countries have made great strides in putting the\nICPD’s recommendations into action, with a significant impact. Countries\nare working to integrate population factors with development plans,\nimprove the quality and reach of reproductive health programmes,\npromote women’s rights, meet the needs of young people and those\nin emergency situations, and strengthen HIV prevention efforts. Access\nto family planning continues to grow; 60 per cent of married couples\nin developing countries now use modern methods of contraception,\ncompared to 10-15 per cent in 1960.\n\n\n\n* Inadequate resources and persistent gaps in serving the poorest\npopulations are impeding progress, however, in meeting ongoing challenges\nincluding the continued spread of HIV/AIDS, especially among the\nyoung, unmet need for family planning, and high fertility and maternal\nmortality in the least-developed countries. Donors need to meet the\ncommitments made in Cairo and give due priority to reproductive health\nin anti-poverty development assistance plans, and programmes must\nbe scaled up and extended to realize the ICPD’s goal of comprehensive\nreproductive health care for all by 2015.\n\n\nPutting People at the Centre\n\n\nAs its name implied, the ICPD was based on the premise that population\nsize, growth and distribution are closely linked to prospects for\neconomic and social development, and that actions in one area reinforce\nactions in the other.\n\n\nThis premise had won increasing acceptance in the two decades since\nthe first World Population Conference in 1974, as population grew\nrapidly in developing regions and as more and more countries gained\nexperience with family planning programmes. By 1994, most developing\ncountries saw a need to address population concerns in order to promote\neconomic growth and improve people’s well-being.\n\nA WIDE MANDATE\n\n\nThe 1994 Conference was explicitly given a broader mandate on development\nissues than previous population conferences, reflecting the growing\nawareness that population, poverty, patterns of production and consumption\nand the environment are so closely interconnected that none of them\ncan be considered in isolation.\n\n—ICPD Programme of Action, para. 1.5\n\n\nA NEW APPROACH. But the Cairo conference radically changed the international\ncommunity’s approach to the interlinked challenges of population\nand development, putting human beings and human rights, rather than\npopulation numbers and growth rates, at the centre of the equation.\n\n\nAt the heart of this paradigm shift was the move away from a perception\nof population as essentially a macro-economic variable for planning\nand policy, to a rights-based approach in which the well-being of\nindividuals is key. The ICPD Programme of Action called for policies\nand programmes to take an integrated approach— linking population\naction to human development, women’s empowerment, gender equality,\nand the needs and rights of individuals, including young people.\n\n\nThe ICPD Programme of Action recognized that investing in people,\nin broadening their opportunities and enabling them to realize their\npotential as human beings, is the key to sustained economic growth\nand sustainable development, as well as to population levels that\nare in balance with the environment and available resources.\n\n\nAs part of this shift, the ICPD grounded family planning, once the\nmain focus of population policies and programmes, within a broader\nframework of reproductive health and rights, including family planning\nand sexual health. It recognized reproductive health as a human right\nfor all people throughout their life cycle, and urged countries to\nstrive for universal access to comprehensive reproductive health\nservices by 2015 (see Chapter 6).\n\n\nINDIVIDUAL CHOICE PROMOTES PROSPERITY. The ICPD consensus recognized\nthat enabling couples and individuals to freely determine the number,\ntiming and spacing of their children would speed progress towards\nsmaller families and slower population growth, contributing to economic\ngrowth and reducing poverty, at both the household and macro levels.\nConversely, it understood that not addressing needs and major gaps\nin reproductive health services would help perpetuate high fertility,\nhigh maternal mortality and rapid population growth, undermining\npoverty reduction prospects (see Chapter 2).\n\n\nWOMEN’S RIGHTS. Empowering women was recognized as an important end\nin itself, as well as a key to improving the quality of life of everyone.\nWithout the full and equal participation of women, there can be no\nsustainable human development. The Programme of Action stressed the\nimportance of reproductive rights to women’s autonomy, as a complement\nto education, economic empowerment and political participation (see\nChapter 5).\n\n\nImportant breakthroughs were made in facing up to urgent but sensitive\nchallenges including adolescents’ sexual health, HIV/AIDS and unsafe\nabortion. Unprecedented attention was given to underserved groups,\nincluding the rural poor, indigenous peoples, urban slum dwellers,\nand refugees and internally displaced people.\n\n\nPARTICIPATION AND PARTNERSHIP. The Cairo agreement also envisioned\na participatory and accountable development process, actively involving\nbeneficiaries to ensure that programmes and policy goals are linked\nwith personal realities, and to building broad partnerships between\ngovernments, international organizations and civil society.

AB  - Fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) populations in the southeastern United States are declining, with fragmentation of large mature forests believed to be the primary cause. Historically, demographics of midwestern fox squirrel or gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) populations have been applied to management of southeastern fox squirrels. However, fox squirrels rarely become abundant in southeastern forests, despite variations in habitat quality. Previous research has reported on low density populations in the Southeast, but the effects of changing land use patterns on population demographics remain untested. We studied the demographics of a stable high density population of southern fox squirrels (S. n. niger) on Spring Island, South Carolina. Squirrel density (75.8 squirrels/km(2)), as estimated by the mark-resight method was the highest reported for fox squirrels in the Southeast. Mean annual survival rate was 62%, with automobiles causing 31% of squirrel deaths. Seasonal weights (992 g-1150 g), age structure (39% juvenile and 61% subadult or adult) and evidence of year round breeding suggest the population was healthy despite concurrent residential development of the island. Although individual home ranges were smaller (2.13 ha for females during late summer to 15.08 ha for males during early summer) than previously reported, we observed no resource related sexual segregation or intolerance among individuals. We believed the characteristics of this unique population were directly related to the sustainable availability of a diversity of fox squirrel foods. These findings suggest that population demographics of fox squirrels might differ greatly among habitats, even within similar geographic locations and the same subspecies. Therefore, managers should recognize that southern fox squirrel populations can thrive in forests with residential development when cover and food resources are abundant and sustainable.

AB  - This paper examines how climate change policy can impact on competition, prices and profitability in the air transport industry. It begins with an outline of the climate change policies that have been suggested, and it gives particular attention to the inclusion of air transport in an emissions trading scheme (ETS).This is likely to prove an important policy direction, with the EU, Australia and New Zealand all planning to include air transport in their ETSs. The scope for airlines to reduce their emissions intensity in the short run and long run is examined- it is concluded that the scope in the short run is quite limited. After this, the application of the emissions trading schemes of the EU, Australia and New Zealand to air transport is discussed, and the possible impacts on air fares are assessed. Allowance is made for the cost of permits for both direct and indirect emissions. The impacts of climate change policies, such as carbon taxes or requirements to purchase emissions permits, on airline competition, prices and profitability are analysed next. Impacts differ according to market structure- whether airline city pair markets are competitive, monopolistic or oligopolistic. They also depend on the time scale- airlines are unlikely to be able to pass on the full cost of their permits to their passengers in the short run, though in the long run, it is likely that airlines will exit from some city pairs, and this will enable to remaining airlines to raise their fares and restore their profitability. This may not occur in markets constrained by airport slots or capacity limits imposed in air services agreements on international routes, though the airlines problems are not likely to be as severe as has been suggested. If permits are provided free of charge to airlines, fares should still rise in the long run, assuming that airlines are profit maximisers and factor in the opportunity cost of the permits they obtain free. However even if airlines do this, there can be cases where fares do not rise by as much as they would if permits have to be purchased, because the operation of the ETS may discourage exit from markets. If airlines do not act as profit maximisers, air fare increases will be limited, and airlines will have the scope to cross subsidise less profitable routes. The limited evidence on airlines use of free inputs (such as airport slots) is examined to obtain insights into whether airlines do indeed maximise their profits- this evidence is inconclusive. Finally the application of an ETS to international air transport is considered this can give rise to issues of competitive non-neutrality, even when permits are sold.

AB  - 1. We critically evaluated the Energetic Equivalence Rule (EER) with regard to its underlying theoretical framework, its dependence of a particular relationship between population density and body size, and the way it is calculated. 2. We found it to be theoretically incorrect, not supported by empirical data on maximum population density and body size relationships, and that its calculation is misleading. In particular, we found a general pattern underlying the allometry of maximum population density, which stresses the correspondence between the docu- mented linear patterns and triangular relationships between both variables. 3. Two independent data sets, one for mammals and another for intertidal invert- ebrates, showed that medium-size species attain higher population densities, and that population density decreases towards larger and smaller sizes. 4. A more direct calculation of population energy use for mammalian primary con- sumers, based on measured metabolic rates, showed that populations' energy use fluctuates widely among species and that its upper limit is not independent of body size but peaks at a body size of about 100 g, and decreases toward both smaller and larger body sizes. 5. Diet also has a strong effect on this relationship. Omnivores show a positive relationship between population energy use and body size, while this is negative for carnivores and insectivores.

AB  - Previous studies have discussed the evolution of ownership using the Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game. Decisive parameters are resource values (V) and contest costs (C). However, ownership may also evolve as a result of the effects of population density. To compare the effects of population density with those of resource values, I created a learning-based model of a revised Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game. The game simulates the dynamics of agents that struggle for regions ("territories") along a line. With appropriate sets of r (resource value) and l (reciprocal of the population density), the model showed that ownership is more likely to evolve when the resource value is small and population density is high. An area containing high-value resources is likely to accompany high population density. However, simulations showed that population density has stronger effects than resource value on the evolution of ownership.

AB  - Until about 13,000 years ago all humans obtained their food through hunting and gathering, but thereafter people in some parts of the world began a transition to agriculture. Recent data strongly implicate climate change as the driving force behind the agricultural transition in southwest Asia. We propose a model of this process in which population and technology respond endogenously to climate. The key idea is that after a lengthy period of favorable environmental conditions during which regional population grew significantly, an abrupt climate reversal forced people to take refuge at a few ecologically favored sites. The resulting spike in local population density reduced the marginal product of labor in foraging and made agriculture attractive. Once agriculture was initiated, rapid technological progress through artificial selection on plant characteristics led to domesticated varieties. Farming became a permanent part of the regional economy when this productivity growth was combined with climate recovery

AB  - This study investigates the correlation between land cover data and other factors that affect population distribution. The results show that land cover data contain sufficient information to infer population distribution and can be used independently to model the spatial pattern of population density in China. China’s population distribution model (CPDM) was developed based on land cover data to calculate population density in China at 1 km resolution. For cells in rural areas, population probability coefficients were calculated based on weighted linear models, the weights of land cover types being derived from multivariate regression models and on a qualitative order of land types in 12 agro-ecological zones. For cells in urban areas, a power exponential decay model based on city size and the distance from urban center was employed to calculate population probability coefficients. The models were validated in sampled cells using ancillary population data. The validation shows the mean relative error of estimated population to be 3.13 and 5.26% in rural and urban areas, respectively. Compared to existing models, the accuracy of CPDM is much higher at cell, county and province scales.

In a recent commentary, Population Council associate Martha Brady sets forth an argument for sports programs as a way to empower and inform girls, a goal assuming prominence in the Council and other non-governmental organizations concerned with women's rights and human development. "Girls are under tremendous pressure to begin sexual activity and childbearing early. We must address the whole girl and give her the skills and knowledge she needs to exert more control over her life. It makes sense to reach girls at work, school, and play," says Brady. (excerpt)

AB  - The past 30 years have witnessed a rapid increase of migrating population which contributed much to the significant socioeconomic development in China. Therefore, it is necessary to set up a monitoring system to collect the basic information of migrating population resgulary to support the related research and policy decisions effetively and correctively. As a preliminary but serious attempt, The National Population and Family Planning Commission launched a pilot survey on Migrating Population in five major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Chengdu, and Taiyuan in July, 2009. This survey got information of 21771 migrant's families and 47461 individual migrants. based on this data set, this paper first describes the features of living, employment, public service participation, social security integration of the migrating population, and then discussesseveral problems which need to be solved to improve the living situation of migrating population in China.

AB  - Field studies were conducted to clarify whether variation in food availability among habitats influences population density, and whether population density has a negative effect on foraging success in the orb-web spider, Nephila clavata. Lifetime food consumption per individual (i.e., foraging success) strongly correlated with mean body size of adult females and mean fecundity in populations. Also, there was a positive correlation between foraging success and population density. Since foraging success reflected potential prey availability in the habitat, food resource appeared to be a limiting factor for populations in this spider. Mean fecundity per individual correlated with population density of the following year, suggesting that decreased reproduction is a major component of food limitation on population density. Consistent differences in mean body size between particular sites were observed over years, while such difference was less obvious in density. Thus, ranking of food abundance among habitats seems to be predictable between years. A field experiment revealed that an artificial increase in population density had no negative effect on the feeding rate of individuals, suggesting that intraspecific competition for food is not important in this species.

AB  - We analyze a growth model where the damage of pollution depends on population density and the character of pollution. From the steady state rates of change, in the social optimum, of a neoclassical and a semi-endogenous growth model respectively, we conclude that the less responsive the damage of pollution is to population density, the more likely is a development path with positive growth in consumption per capita and declining perceived pollution per capita. Non-awareness of the character of pollution may thus give suboptimal solutions. In particular, the commonly held view that pollution is a pure public bad may lead to growth-rate targets that are lower than optimal. Finally, we find that the character of pollution does not influence the transitional dynamics qualitatively.

AB  - Monitoring is an integral part of species conservation. Monitoring programs must take imperfect detection of species into account in order to be reliable. Theory suggests that detection probability may be determined by population size but this relationship has not yet been assessed empirically. Population size is particularly important because it may induce heterogeneity in detection probability and thereby cause bias in estimates of biodiversity. We used a site occupancy model to analyse data from a volunteer-based amphibian monitoring program to assess how well different variables explain variation in detection probability. An index to population size best explained detection probabilities for four out of six species (to avoid circular reasoning, we used the count of individuals at a previous site visit as an index to current population size). The relationship between the population index and detection probability was positive. Commonly used weather variables best explained detection probabilities for two out of six species. Estimates of site occupancy probabilities differed depending on whether the population index was or was not used to model detection probability. The relationship between the population index and detectability has implications for the design of monitoring and species conservation. Most importantly, because many small populations are likely to be overlooked, monitoring programs should be designed in such a way that small populations are not overlooked. The results also imply that methods cannot be standardized in such a way that detection probabilities are constant. As we have shown here, one can easily account for variation in population size in the analysis of data from long-term monitoring programs by using counts of individuals from surveys at the same site in previous years. Accounting for variation in population size is important because it can affect the results of long-term monitoring programs and ultimately the conservation of imperiled species.

AB  - The negative relationship between body mass and population abundance was documented decades ago and forms one of the most fundamental scaling-laws in ecology. However, current theory fails to capture observed variations and the subject continues to raise controversy. Here we unify empirically observed size-abundance relationships with theory, by incorporating allometries in resource encounter rate and metabolic costs of movements. Fractal geometry is used to quantify the underlying resources distributions. Our model predicts that in environments packed with resources, body mass to population abundance relationships is less negative than the commonly assumed -3/4 power law. When resources are more patchily distributed, we predict a more negative exponent. These predictions are consistent with empirical observations. The current research provides an important step towards synthesizing metabolism, resource distribution and the global scaling of animal abundance, explaining why size-abundance relationships vary among feeding guilds and ecosystems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - There is considerable evidence, from removal experiments and from the addition of resources, that territorial behavior can and does limit population density.  In short-term territory systems there is also evidence that territorial behaviour varies with resource level so as to change density in relation to resources.  Hypotheses on the mechanism of this, involving an interaction between the teritorial aggressiveness of initial settlers and the persistence and aggressiveness of later arrivals and non-territorial individuals, are discussed in detail.  Species with long-term territorial systems seem not to change their aggressiveness or territory size in response to short-term changes in resource abundance.  In such species, any adjustment of territory size to resource level must be carried out over a long period and more study is needed of the mechanisms involved.

The results showed that the population density remarkably affected DBH, individual standing volume, crown width, live branch height, stand volume and wood fiber width; but not affect tree height, basic density of wood, and length of wood fibers. It had a positive relationship with stand volume, live branch height and wood fibers width, and a negative relationship with DBH, individual standing volume and crown width. In addition, E. urophylla had a wide range of reasonable density. For short-rotation puplwoods, the optimum planting density of E. urophylla is 2000 individuals per hectare.

AB  - From 1994 to 1997, I monitored 'Elepaio (Chasiempis sandwichensis), a forest bird endemic to Hawaii, in three sites that differed in either degree of habitat dis- turbance or population density. The goal was to determine whether areas with disturbed forest and reduced population density due to disease were lower-quality habitats that acted as population sinks. Sites where the forest had been disturbed by cattle grazing and timber harvesting contained larger 'Elepaio territories, supported less dense 'Elepaio populations, and had a higher proportion of subadult birds in the breeding population and, thus, can be considered lower-quality habitat for 'Elepaio. However, 'Elepaio populations in disturbed sites did not have lower survival, reproduction, or site fidelity than a population in denser forest, and they were self-sustaining. Disturbed sites were not population sinks maintained by immigration; they simply had a lower carrying capacity. Annual survival of territory- holders was high and was slightly higher in males (0.86 ? 0.04 [mean 1 SE]) than in females (0.79 + 0.05). Fecundity was low, with pairs producing 0.56 + 0.06 fledglings _? per year. Site fidelity was high in males (0.98) and females (0.93), and most birds remained on the same territory for the duration of the study or until their presumed death. Population growth was stable at two sites (X = 0.96 + 0.03, 1.02 + 0.04) and increasing (1.12 ? 0.04) at a site recovering from an epizootic of avian poxvirus. Young, subadult-plumaged males defended smaller territories and produced fewer fledglings than older males, but female age did not affect territory size or reproductive success. Recruitment age was younger where population density was lower.

AB  - Home ranges of desert iguanas, Dipsosaurus dorsalis, were compared during the breeding season at three localities that differed in adult population density. The abundance, richness, and diversity of plant resources varied across sites. Although home range size was not correlated with population density, increasing density was associated with greater home range overlap and a tendency for activity to be restricted to the home range interior. For both males and females, the level of home range advertisement, measured as the frequency of push-up displays, increased with increasing population density. The lack of a reciprocal relationship between population density and home range size may be a consequence of the non-uniform distribution of plants at the three sites. When increases in home range size do not produce linear increases in resources, as is the case for many herbivorous species, patterns of space use may be less related to population density per se than to the distribution of conspecifics and plant resources at a particular site.

AB  - Population density and urbanization  Introduction | Statistics | Standards and methods  The United Nations Statistics Division collects, compiles and disseminates data from national statistical offices on population density and urbanization through the Demographic Yearbook data collection system. A set of tables used in this collection system includes rural/urban breakdowns. Because of significant national differences (PDF 95 KB), ***there is no internationally agreed upon definition of urban and rural that would be applicable to all countries or even to all countries within a region.***  A number of tables presented in the Demographic Yearbook provide disaggregated statistics by urban and rural breakdown. In addition, data on population of capital cities and cities of 100,000 and more inhabitants are also available.  The United Nations Population Division uses these data as input for estimating urbanization. Those estimates are presented in World Urbanization Prospects.  The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) looks at urbanization from a different angle. It collects, collates, analyses and reports data on national, urban/rural and city level in order to monitor human settlement conditions and trends. UN-HABITAT publishes and disseminates data through the Compendium of Human Settlement Statistics, Statistical Annex to the Global report and the State of the World’s Cities Report 2001.

AB  - This article describes a high-resolution land cover data set for Spain and its application to dasymetric population mapping (at census tract level). Eventually, this vector layer is transformed into a grid format. The work parallels the effort of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission, in collaboration with Eurostat and the European Environment Agency (EEA), in building a population density grid for the whole of Europe, combining CORINE Land Cover with population data per commune. We solve many of the problems due to the low resolution of CORINE Land Cover, which are especially visible with Spanish data. An accuracy assessment is carried out from a simple aggregation of georeferenced point population data for the region of Madrid. The bottom-up grid constructed in this way is compared to our top-down grid. We show a great improvement over what has been reported from commune data and CORINE Land Cover, but the improvements seem to come entirely from the higher resolution data sets and not from the statistical modeling in the downscaling exercise. This highlights the importance of providing the research community with more detailed land cover data sets, as well as more detailed population data. The dasymetric grid is available free of charge from the authors upon request.

AB  - The environmental and natural resource problems that afflict most countries of the Asian and Pacific region are caused by human activities, often arising from the needs of growing populations for land to cultivate subsistence crops. These include the farming of marginal land; insufficient fallow periods; the clearing of forest land for agriculture and the felling of trees for firewood and timber. Water pollution, air pollution, deforestation and desertification are related to human activities. One of the priorities for population and development planning in the region will be action-oriented research into the linkages, to guide national and regional development policies. Both population and environmental concerns must be integrated into social and economic development plans in order for development to be sustainable. To achieve these goals, rapid population growth must be slowed and eventually stabilized, while strategies on optimal population distribution should be formulated. Concomitantly, environmental conditions must be maintained or improved through reversing deforestation and erosion in major watersheds; checking the spread of deserts; introducing sustainable water management; reducing acidification and hazardous waste; developing and introducing environmentally safe industrial processes; eliminating hunger through sustainable agriculture; finding new and renewable sources of energy and increasing energy efficiency; and protecting animal and plant species and preventing further loss. To avoid the possible negative consequences, balanced development in an integrated fashion is called for. As far as environmental problems are concerned, there is a growing need for the planning mechanism to take demographic variables into account in a more integrated way than has been done in the past. For purposes of environmental and population planning, a longer-term approach should be taken in addition to the five-year plans.

AB  - Marine fisheries management is a complex process incorporating fisheries biology and stock status information, food web and predator/prey relationships, habitat needs, socioeconomic needs of recreational and commercial fishermen, and law enforcement issues. Understanding how all of these factors interact is a challenging task, even for experts in fisheries science and management. The purpose of this document is to explain the fisheries biology and stock status parts of the equation. It is intended for fishermen and other stakeholders interested in fisheries management issues, and serves as a primer for the technical basis of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission’s decision-making process. The following pages provide an overview of fisheries population dynamics (Chapter 1), fundamental data sources for fisheries stock assessments (Chapter 2), fish biology and life history information (Chapter 3), stock assessment concepts and principles (Chapter 4), common stock assessment models (Chapter 5), biological reference points and their use in gauging stock health and the effectiveness of management measures (Chapter 6), and how these elements fit into the Commission’s fisheries management process (Chapter 7). The guide closes with a glossary of common fisheries language, including all terms in bold text found throughout the document. This publication explains some technical aspects of stock assessments that may be unfamiliar to those not directly involved in fisheries science and the analysis of fish populations. In particular, it is designed for stakeholders involved in Commission activities that have never been exposed to formal fisheries science training, but are asked to comprehend and interpret complicated fisheries concepts. An enhanced knowledge of fisheries science and assessment concepts will promote a better understanding of fisheries management, will promote more informed decision making, and will give stakeholders greater confidence in their significant role in the management process.

AB  - The population density of a Daphnia species seems more dependent on properties specific to the species than on those specific to the point in the season, location within a lake basin or the given lake itself. In spite of week-to-week fluctuations, the population density for each of two common European Daphnia species was found to be remarkably similar within single lakes (from station to station on a single date, and from date to date at a single station) as well as from lake to lake, regardless of trophic state. All lakes on all dates revealed densities in the range 10-50 ind l(-1) for the smaller-bodied D. cucullata and 1-5 ind l(-1) for the larger-bodied D. hyalina, in spite of different intensity of reproduction resulting from different food levels (chlorophyll a between 0.2 and 4.2 mug/l). It can be asserted that the population density of each species remains far below the carrying capacity of the habitat K, and does not depend on food levels, which merely set the rate of population increase, while the population density reflects the species' vulnerability to predation by planktivorous fish. The reactive distance (the distance over which a foraging fish can see its prey) in 1+ roach, a dominant planktivore in the lakes studied, has been found to be twice as great for D. hyalina as for D. cucullata, whatever the light intensity. The relative reactive field volume was therefore an order of magnitude greater for the former than for the latter, showing that the densities of the two prey species would be assessed by a foraging roach as equal when, in reality, they differed by an order of magnitude, as they do in various lakes and in various seasons. The first of the two conclusions is that whatever the growth and reproduction in a population of a cladoceran such as Daphnia, its density would be fixed by mortality induced by fish predation. The second would be, that the difference between the bottom-up and top-down effects in freshwater is more than merely the upward or downward direction along the food web, since the bottom-up effects are about the flow control (the rate of net production, individual growth rate, rate of reproduction) and the top-down about the standing-crop control (biomass, individual body size, population density level).

AB  - Accounting for the variation in the population density among different animal species is a central goal of animal ecology (Andrewartha and Birch 1954). Among mammals, density is closely related to the average adult body mass of the species and to the trophic level occupied by the species (Mohr 1940; Clutton-Brock and Harvey 1977; Eisenberg 1980; Damuth 1981a; Peters 1983; Peters and Raelson 1984). In addition, after the body mass and trophic position of species have been taken into account, population densities appear to vary with habitat (Eisenberg 1980) and biogeographical area (Peters and Raelson 1984). Peters and Raelson have been impressed by the predictive power of these relations: "Because these relations appear so powerful . . . they should be examined as fully as possible before they come into widespread use" (1984, p. 499).

AB  - A computational model of multi-scale population densities was developed based on the native population database of Shijiazhuang city. The model comprises four parts: data processing, down-scaling, data format conversion and up-scaling. Down-scaling was completed by apportioning village population to each street block. The vector dataset of block population was converted into 100m&#x00D7;100m grid dataset, which is the minimum grain population density. By changing the radius of circular filter factor, the up-scaling of population density was realized and the multi-scale population density was obtained. The results show that the long-term balance of human and nature environment can be clearly revealed on the maps of population densities at R &#x003D; 0, R &#x003D;3, R &#x003D;12, R &#x003D;29 and R &#x003D;99.

This study develops a model of the housing market with the property that the major determinant of house price rises relative to incomes is the evolution of population density. The model implies that if population density is on an upward trajectory, rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price responses and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. Rises in population density make high and rising levels of house prices likely; this makes alternatives to standard debt financing of home ownership become more desirable. The impact this has on the structure of risk-sharing contracts between providers of outside equity and homeowners is analysed.

AB  - The Earth's surface has changed considerably over the past centuries. Since the start of the industrial Revolution in the early 1700s, humans from the "Old World" started to colonize the "New World". The colonization processes lead to major changes in global land use and land cover. Large parts of the original land cover have been altered (e.g., deforestation), leading to extra emissions of GHG's to the atmosphere and enhancing global climate change. The spatial and temporal aspects are still not very well known. More and more global integrated environmental assessments concerning global sustainability require long time series of global change indicators, of which population is an important one. This study presents an update of the geo-referenced historical population maps for the period 1700-2000, part of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE), which can be used in integrated models of global change and/or global sustainability.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the construction of a working life tables for males and females in South Africa using the 1996 and 2001 population censuses. The main objective of the paper is to illustrate the use of life table analysis in the examination of the labour force using South African data. The study indicates that based on the 1996 census a South African male who survives to age 15 is expected to live 40.9 years, out of which 35.3 years are expected to be spent in active status and the remaining 5.3 years in inactive years. Similar values for South African females are 49.9 years, 37.9 years and 12 years, respectively. Using 2001 census the study indicates that a South African male who survives to age 15 was expected to live 43.9 years of which 36 years will be in active and 8 years will be inactive whereas a South African female was expected to live 50 years of which 34 years will be active and 16 years will be inactive. It was estimated that out of the total number of males who left the working population in 1996, 50 percent left because of death and another 50 percent left for other reasons other than death. The corresponding figures for females are 28 percent and 62 percent respectively. In 2001, 64 percent of the males left the labour force due to deaths whereas 36 percent left due to other causes. Similar figures for females are 45 percent and 55 percent respectively. These figures suggest an increased proportion of men and women are leaving the labour force due to deaths. This means that mortality takes a heavy toll of the seemingly short economically active life. Probably, this is a reflection of the devastating impact of HIV/AIDS on the working population.

AB  - Badgers are facultatively social, forming large groups at high density. Group-living appears to have high reproductive costs for females, and may lead to increased levels of inbreeding. The extent of female competition for reproduction has been estimated from field data, but knowledge of male reproductive success and the extent of extra-group paternity remains limited. Combining field data with genetic data (16 microsatellite loci), we studied the mating system of 10 badger social groups across 14 years in a high-density population. From 923 badgers, including 425 cubs, we were able to assign maternity to 307 cubs, with both parents assigned to 199 cubs (47%) with 80% confidence, and 14% with 95% confidence. Age had a significant effect on the probability of reproduction, seemingly as a result of a deficit of individuals aged two years and greater than eight years attaining parentage. We estimate that approximately 30% of the female population successfully reproduced in any given year, with a similar proportion of the male population gaining paternity across the same area. While it was known there was a cost to female reproduction in high density populations, it appears that males suffer similar, but not greater, costs. Roughly half of assigned paternity was attributed to extra-group males, the majority of which were from neighbouring social groups. Few successful matings occurred between individuals born in the same social group (22%). The high rate of extra-group mating, previously unquantified, may help reduce inbreeding, potentially making philopatry a less costly strategy.

AB  - In some cases male animals engage in aggressive contests for access to females, in others they adopt more passive strategies and invest in traits that assist them in detecting females or in competing with rivals in other ways, such as sperm competition. One possible factor determining the fitness of these different strategies is population density. Theoretically, aggressive tactics should be found at intermediate population densities. At low densities males that invest in traits related to searching for mates could be favoured, whereas at the highest densities males that fight over females might pay excessive costs for this behaviour because of the number of rival males that they will encounter. Current empirical evidence is mostly consistent with this scheme: in some cases it seems that traits that are associated with locating mates are favoured at low densities, with aggression related traits favoured at higher densities, and in other cases aggression is selected but as density increases less aggressive strategies become more common. There remain substantial differences between species, however, and I discuss how variation in mating system, in the costs of aggression and in the nature of sperm competition, plus ecological differences between species, can change the relationship between population density and the fitness consequences of aggressive and passive behavioural strategies.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Radiotherapy and radiology have been indispensable components in cancer care for many years. The detection limit of small tumor foci as well as the development of radio-resistance and severe side effects towards normal tissues led to the development of strategies to improve radio-diagnostic and -therapeutic approaches by pharmaceuticals. The term radiopharmaceutical has been used for drugs labeled with radioactive tracers for therapy or diagnosis. In addition, drugs have been described to sensitize tumor cells to radiotherapy (radiosensitizers) or to protect normal tissues from detrimental effects of radiation (radioprotectors). The present review summarizes recent concepts on the transport of radiopharmaceuticals, radiosensitizers, and radioprotectors in cells and tissues, e.g. by ATP-binding cassette transporters such as P-glycoprotein. Strengths and weaknesses of current strategies to improve transport-based processes are discussed.

Linear regression was used to examine relationships between population density and four landscape variables. We tested the hypothesis that rare species, which are more affected by fragmentation than the common species, should decrease in population density with decreasing fragment size while the density of common generalist species should be unaffected or increase in smaller fragments. The results revealed that A. montensis and O. nigripes showed no significant association to any landscape variable. The density of D. sublineatus showed a strong tendency to a positive correlation to fragment size as well as a negative correlation to edge density. The results underline the importance of large and connected forest remnants in the Atlantic Rainforest to guarantee an effective protection of endemic small mammal species.

We used a novel approach-based on fully censused and mapped distributions of eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) dreys, beaver (Castor canadensis) lodges, and moose (Alces alces)--to explore the scale-dependence of population density and its relationship to landscape features. We identified population units at several scales, both objectively, using cluster analysis, and arbitrarily, using artificial bounds centred on high-abundance sites. Densities declined with census area. For dreys, this relationship was stronger in objective versus arbitrary population units. Drey density was inconsistently related to patch area, a relationship that was positive for all patches but negative when non-occupied patches were excluded. Drey density was negatively related to the proportion of green-space and positively related to the density of buildings or roads, relationships that were accentuated at coarser scales. Mean drey densities were more sensitive to scale when calculated as organism-weighted versus area-weighted averages. Greater understanding of these scaling effects is required to facilitate comparisons of population density across studies.

AB  - Problem statement: Rural population density has a very significant independent influence over important demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the world rural communities. Thus, the understanding of rural population density becomes an important issue to be studied. Approach: Using the rural settled areas of Shaqlawa District as a case study, this study seeks to reveal the specific importance of rural population density as an important variable in understanding the socioeconomic characteristics of sparsely settled rural regions, where spares and falling density presents practical and conceptual problems for rural planners. Results and Conclusion: It is obvious that the need of rural areas for socioeconomic development and regeneration along with the need for diversification of their economic base so as to meet the changes is today greater than ever. The motivation behind of this project is based on the fact that during the last few decades the rural settlement in the study area has been dramatically changed. However at the same time there is a realization that certain parts of the rural area have been left behind in development and the authority is currently promoting rural area in order to sustain local economies and to enhance employment and growth.

AB  - Space use patterns of California voles are described from intensive live-trapping data obtained during the late breeding season in a peak density year. Operational sex rations were strongly female biased. Breeding males had mutually exclusive home ranges that overlapped the home ranges of one to several females. The average male home range was larger than the average female home range and tended to encompass female home ranges in their entirety. Breeding females had home ranges that often overlapped extensively with the home ranges of other breeding females. The degree of overlap, however, tended to be either very high or very low, indicating that groups of females may act territorially among themselves. Family groups that may include members of sequential litters formed at high density. Males on experimental removal grids had larger home ranges than males on the high density grids and some became wanderers while most females had home ranges comparable to those on the high density grids. Dispersers onto low density grids were not a random sample of the high density population; large breeding adults and small juveniles were under-represented. No sex differences in dispersal were noted. Immigration into the high density populations was probably negligible.

AB  - World population is projected to reach 7 billion early in 2012, up from the current 6.8 billion, and surpass 9 billion people by 2050, reveals the 2008 Revision of the official United Nations population estimates and projections, released today. Most of the additional 2.3 billion people will enlarge the population of developing countries, which is projected to rise from 5.6 billion in 2009 to 7.9 billion in 2050, and will be distributed among the population aged 15-59 (1.2 billion) and 60 or over (1.1 billion) because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries will decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to change minimally, passing from 1.23 billion to 1.28 billion, and would have declined to 1.15 billion were it not for the projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is projected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. The results of the 2008 Revision incorporate the findings of the most recent national population censuses and of numerous specialized population surveys carried out around the world. The 2008 Revision provides the demographic data and indicators to assess trends at the global, regional and national levels and to calculate many other key indicators commonly used by the United Nations system.

AB  - Data from 487 municipal governments with populations greater than 50,000 are examined to see the relationship between population density and per capita government expenditures. There is no statistically significant relationship between per capita total government expenditures and operational expenditures for cities smaller than 500,000, and for larger cities, higher population density is associated with higher per capita government expenditures. Infrastructure expenditures tend to decline with increases in population density for cities smaller than 500,000, whereas expenditures on services tend to increase with population density for cities larger than 500,000. The relationship between per capita total expenditures and population density has policy relevance because it indicates that when all government expenditures are taken into account, policies that increase population density will not reduce per capita government expenditures and, in larger cities, will lead to higher per capita government expenditures.

AB  - Scaling relationships that describe variation in population density with body size in ecological communities, such as the thinning law in plant ecology(1-3), can be explained in terms of how individuals use resources as a function of their size. Data for rates of xylem transport as a function of stem diameter show that rates of resource use in individual plants scale as approximately the 3/4 power of body mass, which is the same as metabolic rates of animals(4-7). Here we use this relationship to develop a mechanistic model for relationships between density and mass in resource-limited plants. It predicts that average plant size should scale as the -4/3 power of maximum population density, in agreement with empirical evidence and comparable relationships in animals(5,6,8), but significantly less than the -3/2 power predicted by geometric models(1). Our model implies that fundamental constraints on metabolic rate are reflected in the scaling of population density and other ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including the finding that resource allocation among species in ecosystems is independent of body size(5,6,8).
