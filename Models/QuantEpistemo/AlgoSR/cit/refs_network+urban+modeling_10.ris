AB  - Urban containment strategies are one of the best-known planning instruments for managing urban sprawl. The two main types of such strategies are greenbelts and urban growth boundaries. The boundaries set by the Land Use Plan in Switzerland have been applied since 1970. We evaluate the effect and success of this strategy by analysing expansion of developed land, change in number of buildings, and building density within and outside building zones in four Swiss municipalities 1970-2000. Our results show that the boundary restricted most development to building zones and promoted increased building density. Generally, building density increased in the building zones but decreased outside of building zones. For more efficiency and success, the political institutions should specify explicit goals for development inside and outside of building zones, and develop new instruments for guiding development outside of building zones.

AB  - In the reliable network design problem (RNDP) the main sources of\nuncertainty are variable demand and route choice. The objective is to\nmaximize network total travel time reliability (TTR), which is defined\nas the probability that the network total travel time will be less than\na threshold. A framework is presented for a stochastic network model\nwith Poisson-distributed demand and uncertain route choice. The\ntravelers are assumed to choose their routes to minimize their perceived\nexpected travel cost following the probit stochastic user equilibrium\ncondition. An analytical method is presented for approximation of the\nfirst and second moments of the total travel time. These moments are\nthen fitted with a log-normal distribution. Then the design problem is\ntackled in which the analytical derivative of the TTR is derived with\nthe sensitivity analysis of the equilibrated path choice probability.\nThis derivative is then supplied to a gradient-based optimization\nalgorithm to solve the RNDP. The algorithm is tested with a small\nnetwork example.

AB  - Spatially land use models are indispensable for sustainable land use planning. This study demonstrates a combined Markov-Cellular Automata model to analyze temporal change and spatial distribution of land use stressed by natural and socioeconomic factors in Saga, Japan. Firstly, area change and spatial distribution of land use are calculated using GIS technology, and then the transition among different land use types is analyzed to obtain the transformation matrices during a period of 1976-2006. Meanwhile, an integration evaluation procedure with natural and socioeconomic data is used to generate the transition potential maps. Secondly, using the transition potential maps and transition matrices, a Markov-Cellular Automata model is established to simulate spatial distribution of land use in 2006. Finally, we use this Markov-Cellular Automata model to forecast the future land use changes during the period of 2015-2042. As a consequence, area change simulation predicts a continuing downward trend in agriculture land and forestland areas, as well as an upward trend in built-up areas; spatial distribution simulation indicates that built-up land will expand toward suburban regions, and land use of urban center is at the decline stage. Hence, if the current trends keep constant without holistic sustainable development measures, severe land use decline will ensue. The study is anticipated to help local authorities better understand and address a complex land use system, and develop the improved land use management strategies that can better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Green Belt policies have helped to create chaotic landscapes at the rural-urban interfaces of the United Kingdom's largest cities. Their prime functions, to control urban sprawl and preserve an encircling green girdle to separate the urban from the open countryside, have created 'edgelands' that have been remarkably dynamic despite relatively strong controls on certain types of development. A detailed case study of one part of London's Metropolitan Green Belt, drawing upon analysis of planning registers, reveals long-term trends in land-use change linked to the development controls operated within the context of the Green Belt and the adjacent built-up area. This paper also outlines the history of the Green Belt policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and discusses recently proposed policy changes that have provoked ongoing debate about this form of control on urban sprawl and its consequences for the land use of Green Belts and the edgelands. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As concern grows regarding urban sprawl and forest and agricultural land preservation, the effectiveness of land-use policies in shaping land-use change warrants further study. We evaluate the impact of county-level zoning laws, the most predominant land use policy in the USA, and land rents on the relative amounts of forest, agricultural, and developed land, while controlling for demographic information and taxation rates. Over the past decades, southern Indiana has experienced forest regrowth on private lands, but this regrowth has declined in recent years with increased conversion of open space for urban residential development. We develop a model of land-use shares in 40 southern Indiana counties based on the net benefits to agriculture, forestland, and urban uses using a maximum likelihood estimation of a Dirichlet distribution. We find agricultural land rent and indicators of land productivity are the most important predictors of the proportion of agriculture and urban uses. Forest use is better explained by shifting regional economic structure and hilly terrain. Counties with a greater proportion of their work force in the service sectors have a greater proportion of land forested. Finally, to some extent zoning may protect agricultural land in the region, although land rents, land characteristics, and population are strong predictors of the ratio of agriculture to urban use. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - With nearly half of the worldâs population living in urban areas, the logic of growing more food in the city, close to the point of consumption, seems overwhelming. Many of the most effective inventions of an era actually are not entirely new when they break ground. More often than not, they are reapplications of existing technologies to a new or different problem. This process of adapting an extant technology to a different problem is at the heart of a new approach to sustainable food production. As ever more attention is directed at the environmental flaws in todayâs agricultural industry, and as global climate change and its implications place additional constraints on available resources of land, water, and energy, the need for creative and adaptive methods of food production has become clear. This article proposes a new, effective, and pragmatic approach to urban agriculture. The two questions it seeks to address are how and where food is produced.

AB  - In the global context, the population of cities and urbanized areas has developed from a minority to become the majority. Now cities are the largest, most complex and most dynamic man-made systems. They are vibrant centres of cultural life and engines that drive local and global economies. Yet, contemporary urbanized areas are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable entities laying increasing pressure on the surrounding rural areas. Traditional methods of planning and managing large cities that lead to this situation have reached their limits. The planning and design processes therefore need a radical re-thinking. On the computational side, this necessitates the integration of new methods and instruments. On the planning and design side, this requires the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers much earlier than normally done in the past. The combination of interactive design and computation will demonstrate the effects and side effects of urban-rural planning or re-development. We build our design research approach on dynamics and scale: viewing cities and settlements as entities with dynamic urban metabolisms, we propose to apply stocks and flows simulations to the building scale (small, S-Scale), to the urban scale (medium, M-Scale), and to the territorial scale (large, L-Scale). Our long-term goal is the sustainable urban-rural system. Planning and implementation examples from Switzerland and ETH Zurich Science City serve as test cases, with the intent to use the findings for developments in other parts of the world.

This paper reviews the latest use of smart cards in securing network, online services, operating systems, and card-holder identity. Smart card network authentication is routinely used on GSM and 3G networks, and this paper shows how the same infrastructure can be extended to perform WiFi access point authentication. Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication. Finally, the paper will show how smart cards and trusted platform module have complementary roles for recuring the operating systems, and the use of smart cards in identity frameworks such as liberty alliance or Microsoft cardspace.

AB  - This paper presents a generalized land-use model to determine the most efficient utilization of land based on two interactive objectives: (1) Maximi- zation of return; and (2) minimization of the sum of weighted distances among the different land-use units. The problem is solved according to each separate objective. Each solution is taken as an alternative. The effectiveness of each alternative is calculated (i.e., the sum of weighted efficiencies of each alternative in terms of each objective). The alternative that has the maximum effectiveness is chosen as the most efficient land-use pattern. A numerical example is given for a hypothetical region. The novelty of this approach is its ability to illustrate the impact of two objectives on the pattern of land-use and urban form. The results from this model should influence the way decisions are made, simply by changing the informational context within which the decision-making process takes place. Some possible ex- tensions of the model are suggested for further research.

However, textual information is acquiring an increasing importance with the appearance of methods for textual data mining. This paper proposes the use of classical clustering algorithms with a mixed function that combines numerical, categorical and semantic features. The content of the semantic features is extracted from textual data. This paper analyses and compares the behavior of different existing semantic similarity functions that use WordNet as background ontology. The different partitions obtained with the clustering algorithm are compared to human classifications in order to see which one approximates better the human reasoning. Moreover, the interpretability of the obtained clusters is discussed. The results show that those similarity measures that provide better results when compared using a standard benchmark also provide better and more interpretable partitions.

AB  - We present a method for interactive procedural generation of parcels within the urban modeling pipeline. Our approach performs a partitioning of the interior of city blocks using user-specified subdivision attributes and style parameters. Moreover, our method is both robust and persistent in the sense of being able to map individual parcels from before an edit operation to after an edit operation - this enables transferring most, if not all, cus- tomizations despite small to large-scale interactive editing operations. The guidelines guarantee that the resulting subdivisions are functionally and geometrically plausible for subsequent building modeling and construction. Our results include visual and statistical comparisons that demonstrate how the parcel configurations created by our method can closely resemble those found in real-world cities of a large variety of styles. By directly addressing the block subdivision problem, we intend to increase the editability and realism of the urban modeling pipeline and to become a standard in parcel generation for future urban modeling methods.

This study aims at the application of ecological principles to develop an integrated urban land-use planning for Panyu case that could optimize the urban ecosystem. Panyu is classified into four functional zones: (1) ecological protection areas, which are important to maintain regional ecological process; (2) re- stricted construction areas, which can be changed and adjusted over time without losing the conservation potential; (3) suitable construction areas, which are set aside for future development; and (4) built-up areas. Different land-use management measures with emphases either on ecological aims or on construction are proposed. Ecological patches are connected by corridors to form an ecological network, which is spatially flexible and has the potential to integrate development and conservation and make conservation of species diversity adaptive. The writers predict that ecosystem service will increase by 16.91% after the implementation of their plan.

AB  - For Central Europe urbanization and urban sprawl are the major processes concerning land-use and land-cover change that alter the characteristic and functioning of the landscape permanently. Against the background of the current sustainable development debate there is an increasing demand of reliable information about the future trends of these land-use developments. Remote Sensing provides the required data and methods for an operational monitoring of land-use/-cover changes. However for the prediction of future trends additional information and a deep understanding of the driving forces of land-use/-cover change is needed. Here we show an exemplary pathway for obtaining the required future land-use information using accurate and stable techniques. We acquired historical land-use information using Landsat imagery. The measured changes (e.g. an increase of urban areas of about 37% between 1984 and 2005) are driven by a variety of socio-economic causes that have been evaluated statistically. We used this information to calibrate a spatial predictive model that has been implemented in the generic modeling framework XULU (eXtendable Unified LandUse Modeling Platform).

AB  - The island of Puerto Rico has both a high population density and a long history of ineffective land use planning. This study integrates geospatial technology and population census data to understand how people use and develop the lands. We define three new regions for Puerto Rico: Urban (16%), Densely Populated Rural (36%), and Sparsely Populated Rural (48%). Eleven percent of the island is composed of urban/built-up surfaces. A large part of these developments occur in both low-density patterns of construction and sparsely populated neighborhoods. Half of the urban development occurs outside of urban centers. This analysis helps differentiate zones in the landscape with different uses and conditions, identifying not only urban and rural settings, but also the interface where development occurs in a territory dominated by forests and pastures, analogous to a wildland urban interface. The ineffective plan of land development has left a high degree of urban sprawl in 40% of island, where cities and towns appear typically surrounded by sprawl. The San Juan Metropolitan Area is one of the most expanded urbanized areas with a population of 2-2.5 million, comparable with the most sprawled cities of the U.S. mainland. This study reinforces the need for an efficient land use planning, and provides information to support research and planning efforts related to land development and conservation. It represents the first approach integrating satellite imagery with population census data for studying the human environment in the Caribbean. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Until very recently, urban land-use planning in Indonesia was largely top-down in character and neglected to include the public as a stakeholder. This article argues that the role of government in urban land-use development needs to change at all levels and that the capacity of local government in land-use management needs to be strengthened. The presence of private developers in urban development should be encouraged. Land development permitsâas a means of urban development controlâwhile they may still be necessary should be granted primarily in relation to urban land-use plans (RUTR). Land taxation instruments have not been effectively applied to control land utilisation in the cities. Data and information on land affairs are lacking.

Therefore empirical inference from observed network characteristics to the processes that could be responsible for network genesis and dynamics cannot be based only, or mainly, on the observed degree distribution.

AB  - The paper analyses the changing pattern of land uses in rural settlements located in the rural-urban fringe and makes a link between the results to socio-economic developments and to changes in the rural policy at the national level. Using historical sequences of land use maps and using geostatistical analysis, we observe changing land use patterns in three Moshav type settlements - the most common type of rural settlement in Israel - in three different rural-urban fringes belts along the coastal area. We identify basic trends of specialisation and intensification of agricultural land use as well as expansion of built up structures for residential and commercial purposes. These trends which are rather similar for all three cases, we argue, reflect economic and social changes in rural settlements in general and in the rural-urban fringe in particular. The evolving patterns in the three Moshavim in the Israeli rural-urban fringe (RUF) can be understood as adjustment measures at the household level to development and changing policies at the macro level, particularly towards the rural sector. There are two major domains of change. First, a transition from dependence on farming to a more diversified economic base suggesting newly shaped interrelationships with the urban space. Second, a new residential development program which has rejuvenated failing and ageing rural settlements. The outcome is a major process of restructuring which affects the economic, social and environmental spheres, and necessitates sensitivity on the part of institutional decision makers towards the complex and diverse realities of relevant actors on the ground, through which all current and future land use policies are mediated. Moreover, being exposed to uncontrolled and often chaotic adjustment measures over the last three decades, it might be necessary to regulate and preserve some of the Moshav's distinct features so it does not to fade into an 'ordinary suburb'. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A geographic information system (GIS) was a useful aid in the assessment of urban nonpoint source pollution and the development of a pollution control strategy. The GIS was used for data integration and display, and to provide data for a nonpoint source model. An empirical nonpoint source loading model driven by land use was used to estimate pollutant loadings of priority pollutants. Pollutant loadings were estimated at fine spatial resolution adn aggregated to storm sewer drainage basins (sewersheds). Eleven sewersheds were generated from digital versions of sewer maps. The pollutant loadings of individual land use polygons, derived as the units of analysis from street blocks, were aggregated to get total polutant loadings within each sewershed. Based on the model output, a critical sewershed was located. Pollutant loadings at major sewer junctions within the critical sewershed were extimated to develop a mitigation strategy. Two approaches based on the installation of wet ponds were investigated -- a regional approach using one large wet pond at the major sewer outfall and a multisite approach using a number of smaller sites for each major sewer junction. Cost analyses showed that the regional approach would be more cost effective, though it would provide less pollution control.

AB  - One of the major issues in the urban development process in the developing world, not least in Nigeria, is the implication of land use developments and planning for environmental sustainability. Land use planning has an impact on the efficiency of economic and social activities and also on the physical development of a city. However, in several developing countries, such as Nigeria, the inadequacy of urban land development and planning has led to concerns regarding the environmental sustainability of the urban centres. To understand the contemporary urban land use pattern in Nigeria and its shortcomings, it is important to examine the characteristics of past and present land use structure, the planning framework and imperatives for the future of urban development in the country. Among other things, the paper argues that the traditional urban planning framework, its administration, and the associated master planning which still dominate planning in Nigeria, have less than adequately ensured environmental sustainability. Emphasis is placed on residential land use. It is argued that the planning system, which is essentially a colonial legacy, does not adequately respond to evolving changes in cultural, economic and social developments and, hence, the spatial impact on residential land use.

AB  - Computer graphics and its broader application as visualization are at last beginning to have an impact on the ways analysts and model builders articulate and communicate their intellectual understanding of urban systems. Geographic information systems (GIS) lie in the vanguard of these developments and there is presently much effort in linking these systems to traditional spatial models so that the power of GIS databases and display capabilities can be harnessed. To demonstrate the import of these ideas, a prototypical visual environment has been developed for such modeling and in this paper it is shown how it can be implemented. The elements of such visualization are first defined in terms of the model-based processes which characterize applications, emphasizing data exploration, model calibration, prediction, and prescription. These processes are then concentrated through model inputs, outputs, and causal structures, illustrating the operation of various model sectors through different modes of spatial statistical and graphic analysis. These ideas are implemented through windowing systems which mix text, numerics, and graphics, and are illustrated using an elementary model of residential location of Melbourne, Australia. The operation of the model in a UNIX environment which is accessed through proprietary windows-based software is demonstrated, thus providing a platform to discuss the problems of linking conventional model-based techniques to graphics software in general, GIS in particular. The paper is concluded with a sketch for future work.

AB  - This study applied logistic regression to model urban growth in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area of Georgia in a GIS environment and to discover the relationship between urban growth and the driving forces. Historical land use/cover data of Atlanta were extracted from the 1987 and 1997 Landsat TM images. Multi-resolution calibration of a series of logistic regression models was conducted from 50 m to 300 m at intervals of 25 m. A fractal analysis pointed to 225 m as the optimal resolution of modeling. The following two groups of factors were found to affect urban growth in different degrees as indicated by odd ratios: (1) population density, distances to nearest urban clusters, activity centers and roads, and high/low density urban uses (all with odds ratios < 1); and (2) distance to the CBD, number of urban cells within a 7 ?? 7 cell window, bare land, crop/grass land, forest, and UTM northing coordinate (all with odds ratios > 1). A map of urban growth probability was calculated and used to predict future urban patterns. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.85 indicates that the probability map is valid. It was concluded that despite logistic regression's lack of temporal dynamics, it was spatially explicit and suitable for multi-scale analysis, and most importantly, allowed much deeper understanding of the forces driving the growth and the formation of the urban spatial pattern. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective of our work\nis to use genetic algorithms to effectively calibrate, i.e., identify\ntransition rule values, a cellular automata urban growth model that\nis designed as a function of multitemporal satellite imagery and\npopulation density. Transition rules in our model identify the required\nneighborhood urbanization level for a test pixel to develop. Calibration\nis performed spatially to find best rule values per township.

AB  - Categorizes three direct-axis and four quadrature-axis models, along with the basic transient reactance model. Discusses some of the assumptions made in using various models and presents the fundamental equations and concepts involved in generator/system interfacing. Covers, generally, the various attributes of power system stability, recognizing two basic approaches. The first is categorized under large disturbance nonlinear analysis; the second approach considers small disturbances, where the corresponding dynamic equations are linearized. Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.

AB  - The role of agriculture in an agrarian economy like Nigeria as a pathfinder to understanding the sustainability of the environment cannot be over emphasized, rapid, largely unchecked, urbanization is common in many urban centres such as the Lagos metropolis. Associated with these are the key problems of urban poverty and food security, urban land market, and issues related to sustainable urban development. Urban agriculture (UA) is in reality and in many cases a response to crisis and a coping strategy of the urban poor UA can contribute to food security in several ways. It increases the amount of food available and enhances the freshness of perishable foods reaching urban consumers. UA can also play a role in environmental conservation. However, UA production systems can pose risks to public health and the environment. These arise from the inappropriate or excessive use of agri- cultural inputs-including pesticides, nitrogen, and raw organic matter containing heavy metal residues. Urban land use planners should endeavour to promote multifunctional land use, and greater community participation in the management of urban open spaces as a way of integrating UA as a key concept in urban development programmes.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach for modeling urban road network based on manual marking information. A series of procedural method are applied to realize 3D model of road networks in an accurate and efficient way. Firstly, we use polygonal approximation based method to model the road element according to the centerline of roads guided by aerial photographs. And then curve approximation is used for modeling intersections and sidewalks with several different strategies. Finally, we use all the road elements, intersections and sidewalks to construct an urban road network. Our approach is successfully applied to the road network modeling of large urban city in real world. The practical application proofs the efficiency of modeling and the effect of rendering with this approach.

AB  - Literature suggests that present urban design plans and methods are inadequate to deal with the scale and complexity of contemporary urban form and multidisciplinary collaborative practice. Although recent developments in urban modeling technologies have brought about a wide range of different techniques and potential implementations that may help address this inadequacy, they have not yet made their desired impact on the design process. Failure to use these capabilities extensively in actual practice may result primarily from a limited understanding of the proper role these tools should play or the impact they may have. There is also hesitation about which are appropriate and effective applications, and little consensus on the methods with which these capabilities should be used in core design activities. More investigation is needed to understand fully their application in urban design practice. This research suggests a methodological framework underlying the methods of using various urban modeling functionalities. A questionnaire survey method was used to document the methods and assess the extents to which designers used urban modeling tools in developing eight urban design plans. The questionnaire survey findings were compared with the theoretical premises. The findings showed that design methodology is the main factor that affects the effectiveness of modeling to support design activities. The findings showed extensive, inconsistent usage and various degrees of support for design activities that resulted in various degrees of impact on urban design aspects. The findings suggest the provision of dynamic visualization supported by efficient networking may advance urban modeling to become a tool of public advocacy and design decision support which can advance urban design practice to informational, communicational, and representational systems.

AB  - Our understanding of the effects of land use regulations and other aspects of urban form has been hindered by limited aggregate data and gradual temporal changes in policies. More widely available GIS data on land use and land economics presents opportunities to overcome these obstacles. This study was undertaken to explore the potential for land economics research that draws on parcel level spatial data for urban land markets, and uses differences across a sample of cities as the source of variation. Policy obstacles such as protected open spaces and other land use regulations, like the limitations caused by land forms such as water bodies and mountains, can be expected to alter the supply of land in ways that will be reflected in land market outcomes across cities. Based on a sample of data for 46 California cities, this exploratory analysis analyzed land market outcomes as a function of population, income and other factors in a closed-economy model, including a ratio that measures the concentration of developed lands within a city's radius or perimeter. The approach produced robust relationships consistent with other studies, and results consistent with expectations not just in terms of the signs of the estimated coefficients but in terms of their magnitudes as well. Indeed, the elasticity of land development with respect to population has been estimated to be 0.79-0.82 based on open city models. The evidence suggests that both land forms and land use regulations have a positive effect on land prices; however, it was not possible with the current data to distinguish the amenity effects of proximity to oceans and mountains from the supply constraints on radial city expansion. The analysis, nevertheless, provides encouraging evidence for future research of this kind. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The challenge of facilitating economic density is fundamental for successful urbanization. Flexible and forward-looking institutions that help the efficient functioning of land markets are vital in this respect. In particular, institutional arrangements for regulating land use, managing public land and allocating land rights have significant implications for how cities deliver agglomeration economies and improve the welfare of their residents. This book provides fresh insights into these issues, compiling selected pieces of analytical and empirical research presented at the World Bank's Fourth Urban Research Symposium on Urban Land Use and Land Markets, held in Washington, DC, May 2007. Specially commissioned papers helped develop a robust analytical foundation to clarify ongoing debates on urban land management and welfare and synthesized the political and administrative challenges of improving the efficiency of urban land markets. Among the questions that this book addresses are: - Does more public intervention in land markets produce more affordable land market outcomes? - Do conventional approaches to strengthening property rights bolster security of tenure and market transactions? - How should governments go about integrating informal settlements with the broader city economy?

AB  - This paper presents an urban land-use simulation model using cellular automata (CA). In the model urban growth is regarded as the result of a global process underpinned by local actions and land-use change as the joint action of three different effects: attribute, heterogeneity, and gravity. The attribute and heterogeneity effects are regarded as different aspects of a local driving force for change constituted by changing accessibility and other attributes resulting from the interaction of land use and transport at the neighborhood level. The gravity effect is a universal resistance to change as a result of inertia and agglomeration of compatible land uses in the vicinity. To ensure that local actions would lead to global behavior, a multipass, in addition to a single-pass, land-use-allocation algorithm is designed to mimic land-use changes. With metropolitan Melbourne in Australia as a case study, the performance of the model in replicating land-use changes is compared with that of an alternative model developed by using only a distance function. The results of the comparison show that the proposed CA model outperforms the alternative model with only a distance function, confirming the importance of incorporating local attributes in modeling land-use changes.

AB  - This paper formulates a random-growth urban model with a notion of geographical fitness. Using techniques of complex-network theory, we study our system as a type of preferential-attachment model with fitness, and we analyze its macro behavior to clarify the properties of the city-size distributions it predicts. First, restricting the geographical fitness to take positive values and using a continuum approach, we show that the city-size distributions predicted by our model asymptotically approach Pareto distributions with coefficients greater than unity. Then, allowing the geographical fitness to take negative values, we perform local coefficient analysis to show that the predicted city-size distributions can deviate from Pareto distributions, as is often observed in actual city-size distributions. As a result, the model we propose can generate a generic class of city-size distributions, including but not limited to Pareto distributions. For applications to city-population projections, our simple model requires randomness only when new cities are created, not during their subsequent growth. This property leads to smooth trajectories of city population growth, in contrast to other models using Gibrat's law. In addition, a discrete form of our dynamical equations can be used to estimate past city populations based on present-day data; this fact allows quantitative assessment of the performance of our model. Further study is needed to determine appropriate formulas for the geographical fitness. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

Many suburbs--like Buckhead, a suburb of Atlanta--have become successful because they cater to the needs of their residents; however, traffic congestion, inadequate land use planning, and competition from outer-ring suburbs threaten the suburb, just as they threatened inner-city areas. Suburban areas must have upscale housing as well as nearby affordable housing for workers, nearby shopping, ample recreation and entertainment, security, good schools, access to major transportation arteries, and a diversified tax base. Inefficiently allocated resources and car domination lead to problems in the suburbs. Better planning and the banning together of community member s can help solve some of the problems facing suburbs.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - Provision of recreational open space is a major factor in determining resident quality of life in cities. However, urban growth and land use change models typically omit park location and allocation issues when simulating changing urban environments. This paper introduces a method for exploring the spatial allocation of urban parks (public, recreational open spaces) given differing municipal and county investment decisions. Park planning literature has established level of service metrics as rough indicators of provision of public park amenities that are useful guides for future park investment decisions within a given jurisdiction. In this study, we create a dynamic-demand location model that simulates political feedback from population growth and LOS metrics to allocate new parklands (similar to 0.5 ha <= neighborhood parks <= similar to 4 ha) in multi-jurisdictional urbanizing regions. We frame parks as a new development type that augments residential development currently driving a version of the Regional Urban Growth (RUG) urban simulation model, an open source, raster-based simulation platform. Our approach allows planners and researchers to explore urban patterns and distributive outcomes associated with different local open space requirements and investment choices. We illustrate this approach under scenarios for the rapidly growing, three-county Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region of North Carolina, USA. We test varying delays in park planning, purchase, and construction, varying maximum park sizes, and the effects of increased investment levels in two jurisdictions within our study area. This model suggests that the most important aspect of successful park planning is the length of the lag time between residential and park development. Perhaps the most successful park planning strategy is to plan parks along with residential areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These simulations present interesting results about the effect of borders between the Montpellier Agglomeration perimeter and its neighbors, with the differencial application of the SCoT spatial planning tool. The other main important result is the difference between the "Business As usual" scenario results for 2025 and the ones for the High Tech Scenario (Scot applied): in the first case, a important urban sprawl is possible, with particular fragmentation of new urban areas with little surfaces which affect the periurban landscape. The next step is to present these final and complete results to the local stakeholders who are relevant in the spatial planning.

AB  - The modern city is a complex system with large amount of information. Discovering the hidden causal relationships among urban operational factors is a key research issue in city planning. Traditional approaches that concentrate on one aspect (e.g. transport) may have limitation when the city planning needs holistic analysis and an interoperable view of the city system. We introduce a systematic factor analysis approach for urban information by using Bayesian Network (BN) framework. We build a BN structure to present the causal relationships among city information factors based on integrated data sets. In addition, our approach is a dynamic modeling method because the learned BN structure will change in different time periods depends on the different service that the city provides. With structural leaning and real time monitoring, we perform Bayesian inference on the BN structure and the transformation of BN structure. We provide high level views to planners in the sense that identifying the potential cause or outcome of a city operational factor and examining the implementation of certain policies. Opinions from city planning experts may help us improve our model.

AB  - Americans are voracious consumers of urban land. Between 1950 and 1990, urban land quintupled while urban populations merely doubled. The nation's urban roadway capacity and urban traffic volumes have expanded in proportions appropriate to growth in urban land. Yet, the process is taking on an exponential form as rates of expansion increase upon themselves. This is due to what Newman and Kenworthy (1999) call a "vicious cycle," the mutually reinforcing effects of roadway capacity expansion, reduced developmental densities, more expansive urban land consumption, longer and more frequent trip-making, and calls for even more roadway capacity.   Our hypotheses are: (1) that this vicious cycle accounts for increases in urban land consumption, vehicle miles traveled, roadway capacity, and urban environmental degradation at rates disproportionately high relative to the underlying rates of demographic and economic change and (2) that recognizing and regulating the strength of this reciprocally reinforcing feedback loop is essential for the successful management not only of urban densities, trip generation, and traffic congestion but also of urban environmental indicators such as energy use, air-shed emissions, water demand, and infrastructure costs.   To test these hypotheses, we present a system dynamics model that simulates over a 25-year period Newman and Kenworthy's vicious cycle and, through a simple environmental-engineering sub-model, identifies its long-term impacts on a representative aspect of the urban environment.

It highlights land use planning and management policies and regulations in the city. It further discusses the implications of uncoordinated land use management in context of developing world cities and suggests how to improve the present inefficient practices. The paper draws on a systematic survey of land use mechanisms and activities, departments and agencies of government responsible for land use planning and management as well as individuals involved in land use activities including land owners in the study area. The paper revealed that land use management in the city has been wholly concerned with the granting of statutory right of occupancy and approval of plans to use land for different purposes, without adequate monitoring of its outcomes. It also shows that land management and control tools are either not available or weakly implemented and disjointed and uncoordinated since several organizations and agencies are involved without a coordinating agency or an overall land use plan within which effective land use management can be undertaken. It suggests a reorganization of urban land use planning and management machinery in the area and institutionalization of Local Planning Authority as indispensable to achieving sustainable land use planning and management in the city.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

AB  - This paper estimates econometric models of the socioeconomic drivers of urban land use change in the Pearl River Delta, China. The panel data used to estimate the models are generated by combining high-resolution remote sensing data with economic and demographic data from annual compendium. The relations between variables are estimated using a random coefficient model. Results indicate that urban expansion is associated with foreign direct investment and relative rates of productivity generated by land associated with agricultural and urban uses. This suggests that large-scale investments in industrial development, rather than local land users, play the major role in urban land conversion. (JEL R14)

AB  - With the digital city proposed, 3D visualization of underground pipe network, as an important part of the integrated management system of urban GIS, has now become the focus of attention of many scholars. In order to resolve the problems on the current 3D modeling method of urban underground pipeline network, we present a novel algorithm based on a 3D component library in this paper. The algorithm, introduces the concept of 3D component library, makes the 3D models of standard pipe fittings as element components and splits the complex 3D model of the underground pipeline network into several element components. The element components are classified by type and stored in the 3D component library. When construct the underground pipe network 3D models, firstly, gets the element components by the type ID of 2D entities, then through the approach that the combination of different element components, we can obtain the accurate 3D models. Comparing with the traditional 3D modeling method of urban underground pipeline network, this new algorithm is more lifelike and accurate. The system based on the method can improve the efficiency of its development and the reusability of its resource. This new algorithm also provides a common solution for a complex 3D model, which can construct the 3D model of complex urban facilities, such as overpass.

AB  - The concept of sustainable development has led to a paradigm shift in urban planning in European cities. In recent years air pollution, traffic noise and loss of open space and more recently energy scarcity and climate change have become leading issues of urban planning. This paper looks into the achievements and challenges of transport and land use planning in European cities today. It starts with an overview on current policies at the European level to promote a better integration of transport and land use planning in European cities, summarises the results of studies on integrated transport and land-use strategies and presents examples of successful best practice in this field in European cities. To demonstrate the magnitude of the challenge, it presents results of the EU project STEPs (Scenarios for the Transport System and Energy Supply and their Potential Effects), which examined the impact of different scenarios of fuel price increases, resulting market responses and different combinations of transport and land use policies on regional economic development, travel patterns and the environment in metropolitan areas using several European and urban/regional simulation models.

AB  - A thorough examination of the causes of land-use change is necessary to effectively deal with the magnitude of changes across the globe. Chihuahua, Mexico is experiencing rapid land-use changes due to processes of globalization. The emergence of Mexico's maquiladora program is an indicator of economic globalization that has had far-reaching social and environmental consequences. This article examines population and income patterns from 1970 to 2000 as part of a hierarchical system and tests whether or not processes of globalization can be detected in the patterns. Findings indicate that population and income concentrate primarily in Juarez, while simultaneously deconcentrating in most other municipios of the State. Moreover, these patterns correlate with patterns of maquiladora concentration. Additional findings identify proximity to the US and established urban centers as drivers of population concentration. These findings support the notion that patterns and processes of globalization are important drivers of population and income concentration at the local level in Chihuahua, Mexico. Finally, the findings support the conceptualization of population land-use and income concentration as part of a hierarchical system. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recent uneven land use dynamics in urban areas resulting from demographic change, economic pressure and the cities' mutual competition in a globalising world challenge both scientists and practitioners, among them social scientists, modellers and spatial planners. Processes of growth and decline specifically affect the urban environment, the requirements of the residents on social and natural resources. Social and environmental research is interested in a better understanding and ways of explaining the interactions between society and landscape in urban areas. And it is also needed for making life in cities attractive, secure and affordable within or despite of uneven dynamics. The position paper upon "Actors and factors - bridging social science findings and urban land use change modeling" presents approaches and ideas on how social science findings on the interaction of the social system (actors) and the land use (factors) are taken up and formalised using modelling and gaming techniques. It should be understood as a first sketch compiling major challenges and proposing exemplary solutions in the field of interest.

AB  - Land-use change can be regarded as changing a certain type of land use into the use of other types, also be seen as a piece of land from "undeveloped state" into a "development state." However, the land itself does not self-developed, so the actual land-use decision-making behavior depends on the choices of land developers. This study, based on the relationship between actor's decision-making behavior and land-use changes, collects GIS data of land uses, land price, population, urban planning and so forth, transforms them into 50 by 50 meters square grid, and then using NetLogo with Cellular Automata (CA) function to simulate the land-use change in Tainan city. The empirical study area is the reconsolidated area of the fifth period in Tainan city, Taiwan. The study period is 1989-2016 years which the period of estimating the land-use changing model is 1989-2006 and the forecasting period is 2007-2016. This study finding shows that it is useful to control the population density and land use intensity when making urban plan planning. Furthermore, the results and processes of LUCC simulation can be employed as assessments before land construction planning and development; it also provides land use planners useful references.

AB  - At present, environmental issues associated with rapid economic development are becoming critical concerns that arouse government's and people's particular attention. A large amount of influencing factors and especially their complicated interactions have always thrown confused insights into assessing the dynamic evolvement and sustainable development of urban economy-resource- environment (ERE) system and programming the developing strategies. A combination of system dynamics (SD) and geographic information system (GIS) is expected to explicitly understand the synergic interaction and feedback among a variety of influencing factors in time and space, since SD model can extend the spatial analysis functions of GIS to realize both dynamic simulation and trend prediction of an ERE system development. According to connotation and framework of sustainable development, this study proposes a dynamic combination method of SD-GIS to model and evaluate the urban development in Chongqing city of China suffering from depletion of resource and degradation of environment. To compare different policy inclinations with regard to potential ERE effects, typical scenarios (current, resource, technology and environment scenarios) are designed by adjusting the parameters in the model and changing the specification of some variables. Integrated assessment results indicate that the current ERE system of Chongqing is not sustainable; environment scenario is more effective to sustainable development of urban ERE system in a long run. Under the considerations of development features and regional differences, as well as regular discipline on urbanization, a coordinated combination of environmental, resource and technology scenarios is anticipated to realize sustainable development of urban ERE system.

AB  - There are manyadvantages of applying cellular automata (CA) models to urban systems: realism, spatiality, resolution, presentation, and links with geographic information systems. The CA lattice can be generalized to represent urban spatial structures, networks of accessibility, or the physical infrastructure of the city. Not surprisingly, CA and the patterns that they generate exhibit many idiosyncrasies of complex adaptive systems, such as phase shifts, power laws, self-organization, self-similarity, and fractal dimensions. Spatial relationships, such as topologies and networks, are crutial parts of a GIS database. Topology is employed to manage common boundaries between features, define and enforce data integrity rules, and support topological queries and navigation (for example, to determine feature adjacency and connectivity). Topology is also used to support sophisticated editing and to construct features from unconstructed geometry (for example, to construct polygons from lines). Networks describe a connected graph of GIS objects that can be traversed. This is important for modeling pathways and navigation for transportation, utilities, and many other network-based applications. Practically, CA and GIS have several generalities indeed. First link between CA models and GIS can be observed on an initial stage of the modeling: CA pattem and raster data are cell-based (pixels). Second one is spatial relationships that depends on local connections. Third and the most promising link is that integrating them we can get more information about urban system development. As an example, we take a small raster drawing from GIS, use it in our Urban CA Model (URBACAM) as a pattern, reach relevant proportions; make some simulations and analysis.

Hanoi province, Vietnam was selected for the case study. Transformation of conventional agriculture to modern cash crops is the current trend in peri-urban Hanoi. A field survey with focused group discussions was conducted. Based on field survey data analysis, soil, land use, water resources, road network and market were chosen as major factors affecting the peri-urban agriculture. A map of each factor with different logical criteria was prepared. The AHP method was applied to identify the priority weight of each factor. Five spatial layers with their corresponding weights were linearly combined to prepare the suitability map. The map was further scaled as high suitable, medium suitable, low suitable and unsuitable land for the peri-urban agriculture. This empirical scenario provides a cost effective, rapid land evaluation framework which may help policy makers, urban and regional planners and researchers working in developing countries. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The challenging question is whether this choice increases the general political objective of sustainable development. In this context, also the land-use and transportation interfaces have to be envisaged. This paper aims to offer a methodological/operational contribution to sustainable mobility policy in the Naples metropolitan area (in the Campania Region, Italy). Scenario analysis is used to design combined land-use/transportation plans to be assessed from a sustainability perspective. Long-range choice options are evaluated using inter alia a sophisticated multicriteria analysis (i.e., hierarchical Regime method). Sensitivity analyses will test the robustness of policy rank order solutions found by the above multicriteria analysis.

AB  - This paper implements a land use classification for the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, using an object-oriented approach for six Landsat TM and ETM+ images and simulates the land use pattern in the future using Markov Chain analysis and Cellular Automata analysis based on the interactions between these land uses and the transportation network. Shannon's Entropy (an urban sprawl index) based on the land use classification results is used to measure urban sprawl. This research proves that an object-oriented approach can produce satisfactory classification results. It reveals the manner in which land use is likely to develop in the future, and demonstrates that urban sprawl continued to grow in Calgary during the years between 1985 and 2001. Such models are useful for providing the building blocks for traditional four-step transportation planning models. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (Îº) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Praxitele project is responsible for the design of a new kind
of transportation in an urban environment, which consists of a fleet of
electric public cars. The realization of such a project requires
experimentations with the behaviour of autonomous vehicles in the urban
environment. It was necessary to design a virtual urban environment in
which simulations could be done. Reproducing the real traffic of a city
as completely as possible, implies the simulation of autonomous entities
like living beings. Such entities are able to perceive their
environment, to communicate with other creatures and to execute some
actions either on themselves or on their environment. Interactions
between an object and its environment are, most of the time, very
simple: sensors and actuators are reduced to minimal capabilities which
permit them only to avoid obstacles in a 2D or 3D world. This is due to
the fact that databases for virtual environments are often confined to
the geometric level, when they must also contain physical, topological
and semantic information. Accordingly, we propose a model which is
designed to connect different levels of representation, by assembling
geometric, topological and semantic data in the field of traffic
simulation, and its implementation in VUEMS, a Modelling System of Urban
Road Network. From real world data (when available), we construct a
model of the virtual urban environment, integrating all the information

AB  - Development has ended isolation in many parts of Kalimantan, Indonesia, and provides previously isolated communities with the opportunity for greater involvement in a market economy. This paper describes the use of a simulation model to study the possible impacts of greater involvement in cash cropping in swidden agricultural systems. The model uses both individual-based and rule-based modelling approaches. The model formulation is based on a previous report of the social structure, culture and agricultural production system of the Kantu' in West Kalimantan [Dove, M.R., 1985. Swidden Agriculture in Indonesia: The Subsistence Strategies of the Kalimantan Kantu'. Mouton Publishers, Berlin]. The model simulates: (1) births, deaths, marriage, household formation and dissolution; (2) land use decisions on the type, number and location of swidden cultivation; and (3) tracks the consequences of those decisions at a landscape level as well as the economic welfare of the households. The model deals with swidden cultivation of rice and the planting and tapping of rubber. The paper presents a simulation 'experiment' that compares different land use strategies under a scenario of fluctuating rubber price. An important finding is that maintaining swidden cultivation as 'an option' in the farming system, rather than permanently replacing swidden cultivation with cash cropping, appears to be a safer strategy to moderate the impact of commodity price fluctuations

AB  - Although the concept of Ã¢â¬Ëland use planningÃ¢â¬â¢ is now firmly enmeshed in American urban planning, its meaning still remains vague. This paper aims to clarify the meaning by examining the historical development of land use planning in the USA. At the beginning of the twentieth century, city planners viewed a city as an organic unit of public facilities. While city planning thereafter provided potential elements of land use planning, such as zoning, zoning surveys and land use classification systems, the idea of land use planning itself was actually derived from rural county planning and was initially utilized in urban county planning as a guide for zoning in the 1930s. After bringing about a change in the way cities were viewed, that is, as a pattern of land use and population density, land use planning was further employed as a guide for urban redevelopment policies in the 1940s, and finally reaching full integration into city planning in the 1950s and 1960s.

In order to assess market, an assessment framework is developed. A critical analysis of secondary data from official and non-official sources is done. Major changes since late 1980s in the institutional environment and subsequent results have been assessed. The findings reveal that the transfer of urban land use rights in China is gradually responding to an improved governance system. Institutional reforms have led to a steady improvement in indicators such as transparency, efficiency, and access to information. Nonetheless, the market has significant weaknesses in addressing equity issues, engaging stakeholders, tackling corruption and dealing with expropriations. In general, the paper finds that the efficiency and effectiveness of the urban land market largely depends not on the type of tenure regime per s??, but rather on the system of governance in place. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abstract.  This article uses the results from formal network analysis to test hypotheses about the character of Russia's post-communist transition, taking decision-making elites at the sub-national level as the unit of analysis. From the transition literature, the hypothesis generated is that city politics retains elements of its pre-democratic structure; from the urban regime theory, the hypothesis generated is that the elitesâ structure will show elements of convergence to a Western type, with the prominence of actors from the private sector. The data is drawn from a survey of elites in one city, Novosibirsk, undertaken in 1997. The results show that the membership and structure of the network has some similar characteristics to a Western city. Rather than being purely dominated by bureaucratic elites, the private sector plays a role. The private sector actors are grouped with the public sector actors, though they are not, however, equal partners to the networks as its members do not appear among the most networked in the city. We conclude that the legacy of the past may not be as much a constraint as the transition literature supposes.

AB  - The fragmentation of construction land due to decentralised urban development, disorderly mixed land use, and large-scale transportation infrastructure poses a threat to urban integrity. There is a need to quantify the fragmentation level in a consistent way for inclusion in planning-related decisions. In the context of China's urban sprawl, this study develops a quantitative and intuitive index approach that planners can use to analyse multiple fragmentation features of construction land within urban areas. The approach can be used in planning policy reviews for timely land-use assessment and can be integrated into urban planning processes for developing strategic land-use scenarios. The method was applied in Shunde, a typical urban area in southern China, and construction-land fragmentation and its impacts on environmental quality were analysed. The results show that the entire built-up area in Shunde displays a high level of fragmentation. Patches of industrial and rural residence have been identified specifically higher fragmentation level. The shortage of available construction land makes land consolidation within built-up areas very important in planning Shunde's future development. Moreover, the land shortage requires the progressive reduction of construction land fragmentation. The results of the study also indicate that although land fragmentation has been affected by transportation infrastructure and the existence of rivers and hills in this region, decentralised decisions from hierarchical local governance regimes have greatly exacerbated this situation.

AB  - Population growth and redistribution generate urban development in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties throughout the USA. This paper presents an analysis of population growth and urban development within a non-metropolitan county in southeastern New York State. Land use data for a 30 km by 50 km study area were integrated with ancillary physiographic data in a raster geographic information system. Spatial analysis of these data revealed that urban land uses increased from 6.7% of the landscape in 1968 to 17.8% in 1985, resulting in an expansion in urban land area that was eight times faster than the increase in population. The number of urban patches, or contiguous urban areas, decreased from 936 to 829, although the average size of the urban patches increased from 9.4 to 25.4 ha. The majority of the new urban land was residential development located between 3 and 25 km from the central business districts of the villages and cities within the landscape. Spatially dispersed urban development generates incremental landscape changes that typically contribute to environmental degredation. Land use policies designed to protect environmental quality in urbanizing landscapes should focus, therefore, on accomplishing at least three objectives: (1) minimize further fragmentation of the ecological infrastructure; (2) restore, where practical, severed linkages in the ecological infrastructure; and (3) guide new development to locations near existing urban centers. If any of these objectives are to be met in the adversarial legal and political milieu of the USA, policy makers must devise land use controls that do not constitute a [`]taking' of private property. This paper argues that effective rural land use controls will not be widely implemented, or successfully withstand legal challenges, until empirical research demonstrates that land use spatial patterns directly affect both environmental quality and human quality of life, and that unregulated land markets in urbanizing landscapes encourage land use changes that inevitably degrade environmental quality.

AB  - In an earlier paper, the authors proposed that three components of urban land consumption be recognized in measuring urban land consumption: direct; indirect visible; and indirect less visible urban land uses. The indirect less visible uses are those that are present because of a nearby urban center, but which are not directly identifiable as urban, i.e., they are often difficult to distinguish visually from rural land uses. The indirect less visible component is comprises of two land use categories: the first is land used by exurbanites; the other is termed 'transitional land.' The latter category includes land that has not been built upon but which has started through the processes associated with urban development. This article describes a method for estimating the amount of land in the transitional category and applies the method in two study ares.

AB  - Selecting, locating, and managing trees to provide ecosystem services are becoming increasingly important facets of municipal and consulting forestry. The science of urban tree growth modeling is fundamental to quantifying these services. This paper describes three long-term tree growth studies conducted to evaluate tree performance because repeated measurements of the same trees produce critical data for growth model calibration and validation. Several empirical and process-based approaches to modeling tree growth are reviewed. Modeling is more advanced in the fields of forestry and pomology than in urban forestry. The USDA Forest Service's reference city research has developed over 1,800 growth equations from measurements on more than 17,000 trees in 16 cities. The database is a valuable source of information that reflects regional differences in species composition, climate, soils, site conditions, and management practices. Several examples illustrate how differences in local climate and management practices can influence growth of a single species and the resulting value of services. Further advances in urban tree growth modeling are needed to inform the design, management, and modeling of high performing landscapes. Â© 2012 International Society of Arboriculture.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of rapidly changing land use on erosion and sedimentation in a mixed land use watershed in the Ozark Highlands of the USA. The research combines a geographic information system-based soil erosion modeling approach with land use change detection to quantify the influence of changing land use on erosion risk. Five land use/land cover maps were generated or acquired for a 20-year period (1986 through 2006) at approximately 5-year intervals to assess land use change and to predict a projected (2030) land use scenario for the West Fork White River watershed in Northwest Arkansas. The Unit Stream Power based Erosion/Deposition model was applied to the observed and predicted land use to assess the impact on erosion. Total erosion from urban areas was predicted to increase by a factor of six between 1986 and 2030 based on the projected 2030 land use. Results support previous reports of increased urbanization leading to increased soil erosion risk. This study highlights the interaction of changes in land use with soil erosion potential. Soil erosion risk on a landscape can be quantified by incorporating commonly available biophysical data with geographic information system and remote sensing, which could serve as a land/watershed management tool for the rapid assessment of the effects of environmental change on erosion risk.

AB  - This paper presents a new method to simulate urban land-use changes by integrating adaptive genetic algorithms (AGA), cellular automata (CA) and GIS. Recently, cellular automata have been increasingly used to simulate land-use changes. The most important and difficult issue in the modeling process is to define and derive transition rules. Traditional logistic method has limitations for deriving the transition rules of CA models based on the assumption that the variables should be independent, which is not true in the actual situations. The limitations of logistic method can be overcome by using GA, which has a good global search capability in the parametric solution space and can find the best parameter combination. In this study, a CA model coupled with improved genetic algorithms is developed as AGA-CA model by Python behind the platform of ArcGIS to cope with the classic GA's disadvantages of easy premature convergence and low global optimal speed. The AGA-CA model is applied to simulate urban land-use of Suzhou city, a rapid urbanization area in the Yangtze River Delta in East China. The performance of the proposed model in simulating urban land-use is compared with that of the logistic-CA model. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the logistic calibrated CA models. Additionally, coupling Python with GIS provides a new way and short-cut for the simulation of land-use changes based on CA model.

AB  - A condensed history of urban modeling is presented to alert the reader to the vast literature that exists on the subject and to place Forrester's Urban Dynamics model in perspective. The influence of the export and service concept is found to be pervasive. With the changing context for urban analysis, the major issues appear to have shifted from that of how to accommodate growth through land allocation process. Among the higher priority issues are concerns with equity and environmental quality, the increasing complexity in client-sponsor relations, the need for better policies for operations as well as investments, and the design of meaningful information systems. To complement the other papers in this special issue, suggestions are made to modify or augment urban dynamics by the use of subjective probabilities; the use of empirical feedback to reduce uncertainties and imperfection of knowledge in urban system behavior; the inclusion of explicit values in the construction of a diversity of urban models used together in a gaming process; and the consideration of projecting structural changes in the urban model as a function of changes in values, institutions, and technology.

AB  - Geographic information processing and visualization on new types of platform such as mobile environment or web environment has been regarded as one of industrial and academic issues. For this, the various approaches for mobile GIS and Web GIS are being carried out on the application level. Motivation of this study is on system architecture and a prototype implementation for 3D mobile and Web 3D application. Platforms and devices for mobile 3D GIS technology manipulating geographic data and information provide some limitation to design and implement: limited CPU and memory, absence or limited performance of graphic accelerators, small size of display panel, and so on. Moreover, in the urban application, 3D spatial information is crucial for complex feature modeling. Core functions of mobile 3D GIS by feature-based approach was designed as some modules: data model and design of spatial features, editing and manipulating of 3D landscape objects, generating of geometrically complex type features, supporting of both database and file system, handling of attributes for 3D objects, texture mapping of complex types of 3D objects and digital elevation model with image library containing high resolution satellite imagery. With these functions, an integrated urban 3D modeling and rendering system was implemented using standard mobile 3D graphic API (application programming interface), OPENGL|ES (Open GL for embedded system), with MS EVC 4.0 MFC. As well as this mobile 3D design and implementation, multiple types of geographic features or objects encoded by GML (geography markup language) for the XML-databases building are taken into account of practical applicability for 3D urban approaches.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe the process through which climate change scenarios were downscaled in an urban land use model and the results of this experimentation. The land use models (Urban Growth Model [UGM] and the Land Cover Deltatron Model [LCDM]) utilized in the project are part of the SLEUTH program which uses a probabilistic cellular automata protocol. The land use change scenario experiments were developed for the 31-county New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) of the US Mid-Atlantic Region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 scenarios) were used to define the narrative scenario conditions of future land use change. The specific research objectives of the land use modeling work involving the SLEUTH program were threefold: (1) Define the projected conversion probabilities and the amount of rural-to-urban land use change for the NYMR as derived by the UGM and LCDM for the years 2020 and 2050, as defined by the pattern of growth for the years 1960-1990; (2) Down-scale the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as a narrative that could be translated into alternative growth projections; and, (3) Create two alternative future growth scenarios: A2 scenario which will be associated with more rapid land conversion than found in initial projections, and a B2 scenario which will be associated with a slower level of land conversion. The results of the modeling experiments successfully illustrate the spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for the years 2020 and 2050. The application of these results into the broader scale climate and health impact study is discussed, as is the general role of land use/land cover change models in climate change studies and associated environmental management strategies.

AB  - The paper explores a framework combining remote sensing and spatial metrics aimed at improving the analysis and modeling of urban growth and land use change. While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales.

AB  - China's urbanization has resulted in significant changes in both agricultural land and agricultural land use. However, there is limited understanding about the relationship between the two primary changes occurring to China's agricultural land - the urban expansion on agricultural land and agricultural land use intensity. The goal of this paper is to understand this relationship in China using panel econometric methods. Our results show that urban expansion is associated with a decline in agricultural land use intensity. The area of cultivated land per capita, a measurement about land scarcity, is negatively correlated with agricultural land use intensity. We also find that GDP in the industrial sector negatively affects agricultural land use intensity. GDP per capita and agricultural investments both positively contribute to the intensification of agricultural land use. Our results, together with the links between urbanization, agricultural land, and agricultural production imply that agricultural land expansion is highly likely with continued urban expansion and that pressures on the country's natural land resources will remain high in the future.

AB  - As many local and state governments in the United States grapple with increasing growth pressures, the need to understand the economic and institutional factors underlying these pressures has taken on added urgency. From an economic perspective, individual land use decisions play a central role in the manifestation of growth pressures, as changes in land use pattern are the cumulative result of numerous individual decisions regarding the use of lands. In this study, the issue of growth management is addressed by developing a spatially disaggregated, microeconomic model of land conversion decisions suitable for describing residential land use change at the rural-urban fringe. The model employs parcel-level data on land use in Calvert County, Maryland, a rapidly growing rural-urban fringe county. A probabilistic model of residential land use change is estimated using a duration model, and the parameter estimates are employed to simulate possible future growth scenarios under alternative growth management scenarios. Results suggest that âsmart growthâ objectives are best met when policies aimed at concentrating growth in target areas are implemented in tandem with policies designed to preserve rural or open space lands.

The assessment of land development is important for minimizing development impacts and formulating alternative development plans. Much attention has been paid to the quantity of land use changes in general development assessment using remote sensing. However, additional information can be obtained from remote sensing and GIS for revealing land use problems more effectively. This paper presents four indicators, quantity, quality, location, and morphology,to characterize land development patterns for fast-growing regions. A four-component efficiency index is further developed for ranking purposes to reflect economic and environmental considerations. The implementation of the method has been demonstrated in a fast-growing region in south China. Efforts have been made to verify the model with independent empirical data

In the empirical analysis of the convergence processes we consider the effects of interactions among neighbouring regions implementing spatial econometrics techniques. We conclude that both the EU-15 and the new member states (NMS) experienced absolute regional income convergence during the EU pre-enlargement period. When national effects were included into convergence equations, there was no evidence for conditional convergence neither between EU-15 nor NMS regions. The results of the analysis indicate that EU regional policy should focus on overall cohesion by improving conditions for regional income convergence particularly within the member states.

In all scenarios, urban growth arises from the increase in population particularly, due to tourism and economic change. However, the spatial patterns are different due to alternative assumptions about urban development processes/purposes. The results of modelling are successfully illustrated in a spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for year 2020.

AB  - Urbanization has profoundly transformed many landscapes throughout the world, and the ecological consequences of this transformation are yet to be fully understood. To understand the ecology of urban systems, it is necessary to quantify the spatial and temporal patterns of urbanization, which often requires dynamic modeling and spatial analysis. In this paper, we describe an urban growth model, the Phoenix Urban Growth Model (PHX- UGM), illustrate a series of model calibration and evaluation methods, and present scenario-based simulation analyses of the future development patterns of the Phoenix metropolitan region. PHX-UGM is a spatially explicit urban landscape model and is a modified version of the Human-Induced Land Transformations (HILT) model originally developed for the San Francisco Bay Area. Using land use and other data collected for the Phoenix area, existing growth rules were selectively modified and new rules were added to help examine key ecological and social factors. We used multiple methods and a multi-scale approach for model calibration and evaluation. The results of the different evaluation methods showed that the model performed reasonably well at a certain range of spatial resolutions (120â480 m). When fine-scale data are available and when landscape structural details are desirable, the 120-m grain size should be used. However, at finer levels the noise and uncertainty in input data and the exponentially increased computational requirements would considerably reduce the usefulness and accuracy of the model. At the other extreme, model projections with too coarse a spatial resolution would be of little use at the local and regional scales. A series of scenario analyses suggest that the Metropolitan Phoenix area will soon be densely populated demographically and highly fragmented ecologically unless dramatic actions are to be taken soon to significantly slow down the population growth. Also, there will be an urban morphological threshold over which drastic changes in certain aspects of landscape pattern occur. Specifically, the scenarios indicate that, as large patches of open lands (including protected lands, parks and available desert lands) begin to break up, patch diversity declines due partly to the loss of agricultural lands, and the overall landscape shape complexity also decreases because of the predominance of urban lands. It seems that reaching such a threshold can be delayed, but not avoided, if the population in the Phoenix metropolitan region continues to grow. PHX-UGM can be used as a tool for exploring the outcome of different urban planning strategies, and the methods illustrated in this paper can be used for evaluating other urban models.

AB  - Where to get data for urban planning and management is one issue, but how to manage these data is still a challenging task. This article focuses on the technical issue of managing data. The core data for urban planning are land-use data, which, if updated frequently, raises the issue of structuring, storing, querying, and displaying the data. Modeling, querying, and displaying changes in land-use data have been a challenge for many designers and urban planners. We propose a novel approach to model land-use changes based on object-oriented concepts and a mathematical theory of cell complexes. For object-oriented concepts, the Unified Modeling Language is used. Each land use is considered as an object. This object is an instance of the SpatioTemporalAttributeClass, which is the aggregation of SpatialClass, TemporalClass, and AttributeClass. The AttributeClass is a metaclass of LanduseClass and EvidenceClass. This article focuses on the AttributeClass (land use). The two types of land uses considered here are detailed and general land use. Detailed land use is recorded at the parcel level, while general land use does not require parcel information. Parcel-level land use is indispensable for many operational and strategic planning exercises. An object-relational approach is employed to achieve the model at the logical level. This approach may help alleviate the accessibility problem of land-use data in an urban environment. Through Structured Query Language, it is demonstrated how the spatiotemporal queries can be made.

AB  - Declining water quality in the Chesapeake Bay estuary is in part the result of disruptions in the hydrological system caused by urban and suburban development throughout its 167000 km(2) watershed. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for a wide range of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km(2) area centered on the Washington - Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) ecologically sustainable growth. The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application.

AB  - Upgrading the SLEUTH urban-growth and land-use-change model, realizing its full capability in modeling change simultaneously in land-use and land-cover types, and using it as a self-organizing dynamic land-use planning tool have been the three main objectives of this study. In doing so, SLEUTH was applied to design a better plan for future and assess two scenarios concerning land-use and land-cover changes in Gorgan Township of the Golestan Province of Iran. Four land-use and land-cover maps were derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery through a hybrid method including unsupervised, supervised, and on-screen classification for four years. To provide a more desirable forecast of future land-use and land-cover changes, SLEUTHâs exclusion layer was combined with an urbanization-suitability layer from a multicriteria evaluation (MCE) using fifteen map layers that most influence land suitability for urban development. The layers used in the MCE process were related to landform, vegetation, soil and geology, and surrogate socioeconomic factors; hence, they portrayed the desirability of the urban growth. SLEUTH was used for forecasting with both this new and a standard exclusion layer. Using the new layer, the fragmentation of the future land-use pattern was controlled and urban development along roads was restrained, thereby safeguarding the remaining urban green space and remnant rural vegetation patches. The results were also compared with a separate site selection process for future urban development showing the desirability of MCE-guided SLEUTH modeling over original SLEUTH and the standalone urban MCE in terms of landform, surrogate socioeconomic factors, and landscape metrics such as patch size, shape, and proximity and fractal dimension. As SLEUTH derives change rules simultaneously for different land-use and land-cover types in a self-modifying self-organizing manner, we showed the approach can be regarded as a tool for dynamic land-use planning.

AB  - China launched an ambitious urban land-use reform to improve land-use efficiency, raise funds for infrastructure construction, and facilitate foreign investment in the late 1980s. Few studies have systematically evaluated the effects of the market mechanisms on land-use changes in Chinese cities. This paper takes the city of Beijing as a case study to quantify the magnitude of land-use changes and model it in relation to spatial and market drivers through time and across the metropolitan region. The analysis uses unique district-level land survey data from 1992, 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008, as well as land granting records. Analysis reveals that, since the urban land market was established in 1992, the spatial pattern of land uses has changed dramatically in Beijing, land price has exerted a significantly influence on land-use conversion, and the municipal recognition of an open market for land assets has set the spatialâtemporal pattern of land uses on a course that sharply differs from past trends in Beijing.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for generating semi-automated 3D models of urban area from multiple high- resolution satellite images. Adoption of Rational Function Models (RFM's) during recent years as a replacement for satellite's rigorous sensor model by many commercial imagery providers makes 3D information extraction fast and reliable for most of end-users. This paper presents an application of RFM in generating 3D terrain models, i.e. bear-ground models void of any vegetation and man-made objects, as well as 3D surface modeling (surface models with man-made objects). A fast one- dimensional terrain-dependent object-based search technique for identifying correspondences in multiple images followed by a refined 2D search to obtain an optimal correspondence match is introduced. Corresponding objects are then used in conjunction with the RFM to generate 3D model of the area. Example of correspondence matching and a 3D model generated for a selected area of Yokohama, Japan using QuickBird stereo images is presented.

AB  - This paper describes a type of project that images a city as it might exist given the integration of hemostatic procedures within pedestrian networks during emergencies requiring full-scale egress from an urban core. It articulates the steps taken to integrate a pre-existing C++ hemostasis model (C. Jacob, 2008) into Maya software in order to describe how the project operates on a computational level. By projecting these agent-based logics directly into/onto each pedestrian in the city (the smallest unit of the system), egress-oriented infrastructure can shift from being extensively predetermined in form (concrete barriers, metal railing, police barricades, etc.), to something more intensively defined, real-time, and locally on-demand. These procedures are situated within a larger schema based on the structural principles of Norbert Wiener's cybernetic feedback loops, that acknowledge and allow for hybrid (top-down + bottom-up) awareness and control within systems. The project attempts to ally itself with emerging forms of network design with similar structural typologies supported through the use of personal mobile devices (PMDs) in urban environments.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the factors responsible for residential and industrial/commercial land development in Lagos between 1984 and 2000. Land use changes were mapped using satellite images, while binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing urban development as a function of spatially explicit independent variables. Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land area.s. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

AB  - Urban growth patterns are characteristic of spatial changes that take place in metropolitan areas (MA). They are particularly prominent in more recently formed MAs, such as those in certain locations in Spain, where the structure of the traditional city has undergone sweeping changes. Given the capacity of spatial metrics to characterize landscape structure, these metrics can be a valuable instrument to identify growth patterns in MAs and to evaluate possible urban growth options, based on spatial characteristics. This article focuses on a medium-sized MA (Granada, Spain), and explores the use of spatial metrics to quantify changes in the urban growth patterns reflected in three future scenarios (2020). The scenarios were simulated with a model based on cellular automata, which reproduced three urban growth processes (aggregation, compaction, and dispersion) and four urban growth patterns (aggregated, linear, leapfrogging, and nodal). The scenarios were evaluated with metrics that quantified changes in the spatial characteristics of urban processes. Thus, for example, the NP and AREA MN allowed us to characterize the decreased aggregation of high-density residential land uses in one scenario (S1) and the linear growth patterns in industrial land uses in another scenario (S2). In this way, spatial metrics were found to be useful for the evaluation of urban planning.

The role which agriculture will play depends on careful social cost/effectiveness studies of the alternative uses of land. It will be necessary to forecast land use requirements for the expansion of transportation networks, recreation areas and urban development. This paper explores the potential of using scenario planning as a tool for land allocation decisions regarding agricultural usages and urban development in Israel.

AB  - We present empirical evidence that land values are scale free and introduce a network model that reproduces the observations. The network approach to urban modeling is based on the assumption that the market dynamics that generates land values can be represented as a growing scale-free network. Our results suggest that the network properties of trade between specialized activities cause land values, and likely also other observables such as population, to be power-law distributed. In addition to being an attractive avenue for further analytical inquiry, the network representation is also applicable to empirical data and is thereby attractive for predictive modeling.

AB  - Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate statistical framework that is used to model complex relationships between directly and indirectly observed (latent) variables. SEM is a general framework that involves simultaneously solving systems of linear equations and encompasses other techniques such as regression, factor analysis, path analysis, and latent growth curve modeling. Recently, SEM has gained popularity in the analysis of complex genetic traits because it can be used to better analyze the relationships between correlated variables (traits), to model genes as latent variables as a function of multiple observed genetic variants, and assess the association between multiple genetic variants and multiple correlated phenotypes of interest. Though the general SEM framework only allows for the analysis of independent observations, recent work has extended SEM for the analysis of general pedigrees. Here, we review the theory of SEM for both unrelated and family data, the available software for SEM, and provide an example of SEM analysis.

AB  - The Chinese economy has experienced substantial development over the last thirty years. This growth has resulted in an enormous expansion of China's urban areas and it has also led to a growing scarcity of land resources. Consequently, there is currently an urgent need to mitigate the conflict between the needs of growing urban areas and the shrinking supply of land resources. Understanding land-use intensity and its changes can provide important information to find mitigating measures for this conflict in the demand for land. Previous studies have found that increasing the utilization efficiency of land resources is one of the most effective ways to resolve this issue. This study focuses on the city of Guangzhou, which is an intensively developed megalopolis. A number of different data sources have been analyzed to find the characteristics and changes in urban land use in Guangzhou, including: Landsat data from 1979, 1990, 2000, and 2009; relative socioeconomic data from the Guangzhou statistic yearbooks; and the master plans of Guangzhou. The results indicate that the area of developed land has continued to increase. Urban development land intensity and its change were then explored using a Back Propagation neural network model of the city. Although the analysis revealed that urban development land did not have a higher intensity overall, it also showed that there was a sectional upward trend throughout the study period. Consequently, there is a potential to improve the land-use intensity of Guangzhou. A linear regression model was then adopted to explore the mechanism of land use change. The results reveal that rapid industrialization and urbanization have improved land-use intensity in Guangzhou. The per capita urban road area and per capita GDP show a strong relationship when compared with land-use intensity. Using the relative city master plans, the authors have argued that local government in Guangzhou has taken active steps to address land issues to promote the city's socioeconomic development; however, a scientific city master plan in the study area is still necessary to ensure the effective utilization of the city's limited land resources. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Rather than a bad case of urban sprawl, the physical expansion of China's megacities may be viewed as a combination of 'urban spill over' and 'local urban sprawl'. This paper reviews land use regulations in their institutional context and argues that conflicts in land use regulation are related to ideologies of land ownership and embedded in different planning doctrines. These hypotheses are investigated with special reference to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. The evidence suggests that entangled land use regulations for "urban" and "rural" land have imposed serious constraints on urban growth, while the contradictions of different policies and regulations in the use of rural lands for urban construction have led to intensive and unhealthy competition among stakeholders. As a result, not only have the costs of land conversion from rural to urban uses increased, but the spatial development of Guangzhou has been distorted. The implications of these failures for future policy are discussed with emphasis on the reform of the land use regulation system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An increasing number of models for predicting land use change in regions of rapid urbanization are being proposed and built using ideas from cellular automata (CA) theory. Calibrating such models to real situations is highly problematic and to date, serious attention has not been focused on the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a structure for simulating urban change based on estimating land use transitions using elementary probabilistic methods which draw their inspiration from Bayes' theory and the related âweights of evidenceâ approach. These land use change probabilities drive a CA model â DINAMICA â conceived at the Center for Remote Sensing of the Federal University of Minas Gerais (CSR-UFMG). This is based on an eight cell Moore neighborhood approach implemented through empirical land use allocation algorithms. The model framework has been applied to a medium-size town in the west of SÃ£o Paulo State, Bauru. We show how various socio-economic and infrastructural factors can be combined using the weights of evidence approach which enables us to predict the probability of changes between land use types in different cells of the system. Different predictions for the town during the period 1979-1988 were generated, and statistical validation was then conducted using a multiple resolution fitting procedure. These modeling experiments support the essential logic of adopting Bayesian empirical methods which synthesize various information about spatial infrastructure as the driver of urban land use change. This indicates the relevance of the approach for generating forecasts of growth for Brazilian cities particularly and for world-wide cities in general.

AB  - Land-use change models grounded in complexity theory such as agent- based models (ABMs) are increasingly being used to examine evolving urban systems. The objective of this study is to develop a spatial model that simulates land-use change under the influence of human land-use choice behavior. This is achieved by integrating the key physical and social drivers of land-use change using Bayesian networks (BNs) coupled with agent-based modeling. The BNAS model, integrated Bayesian networkâbased agent system, presented in this study uses geographic information systems, ABMs, BNs, and influence diagram principles to model population change on an irregular spatial structure. The model is parame- terized with historical data and then used to simulate 20 years of future population and land-use change for the City of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. The simu- lation results identify feasible new urban areas for development around the main transportation corridors. The obtained new development areas and the projected population trajectories with theââwhat-ifââ scenario capabilities can provide insights into urban planners for better and more informed land-use policy or decision- making processes.

AB  - A dynamic model of the urban land and building market is proposed which explicitly incorporates endogenous spatial externalities. Using stochastic optimization the model estimates for each period first the supply of building space and then the spatial allocation of activities. Prices for buildings and land are endogenous. The development of the urban area depends on the demand for labor in basic industries. The dynamics of the system is controlled also by the lagged response to endogenous variables. Thus, both the level of externalities, which affect the allocation of activities, and rents, which influence the location of the building supply, are based on the results of the preceding period.

The model is used to test the outcomes of development policy scenarios and make forecasts. It consists of five sub-systems including population, economy, housing, transport and urban/developed land, respectively. Two distinctively different development schemes concerning urban population den- sity are simulated by the model and the findings are undertaken to verify the model through comparison with historical data and sensitivity check. The forecast timeframe is then expanded from 40 years to 300 years, providing a simulation period long enough to observe and study the ââlimits to growthââ phe- nomenon and the impacts on development potential of Hong Kong. The modelling results are directly useful to compare different dynamic consequences brought by various policies and decisions, and are thus of great significance to achieving the goal of sustainable land use.

AB  - The paper aims to position the concept of adaptive efficiency in planning theory, by providing insights on the conditions that explain why land use planning in some institutional contexts is able to adapt and improve more efficiently than in others. This is done by focusing on a specific planning goal: the control of residential sprawl. The paper presents a theoretical framework based on two models, one on the coordinating mechanisms regarding the use of land and one to explain institutional changes. This framework is exploited with empirical case studies where we compare the control of sprawl in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland. The analysis diagnoses a duality of planning practices. Even though planning failures occur in the Netherlands as well, we provide evidence that Dutch land use planning has been able to efficiently adapt regulatory instruments and collaborative practices to societal changes. By contrast, Belgian and Polish planners face huge difficulties to incorporate new initiatives to control urban sprawl or, in more general terms, to reinforce their influence on land uses. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban areas can contain rich flora that contribute significantly to biodiversity, but loss and isolation of habitats due to urban sprawl threaten biodiversity and warrant limits on development. The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - In this paper I build on current research in urban and ecological simulation modeling to develop a conceptual framework for modeling the urban ecosystem. Although important progress has been made in various areas of urban modeling, operational urban models are still primitive in terms of their ability to represent ecological processes. On the other hand, environmental models designed to assess the ecological impact of an urban region are limited in their ability to represent human systems. I present here a strategy to integrate these two lines of research into an urban ecological model (UEM). This model addresses the human dimension of the Puget Sound regional integrated simulation model (PRISM)âa multidisciplinary initiative at the University of Washington aimed at developing a dynamic and integrated understanding of the environmental and human systems in the Puget Sound. UEM simulates the environmental pressures associated with human activities under alternative demographic, economic, policy, and environmental scenarios. The specific objectives of UEM are to: quantify the major sources of human-induced environmental stresses (such as land-cover changes and nutrient discharges); determine the spatial and temporal variability of human stressors in relation to changes in the biophysical structure; relate the biophysical impacts of these stressors to the variability and spatial heterogeneity in land uses, human activities, and management practices; and predict the changes in stressors in relation to changes in human factors.

AB  - Between 3000 and 4000 people report being stung by scorpions each year in the Phoenix, AZ, metropolitan area, but the frequency of stings is not distributed evenly across the metropolitan area: certain areas consistently exhibit higher numbers of scorpion stings than the other parts of the city. I overlaid data from the Phoenix Samaritan Regional Poison Center about the number of scorpion stings per ZIP Code onto a Geographic Information System coverage of land use in the Phoenix metropolitan area. I then compared the types and amounts of land use among ZIP Codes that differed in the number of scorpion stings. The number and geographic location of scorpion stings in the Phoenix metropolitan area were reflected in the presence and abundance of some forms of urban land use. In particular, density of single-family homes and proximity to undeveloped open space were good predictors of the frequency of scorpion stings. These results may be useful to potential home-buyers by making them aware of areas that are at higher risk of scorpion encounters. This information may also be helpful to land use planners and developers in the cost-benefit analysis of deciding how and where future development in Phoenix should occur. One recommendation for future urban development is to consider how high-density housing (???6 dwellings per acre) may minimize human-scorpion encounters.

AB  - This article provides a critical review of the history of urban modeling in North America, with a focus on unraveling some fundamental issues that militated against incorporating the first-generation urban models into planning practice. After examining the underlying theoretical context in social practice, I demonstrate that the re-emergence of a different form of rationality creates the conditions for incorporating new forms of urban models. Finally, I highlight the developments in group decision support systems research and suggest how these systems, together with a geographic information systems component, can be designed for critical planning practice.

AB  - Although the concept of 'land use planning' is now firmly enmeshed in American urban planning, its meaning still remains vague. This paper aims to clarify the meaning by examining the historical development of land use planning in the USA. At the beginning of the twentieth century, city planners viewed a city as an organic unit of public facilities. While city planning thereafter provided potential elements of land use planning, such as zoning, zoning surveys and land use classification systems, the idea of land use planning itself was actually derived from rural county planning and was initially utilized in urban county planning as a guide for zoning in the 1930s. After bringing about a change in the way cities were viewed, that is, as a pattern of land use and population density, land use planning was further employed as a guide for urban redevelopment policies in the 1940s, and finally reaching full integration into city planning in the 1950s and 1960s.

AB  - Lake areas in Chinese urban fringes are under increasing pressure of urbanization. Consequently, the conflict between rapid urban sprawl and the maintenance of water bodies in such areas urgently needs to be addressed. An integrated GIS-based analysis system (IGAS) for supporting land-use management of lake areas in urban fringes was developed in this paper. The IGAS consists of modules of land-use suitability assessment and change/demand analysis, and land evaluation and allocation. Multicriteria analysis and system dynamics techniques are used to assess land-use suitability and forecast potential land-use variation, respectively. Cost approximation and hypothetical development methods are used to evaluate land resource and market values, respectively. A case study implementing the system was performed on the Hanyang Lake area in the urban fringe of Wuhan City, central China, which is under significant urbanization pressure. Five categories of suitability were investigated by analyzing 11 criteria and related GIS data. Two scenarios for potential land-use changes from 2006 to 2020 were predicted, based on a systematic analysis and system dynamics modeling, and a hierarchical land-use structure was designed for the conservation of aquatic ecosystems. The IGAS may help local authorities better understand and address the complex land-use system, and develop improved land-use management strategies that better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Land use planning is a potentially demanding search and optimization task that has been challenged by numerous researchers in the field of spatial planning. Agent and multi-agent systems are examples of the modern concepts, which have been gaining more attention in challenging spatial issues recently. Although the efficiency of belief, desire, and intention (BDI) architecture of agents is validated in varieties of sciences, its uses in Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and specifically among spatial planners is still burgeoning. In this paper, we attempted to integrate the concepts of BDI agent architecture into spatial issues; as a result, a novel spatial agent model is designed and implemented to analyze the urban land use planning. The proposed approach was checked in urban land use planning problems using a case study in a municipal area. The result of implementation showed the effects of spatial agents' behaviors such as intention, commitment, and interaction on their decision. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effective modeling of the urban landscape dynamics in a megalopolitan cluster area (MCA) is essential to understanding its spatial evolution process. However, existing urban landscape dynamic models based on cellular automata (CA) are limited in that they do not consider urban flows (e.g., flows of people, material, and information) between the different cities/towns in an MCA. This paper proposes a new megalopolitan landscape dynamic model (MLDM) that is better suited for simulating the urban landscapes in an MCA by combining a gravitational field model (GFM) with a CA model. The GFM was used to model the influence of inter-city urban flows and to refine the transition rules of the CA model. The MLDM was applied to simulate the urban landscape in the MCA of Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, and produced more accurate simulation results than the CA model that did not account for urban flows. The MLDM-based prediction of future landscapes suggested that urbanization will continue in the region through 2020, especially in a few 'hotspot' areas. Close attention should be paid to these areas for strategic regional planning and environmental protection in this heartland of China. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Urban land use has been a major driving force behind land use change in Estonia since regaining independence and land reform process in the 1990s. The study summarizes land use change, land management and planning practices in the urban fringe over a period of 20 years with the aim of introducing a sustainable land use policy in highly fragmented suburban land. The processes and dynamics of land use change are explored using cartographic and landscape metrics analysis. The liberal-conservative planning practices have resulted in ad hoc allocation solutions which have created dramatic changes in land use in Estonia during the 1990s and 2000s. The patchy and scattered suburban land is formed by occupying former agricultural land, natural grasslands and forests. In the framework of physical planning, the land use, spatial and urban changes are related to master plans. The nature of the evolution of land management and the deficiencies of institutional framework are discussed as factors in inefficient land use in the sprawling suburbs. A further debate on the feasibility of encouraging land use diversity in peri-urban zones is advocated. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use is a kind of important form that affects environment, especially in big city. If land use is not appropriate, and that result will destroy ecological environment, lead to land resource wasting, and will cause socio-economic problems. So, information acquiring of urban land use is one of the key issues of city planning. That is to say, how to monitor, manage and treat information on land use are all important for our zoning commission. As we all known, the precision and efficiency of traditional methods based on spectral feature is not high. One reason is that precision of the photos is low, so high quality results is not possible to acquire; the other reason is that the methods used by us are not high efficient, so we can not acquire satisfying results. In this paper, an unacquainted and small area named WuQi County (in Shaanxi Province) is as an example. Based on surveying the areas, a lot of RS images of these areas are get together. According to the spectral and spatial properties of information on urban land-use in the town and related knowledge, some new methods and technologies are used to RS images and urban land-use extraction with the support of manual work.

AB  - Photochemical modeling studies are undertaken for an area to find out the best means of controlling high ozone levels there. As a part of the photochemical modeling process, the entire area of study needs to be divided into small grids of equal sizes and total emissions of ozone precursors (NOx and VOC) from that area needs to be specified at the center of these grids. Previous studies by Brandmeyer et. al. (2000) and Kim et. al. (2000) have used GIS techniques for emissions allocation into different grids encompassing the study area. Currently a modeling study is being undertaken for the Corpus Christi urban airshed. This paper basically reports on the method, which was used for allocating emissions of ozone precursors from area and non-road sources into grid cells of the two counties of Nueces and San Patricio comprising the urban airshed of Corpus Christi using the geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Two GIS software namely, Arcview and Arcinfo were used in this study for allocation of these emissions and their subsequent visualization (ESRI, 1997a & 1997b).

AB  - Urban land-use planning and management are in constant mutation throughout the world. With sustainability as the goal, the use of indicators for land auditing and monitoring is becoming more and more in demand. Classical approaches elaborate core sets of indicators by picking the most relevant elements in exhaustive lists. More recently, a few structured research approaches consider the set of indicators as a whole, following the concepts of systernics, and so highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the sets. Starting from the principle that the relevance of an indicator is due not only to its intrinsic qualities, but also to its placement and relationships with the other indicators in the collection, this paper proposes a systemic method, named Relational Indicatorset Model (RIM), for the elaboration of a set of indicators for management support. The RIM method starts with the a priori definitions of the goals and users' purpose (RIM-objectives), and then chooses indicators to reflect the objectives on representing the distribution of indicators in a relational graph (RIM graph). The graph modeling allows analyzing the match between the indicatorset and the defined objectives, as well as the interrelationships between the indicators. The analysis is made easier by breaking down the RIM graph following two projections: the first one (RIM-4D) highlights the distribution of the indicators in a multidimensional graph with respect to the objectives; the second one (RIM-IR) focuses on the interrelationships and offers the possibility of formalizing the causal interactions and the aggregational relationships between the indicators, following a qualitative approach. The RIM is applied to the design of sets of spatial and non-spatial indicators for the cities of Thies (Senegal) and of Geneva (Switzerland) to emphasize the potential of the method. It opens up interesting possibilities for application to all sets of indicators for sustainable land-use development. It also contributes to the creation of observatories for city management, instruments used to monitor and control the urban sustainable development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The preservation of riparian zones and other environmentally sensitive areas has long been recognized as one of the most cost-effective methods of managing stormwater and providing a broad range of ecosystem services. In this research, a cellular automata (CA)-Markov chain model of land cover change was developed to integrate protection of environmentally sensitive areas into urban growth projections at a regional scale. The baseline scenario is a continuation of the current trends and involves only limited constraints on development. The green infrastructure (GI) conservation scenario incorporates an open space conservation network based on the functional boundaries of environmentally sensitive areas. It includes variable buffer widths for impaired streams (as identified on the USEPA 303d list for stream impairment), 100-year floodplain, wetlands, urban open space and steep slopes. Comparative analysis of each scenario with landscape metrics indicated that under the GI conservation scenario, the number of urban patches decreased while the extent of interspersion of urban land with green infrastructure patches increased leading to improved connectivity among open space features. The analysis provides a quantitative illustration of how our process contributes towards achieving urban planning objectives while incorporating green infrastructure. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Policy makers concerned with the peri-urban interface find their greatest challenges in the rapid urban growth of developing mountain regions, since limitations caused by relief and altitude often lead to an increased competition between rural and urban land use at the valley floors. In this context, little attention has been paid to the affected agriculturalists' perceptions of peri-urban growth-important information required for the realization of sustainable land use planning. How is the process of rural-urban land change perceived and assessed by peri-urban smallholder communities? Which are the major difficulties to be overcome? By what means are the affected people reacting and how are these adaptation strategies linked with the ongoing landscape transformations of the hinterland?By using the example of Huancayo Metropolitano, an emerging Peruvian mountain city, it is shown that rural-urban land change is intensively discussed within peri-urban smallholder groups. Although urbanization also leads to infrastructure investments by public institutions-an advantage perceived throughout the study area-the negative impacts of rural-urban land use change prevail. The perceptions' analysis reveals that the decrease of fertile and irrigated agricultural land at the quechua valley floor is especially considered to threaten subsistence, food and income security. In order to compensate the loss of production capacities, many smallholders try to expand or intensify their land use at the suni altitudinal belt: an agro-ecological zone characterized by steep and nonirrigated slopes that can actually not be used for the year-round production of crops previously cultivated at the quechua zone.

AB  - Owing to the urban logistics system was an uncertain, nonlinear, dynamic and complicated system, and it was difficult to describe it by traditional methods, a modeling and forecasting method of urban logistics demand based on improved simulated annealing neural network (ISANN) is presented in this paper. First the simulated annealing algorithm with the best reserve mechanism is introduced and it is organic combined with Powell algorithm to form improved simulated annealing mixed optimize algorithm, instead of gradient falling algorithm of BP network to train network weight. It can get higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. We construct the network structure, and give the algorithm flow. The main parameters of affecting urban logistics demand are studied. With the ability of strong self-learning and faster convergence of ISANN, the modeling and forecasting method can truly forecast the logistics demand. The actual forecasting results show that this method is feasible and effective.

AB  - Land-cover and land-use (LCLU) change was quantified for the last 35 years within and in the vicinity of a fast growing city in Mexico, using rectified aerial photographs and geographic information systems (GIS). LCLU change was projected for the next 20 years using Markov chains and regression analyses. The study explored the relationships between urban growth and landscape change, and between urban growth and population growth. The analysis of Markov matrices suggests that the highest LCLU attractor is the city of Morelia, followed by plantations and croplands. Grasslands and shrublands are the least stable categories. The most powerful use of the Markov transition matrices seems to be at the descriptive rather than the predictive level. Linear regression between urban and population growth offered a more robust prediction of urban growth in Morelia. Hence, we suggest that linear regression should be used when projecting growth tendencies of cities in regions with similar characteristics. Â© 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The effectiveness of the mapping and assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) in the identification of problem areas and in monitoring development policies makes it a suitable method in poverty studies. In an attempt to enhance QoL as a strategy for poverty alleviation decision-making, this research has adopted the analytical tool of Geographical Information System (GIS). Twelve indicators were used to assess the QoL of Egor Local Government Area (LGA), Edo State, Nigeria. These indicators were grouped into three different domains of life (social, economic and physical). Spatial autocorrelation check was performed on the indicators to determine the spatial prediction method that was used to map each indicator. Of all these indicators, only two were spatially auto-correlated. The two indicators were mapped using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The other indicators were mapped using the voronoi polygons. The twelve models were used to model and assess QoL with the utilization of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. The weights used for the combination of the various mapped indicators were given by the respondents. The QoL model was cross-validated using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation method. The result showed that the QoL of 61.53% of the geographic space of Egor LGA was below average, 17.94% was extremely poor, and 14.55% was average, while the classes above average and excellent were not on the QoL model. In addition, the research identified priority development areas and concluded that the QoL of the people of Egor LGA was poor and required urgent conscious intervention by all development partners including the government.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion â as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - Nowadays China has been soaked in the craze of planning and construct urban logistics park, and almost all developed countries all regard the urban logistics park's construction as a major motivation to the national economic. It is vital that the scientific planning of urban logistics park will ensure China's rapid development. However, too many inappropriate or unscientific planning and construction under the guidance of Government have brought giant economic loss to China. How to plan and design the urban logistics park scientifically, It is a hot topic of research being widely discussed not only by Governments but also enterprisers and scholars home and abroad. This paper begins with exploratory research for modeling and planning on the urban logistics park location selection based on the BP Artificial Neural Network (BP ANN). This paper divides into 3 sections: the first to mainly introduce the history of urban logistics park development and the significance of modelling and planning urban logistics park, the second to analyze basic principle of the BP ANN, the third to simulate and plan the location selection of urban logistics park based on the BP ANN model. The urban logistics park's location selection planning is a complicated and dynamical system engineering with a lot of black box problems, which can't be resloved by System Dynamics, Expert System and traditional mathematical methods (e.g. Operations Research, Statistics), and BP ANN model has seldom been applied to plan urban logistics park in China.

AB  - Abstract The process of urban land use change is influenced by the interactions of various stakeholders who have conflicting values and priorities. These interactions, which are characterized by a strong competition for advantageous land locations, can be represented by an agent-based model in order to better understand, analyze and forecast possible future urban land use patterns. The objective of this study is to develop and implement Agent iCity, an agent-based model that simulates the process of urban land-use change by using irregular spatial units at a cadastral scale and by incorporating the interactions of the key stakeholders. The simulation outcomes are generated for two scenarios of the process of urban land use change as it occurs under the conditions of different urban growth policies. The model is implemented on municipal cadastral and land use data for part of the City of Chilliwack, Canada, a city that has experienced rapid growth in the last decade. The results indicate that that relative household incomes and property values drive the changes in urban land use patterns as households search for affordable homes in suitable neighbourhoods. The developed Agent iCity model can assist urban planners in better understanding and analysis of the changes in urban land use patterns.

AB  - This study examines the impact of land use policy variations on urban growth in a transborder region. A primary analysis is conducted using multitemporal maps and satellite imagery for the adjacent cities of Gorizia, Italy, and Nova Gorica, Slovenia, twin towns historically trapped on a political border, a line that has changed in its degree of separation from extreme during the Cold War to minimal today. The SLEUTH land use change model is calibrated and used for forecasting land use change from 2005 to 2040. The model is run under three different scenarios, once for the whole area and twice independently for the two sides of the border, allowing a comparison of the resulting differences. The validation of the results shows that both the cities are growing independently and that territorial cohesion has no impact on change in land use pattern of the region. To plan for a sustainable future, it is invaluable to be able to successfully demonstrate policy impacts via computer modeling, simulation, and visualization and to use the forecasts within decision and planning support systems.

AB  - Abstract This paper models and assesses the risk of a class of uncontrollable fire, firestorms in the East Bay hills, San Francisco Bay, California. A Geographic Information System (GIS) is constructed which provides R frame-work For quantifying fine hazard in a heterogeneous landscape. Two models, one to assess the wildland fire hazard and the other to assess the urban/residential fire hazard, are integrated and embedded within the GIS to map regional and neighbourhood risk. The models generate a hazard assessment map comprised of polygons which represent the results of quantitative multivariate analysis. The system allows for future adjustment of one or all of the parameters as policy is implemented and hazardous conditions are mitigated. This features provides a mechanism for accounting and feedback allowing for the appraisal of the success of mitigation.

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - The paper deals with urban sprawl and land use planning to examine the role of scale and power for regional environmental governance processes. Urban sprawl is chosen as a field of study because it represents an environmental problem; and land use planning is regarded as the political intervention to solve the problem. Moreover, land use planning is a well suited policy field for environmental governance research because a variety of (state and non-state) actors is involved and various mechanisms of coordination (hierarchy, cooperation, competition) are effective. In order to analyse scale and power relations in detail, the example of a land use conflict in the metropolitan region of Munich, Germany is used. Â© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spatially explicit urban expansion models that can trace urban development in the past and predict the expansion scenarios in the future are indispensable for examining urban planning policies. This paper demonstrates a new urban expansion scenario (UES) model by coupling one "bottom-up" cellular automata (CA)-based model and one "top-down" system dynamics (SD)-based model. By implementing the UES model in Beijing, the urban evolution from 1991 to 2004 was simulated and the UESs from 2004 to 2020 were predicted. The results suggest that a dilemma of urban expansion versus limited water resource and environment deterioration exists. Dealing with such a dilemma remains a challenge for the local government. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AbstractLand use planning plays an important role in achieving sustainable urban development. One of the problems planners frequently encounter is the absence of an integrated quantitative approach to assessing land-use suitability and supporting land use planning (site level), particularly in urban renewal. This paper develops a geographic information system (GIS)-based framework to solve this problem. The framework consists of three main modules: land information database, planning/policy control mechanism, and model of land-use suitability analysis (LUSA). In the process of developing this framework, three tasks are completed. First, key factors affecting land-use decision making in urban renewal planning are identified and 20 of them are quantitatively examined from five perspectives of land attributes: inherent/physical, locational, social, economic, and environmental. Second, two submodels, namely, the criterion-value generation model and suitability assessment model are designed and built for LUSA ...

AB  - One of the sources of data most utilized in Europe by planners, policy makers and researchers is CORINE Land Cover (CLC) because of its wide territorial coverage. However, the users of this spatial database do not have information on its quality for analysing urban land and its evolution. This study analyses the limitations of CLC for monitoring urban land use dynamics, using Madrid Land Use as a mapping refer- ence. This is a local geographical database with higher resolution for theMadrid region that coincides with CLC at the years of reference (2000, 2006). The results show that with respect to the total urban land area in 2000 and 2006 and the area converted to urban land between 2000 and 2006, CLC is relatively reliable. However, the confusion matrices show very high error rates, especially in dynamic analyses (changes between 2000 and 2006) and when there is differentiation between different types of land use. Researchers, planners and decision-makers should therefore exercise considerable cau- tion when using this source for analysing urban land use and its dynamics for local approaches.

The CAD data is used for the shape modeling for the high-storied buildings and civil structures with complicated shape since the data for that is not included in the 3D-GIS data accurately. The unstructured mesh based on the tetrahedron element is employed in order to express the urban structures with complicated shape accurately. It is difficult to understand the quality of shape model and mesh by the conventional visualization technique. In this paper, the stereoscopic visualization using virtual reality (VR) technology is employed for the verification of the quality of shape model and mesh.

AB  - This paper proposes a method that facilitates urban water demand modeling estimations where the costumer information system (CIS) is lacking or inadequate, based on a geographic information system (GIS). This method determines a per capita water supply based on socioeconomic status, according to the urban marginalization classification defined for each geo-statical basic area (AGEB), provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in Mexico. For the year of study, 2005, a comparison between water demands estimation by the. Toluca, Mexico, city water agency and this method based on AGEBs information has been done. It can be concluded that problems like an inadequate water distribution could be solved through spatial representations of projected demand. Thus, the water supply strategy design includes an appropriate control tool for the planning and management of water resources. Furthermore, projection and supply water flow monitoring will allow the analysis of water needs by type of use and its reduction within a water-saving culture framework.

AB  - KEY WORDS: surface temperature, anisotropy, urban climate, sensor-view model Thermal remote sensing of urban areas is affected by directional variations (anisotropy) of the upwelling thermal radiation. The anisotropy arises due to the three-dimensionally rough urban surface that creates microscale patterns of surface temperature variability associated with surface position, orientation and composition, coupled with a biased view of this rough surface by the remote sensor. The large magnitudes of observed urban thermal anisotropy suggest it can be a significant factor in the interpretation of urban surface characteristics such as the surface urban heat island and application of urban surface temperatures to modelling urban surface heat fluxes. Here we couple the SUM urban surface sensor view model (Soux et al. 2004) with the urban canopy energy balance model of Mills (1997) and a newly developed three-dimensional energy balance model to investigate the variability of thermal anisotropy with surface geometric parameters. Relatively large anisotropy is modelled for realistic urban H/W ratios, and realistic plan area ratios generate a 30% variability of the thermal anisotropy over urban surfaces. Coupled simulations with both energy balance models yielded similar results for anisotropy in the case study examined. The simulations substantially under-estimated the anisotropy compared to observations from a helicopter-mounted thermal scanner despite showing good agreement between modelled and observed temperature differences between major urban surface facets. This suggests the simplified urban surface geometry used by the models is inadequate to replicate the observed anisotropy.

AB  - This paper formulates a new generation of Lowry-style models that combine a multizonal input-output model and an urban land use allocation model. Three different types of models are proposed: 1) an unconstrained model, 2) a primal of a linear programming approach that includes land supply constraints, and 3) a modified dual of the linear programming approach that allocates land based on additional conditions of economic efficiency. The modified dual formulation improves upon the limitations of Lowry models and their derivatives. First, the proposed model has sound theoretical underpinnings that incorporate the production theory of inputoutput models and the behavioral theory of optimization models. Second, the proposed model allocates land on the basis of economic efficiency by imposing a procedure that equalizes shadow prices. And third, the proposed model is an optimization model that fully accounts for the spatial and sectoral relationships of multiplier effects determining land use demand.

AB  - This report documents a Newton formulation of MODFLOW-2005, called MODFLOW-NWT. MODFLOW- NWT is a standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW- NWT must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF; Anderman and Hill, 2000) Packages. TheUPW Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. The GMRES Solver is documented in a previously published report, such that only a brief description and input instructions are provided in this report. However, the CGSTAB Solver (called ÏMD) is documented in this report. Flow-property input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. This report presents the theory and methods used by MODFLOW-NWT,including the UPW Package. Additionally, this report provides comparisons of the new methodology to analytical solutions of groundwater flow and to standard MODFLOW-2005 results by use of an unconfined aquifer MODFLOW example problem. The standard MODFLOW-2005 simulation uses the LPF Package with the wet/dry option active. A new example problem also is presented to demonstrate MODFLOW- NWTâs ability to provide a solution for a difficult unconfined groundwater-flow problem.

A simultaneous-equation model was used with an endogenous binary variable to reflect the parcelâs state of development and an endogenous continuous variable measuring parcel land value. Submarkets were identified using cluster analysis. The results suggest that the UGB slowed down development in urban submarkets but development accelerated in ruralâurban submarket interfaces where the UGB did not play a role in land values. r

AB  - This article proposes an innovative methodology to compute economic rents of land designed to current or potential offices uses. It consists in the establishment of a cause-and-effect relation between offices' price levels and correspondent levels of land rent, considering the main factors that influence property prices, the ones that guide public and private activities' location decisions and the inter-dependencies between land and real estate property markets. The rationale subjacent to this research is that land economic rent is determined by the difference between offices market price and a set of costs correspondent to land acquisition, planning and building processes, and a profit margin. An assessment of surplus values is provided in order to compute it as the difference between total land market value (land economic rent plus economic return on land use) and correspondent tributary patrimonial-value according to legal valuation proceedings (settled on property law). In order to reach these goals, variables that exert influence on urban planning and municipal management were identified, an urban management information system was designed and implemented, and an integrated and interactive model to support decisions in urban planning - concerning real estate offices and land prices and characteristics - was developed. These tools were applied as a case study to Oporto city (Portugal). They embody updating functionalities, setting up as an on-going support to policies of municipal land use management (particularly applied to offices uses). A proposal is made to integrate similar models in territorial plans as valuation tools to support better approaches to assess the impact of planning decisions on real estate and land values, thus informing a more equitable, efficient and local-based tax basis. Implications of this analysis for urban planning and fiscal settings are proposed. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Summary. There has been a fundamental institutional change during the transformation from the centrally controlled system to a market-oriented economy in China since the early 1980s. The socialist land use right as an institution of the out-going central planning system became an obstacle to the emerging land market for urban redevelopment, although land leasing as a new institution had created a real estate market primarily for the development of greenfield sites. From a case study of a district in Shanghai, it is discovered that rapid urban land redevelopment since 1992 has been greatly facilitated by the informal institution of a land development right. The land development right unlocks the process of land redevelopment in the central city, while the existing land usersâ land use right is taken care of during the gradual transition. Land use efficiency is improved to a great extent through land redevelopment to uses of higher productiv- ity. However, the informal and insecure institution of the land development right induces hasty land redevelopment. Assisted by a capricious land use planning regime, the land development right yields sub-optimal development. Clarification of property rights is the goal for further institutional change.

AB  - This paper describes an on-going work on the development and implementation of cellular automata based urban growth modeling using multitemporal satellite imagery. The algorithm is designed to simulate the historical growth as a function of local neighbourhood structure of the input data. Transition rules in the algorithm drive the urban growth over time. Calibration is introduced in the cellular automata model. Spatial and temporal calibration schemes are used to improve the prediction accuracy. Spatially, the model is calibrated on a township basis to take into account the effect of site specific features, while the temporal calibration is set up to adapt the model to the changes in the growth pattern over time. Calibration provides the optimal values for the transition rules to achieve accurate urban growth modeling. The paper discusses at the end a proposed automatic rule calibration method using genetic algorithm. The aim is to optimize the transition rule values. Prediction accuracy is selected as the fitness function. A set of strings are used as initial population over which the genetic algorithm runs till convergence. The cellular automata model is tested over city Indianapolis, IN, USA to model its urban growth over a period of 30 years. Besides the land use data derived from the satellite imagery, population density is used. Results indicate good accuracy on a township basis for short term (5 years) and long term (11 years) prediction. The model succeeds in adapting to the dynamic growth pattern. Genetic algorithm shows promising potential in the calibration process.

Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and detail-independent mechanism may be in action.We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggest that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follows a simple universal mechanism.

AB  - In urban systems modeling, there are many elaborate dynamic models based on intricate decision processes whose simulation must be based on customized software if their space-time properties are to be explored effectively. In this paper we present a class of urban models whose dynamics are based on theories of development associated with cellular automata (CA), whose data is fine-grained, and whose simulation requires software which can handle an enormous array of spatial and temporal model outputs. We first introduce the generic problem of modeling within GIS, noting relevant CA models before outlining a generalized model based on Xie's (1996, A general model for cellular urban dynamics. Geographical Analysis, 28, 350-373) "dynamic urban evolutionary modeling" (DUEM) approach. We present ways in which land uses are structured through their life cycles, and ways in which existing urban activities spawn locations for new activities. We define various decision rules that embed distance and direction, density thresholds, and transition or mutation probabilities into the model's dynamics, and we then outline the software designed to generate effective urban simulations consistent with GIS data inputs, outputs and related functionality. Finally, we present a range of hypothetical urban simulations that illustrate the diversity of model types that can be handled within the framework as a prelude to more realistic applications which will be reported in later papers.

AB  - With significant economic development in the last decade in China, urban land has increasingly expanded and encroached upon arable land in the last decade. Although many papers have analyzed the characteristics of urban land expansion, relatively less attention has been paid to examining the different expansion features of different-tier cities at a regional level. This paper analyzes the spatio-temporal differences of urban land expansion and arable land loss among different-tier cities of the BTH (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) region in China in the 1990s, and identifies social, economic, political and spatial factors that led to these differences. Based on urban land change data determined by interpreting Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, it was found that the urban land area in the BTH region expanded by 71% between 1990 and 2000. Different-tier cites, however, had enormous differences in urban development, such as speed of urban land expansion, speed of urban land per capita growth, and so on. These differences were closely related to rapid economic development, strict household registration systems, urban development guidelines (chengshi fazhan fangzhen), and national land use policies. Of all the new urban land, about 74% was converted from arable land, and there was a general tendency for smaller cities to have higher percentages. One of the important reasons for this result is that urban land is highly correlated with arable land in spatial distribution. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Constrained cellular automata (CA) are frequently used for modeling land use change and urban growth. In these models land use dynamics are generated by a set of cell state transition rules that incorporate a neighborhood effect. Generally, neighborhoods are relatively small and therefore only a limited amount of spatial information is included. In this study a variable grid CA is implemented to allow incorporation of more spatial information in a computationally efficient way. This approach aggregates land uses at greater distances, in accordance with a hierarchical concept of space. More remote areas are aggregated into consecutively larger areas. Therefore the variable grid CA is capable of simulating regional as well as local dynamics at the same time. The variable grid CA is used here to model urban growth in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) between 1996 and 2001. Calibration results are tested for goodness of fit at the cellular level by means of the kappa statistic and for land use patterns by means of cluster size analysis and radial analysis. Kappa results show that the model performs considerably better than a neutral allocation model. Cluster and radial analysis indicate that the model is capable of producing realistic urban growth patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Buildings have an effect on land use not only because of the extraction and processing of raw materials and disposal of wastes but also because buildings occupy land during their entire service life. In addition, location of buildings has an effect on the need of networks â such as traffic networks â and their land use. Land use related indicators are typically included in the European voluntary assessment systems of sustainable buildings. ISO 21929-1 defines two land use indicators for buildings: soil sealing and land use change. However, there is neither consensus nor a harmonised method to assess this issue. As an example, land use was not included in EN 15978:2011 due to lack of agreement on a calculation method. This study outlines the environmental aspects of buildingsâ land use, assesses the significance of land use that happens because of the land occupation of buildings compared to the land use because of the extraction of raw materials needed for the construction of buildings. The study has also includes information about the benchmarks of buildings in terms of land use related indicators, discusses, ands make conclusions about the compatibility of building level indicators with the urban level indicators.

AB  - This is an introductory course in urban transportation planning that examines the evolution of urban transportation systems in the United States, with particular emphasis on the complex relationships between transportation, land use, and urban form. The content of the course is divided into four parts. The first is a historical look at the planning and development of transportation systems and urban form in the U.S. The second part looks more conceptually and theoretically at the relationships between land use and transportation. The third part examines a number of land use and transportation policy questions facing planners today. And the fourth part explores the normative perspectives and values shaping our views of cities and their transportation systems.

AB  - Urbanization is one of the most evident global changes. Research in the field of urban growth modelling has generated models that explore for drivers and components of the urban growth dynamics. Cellular automata (CA) modeling is one of the recent advances, and a number of CA-based models of urban growth have produced satisfactory simulations of spatial urban expansion over time. Most application and test of CA-based models of urban growth which provide likely and reliable simulations has been developed in urban regions of developed nations; urban regions in the United States, in particular. This is because most of the models were developed in universities and research centers of developed nations, and these regions have the required data, which is extensive. Most of the population growth in the world, however, occurs in the developing world. While some European countries show signs of stabilization of their population, in less developed countries, such as India, population still grows exponentially. And this growth is normally uncoordinated, which results in serious environmental and social problems in urban areas. Therefore, the use of existing dynamic-spatial models of urban growth in regions of developing nations could be a means to assist planners and decision makers of these regions to understand and simulate the process of urban growth and test the results of different development strategies. The pattern of growth of urban regions of developing nations, however, seems to be different of the pattern of developed countries. The former use to be more dense and centralized, normally expanding outwards from consolidated urban areas; while the second is normally more fragmented and sparse. The present paper aims to investigate to how extent existing CA-based urban growth models tested in developed nations can also be applied to a developing country urban area. The urban growth model was applied to Porto Alegre City, Brazil. An expected contiguous expansion from existing urban areas has been obtained as following the historical trends of growth of the region. Moreover, the model was sensitive and able to portray different pattern of growth in the study area by changing the value of its parameters.

AB  - Land-cover and land-use (LCLU) change was quantified for the last 35 years within and in the vicinity of a fast growing city in Mexico, using rectified aerial photographs and geographic information systems (GIS). LCLU change was projected for the next 20 years using Markov chains and regression analyses. The study explored the relationships between urban growth and landscape change, and between urban growth and population growth. The analysis of Markov matrices suggests that the highest LCLU attractor is the city of Morelia, followed by plantations and croplands. Grasslands and shrublands are the least stable categories. The most powerful use of the Markov transition matrices seems to be at the descriptive rather than the predictive level. Linear regression between urban and population growth offered a more robust prediction of urban growth in Morelia. Hence, we suggest that linear regression should be used when projecting growth tendencies of cities in regions with similar characteristics.

AB  - This paper examines the role of land readjustment (LR) projects in suburban planning and land development in a case-study area in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. LR projects have been the most important planning tool in Japan, yet the results of their use to develop over 30 per cent of Japanese urban areas have been little examined. The paper challenges the conventional wisdom that LR projects are an effective means of preventing urban sprawl. Through interviews with local planners and participants in projects, and a detailed GIS mapping of land-use change and infrastructure development in the case-study area, the research presents an in-depth study of the use of LR for suburban land development, and a close look at the patterns of urbanisation on the fringe of Japan's most dynamic metropolitan region. It appears that while LR projects do clearly prevent sprawl within the project areas themselves, they tend to exacerbate problems of sprawl at the scale of the city and region.

AB  - The problem of traffic congestion is attracting lots of attention with the aim of investigating efficient solutions. To achieve models that comprehensively describe the system, useful data from the network is needed. A suggestion is to mount detectors in selected regions and study the system responses to various stimuli. This, however, might be costly and impractical in many cases. Traffic simulators are beneficial tools for providing a simulated environment of the network. The current study tries to develop a traffic simulator within NetLogo, an agent-based environment. Using this simulator, the effect of different light plans on average delay time (ADT) of vehicles is investigated. The results indicate that in a normal-sized network a better choice is the simultaneous change of lights. A long length is appropriate for low entering frequencies and an average length is more efficient for high entering frequencies. In geometrically bigger networks, lights are better to change every other one with an average length for low entering frequencies and a long length for high entering frequencies.

AB  - Urban land management requires the integration of a wide range of data on ecological process, environmental process and process on urban planning and development. This paper combined land suitability modeling with remote sensing (RS), landscape ecological analysis and geographic information system (GIS) to develop a spatial analyzing system for urban expansion land management. The spatial analyzing system incorporates the use of a multi-criteria mechanism in GIS for the suitability evaluation of urban expansion land. Grey relational analysis (GRA) was combined with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to address the uncertainties during the process of evaluation. This approach was applied to explicitly identify constraints and opportunities for future land conservation and development in Changsha City, China. Validation of the methodology showed a high degree of coincidence with the previous independent studies as regards ecological suitability. The methodology can be useful in environmental protection, land management and regional planning.

AB  - ssung The TRNSYS (TRaNsient SYstems Simulations) Hybrid Lighting Model was revised so that two colorimetric indices pertinent to indoor illumination, the correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI), could be predicted by the model. For calculation of the CCT and CRI relevant to the hybrid lighting system, the spectral power density (SPD) of beam normal radiation was needed. Though TRNSYS provides algorithms to calculate the magnitude of beam normal radiation on any surface, no methods were provided in TRNSYS to determine the SPD of solar radiation. This thesis describes the inclusion of a spectral model in TRNSYS: Gueymard's SMARTS2 (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) algorithm. This algorithm was used to calculate the SPD of beam normal radiation as a function of solar position, atmospheric turbidity, moisture content, and other atmospheric parameters. The TRNSYS hybrid lighting model, augmented by SMARTS2, was used to analyze building illumination and energy loads for a 2500 m2 office building equipped with a hybrid lighting system (HLS). The HLS uses two-axis tracking collectors to collect beam normal radiation that is later divided into visible and infrared components. The visible radiation is piped to luminaires inside the building using optical fibers, while the infrared radiation is focused on thermal photovoltaic arrays and used to generate electricity. The TRNSYS model calculated annual building energy loads (lighting, cooling, and heating) and energy savings in office buildings located in six U.S. cities: Honolulu, HI; Tucson, AZ; Reno, NV; Atlanta, GA; Seattle, WA; and Madison, WI; that were equipped with hybrid lighting systems. Using local utility rates and assuming 52 lm/W lamps efficacies (the commercial average in the U.S.), the annual energy savings per m2 collector area in these cities were: $240-Tucson, $140-Reno, $320-Honolulu, $40- Atlanta, $50-Madison, and $60-Seattle. For the colorimetry analysis, four representative lamp SPDs - warm white fluorescent, full spectrum fluorescent, tungsten incandescent, and halogen incandescent - were defined as standard indoor light source spectrums. Two cities were chosen to perform the analyses in: Tucson, which represented a clear climate with consistent beam normal radiation values, and Seattle, a cloudier climate. The CCT and CRI were calculated each hour during office working hours. When cloudy, the CCT and CRI of the illumination inside took on the values of the lamp providing it, but when beam normal radiation was available these values were influenced by the 5000-5500 K CCT and 80 CRI of the beam normal radiation transmitted though the HLS. Histograms showing the number of hours at varying CCT and CRI ranges for different locations and with different lamps are presented in Chapter 7.

AB  - Human population growth is increasingly transforming the landscape into urbanized land uses as more than 50% of humans worldwide now live in urban areas. The intensification of land use caused by urbanization threatens the long-term provisioning of ecosystem services. Urban remote sensing provides the opportunity to develop data to support ecological modeling specifically through the high resolution mapping of land cover over space and time. Integrated modeling of land cover, land use, and ecological systems is required to predict possible changes in future ecological conditions. I present an example of urban ecologicalmodeling where I combine the output from a land use change model with output from a land cover change model to predict avian species richness 25 years into the future.

AB  - Following their extensive use in other areas,1 computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have become more widely used in regional policy analysis (see Partridge and Rickman, 1998 for a survey of the regional CGE literature). Although regional CGE models have provided numerous unique policy insights, they have yet to replace other regional modelsâsuch as input-output and econometric modelsâas the standard tool for regional economic development analysis. To be sure, an input-output model is most often the only option for planners in very small regions (West, 1995). Aside from their complexity, the limited use of regional CGE models in practice likely stems from deficiencies in their current formulation, implementation, and description. Therefore, this chapter focuses on what needs to be done for CGE models to become more widely used in regional economic development policy analysis. A key aspect is discussion of features required for CGE models to become more useful in small-area economic policy analysis.

AB  - To address the pressing challenge of effectively managing multinational corporations' (MNCs) global sales forces, we offer a theoretical framework and investigate the effects, across cultures, of particular sales man- ager practices on sales manager effectiveness (SME). Further, we examine whether high SME is associated with salesperson commitment, regardless of national culture. The model is tested on survey responses from 888 salespeople from Canada, Mexico, the United States, China, Australia and New Zealand. The results reveal that national culture moderates most antecedents' relationships to SME. For example, masculinity weakens the positive effect of fixed compensation on SME, supporting the expectation that salespeople in highly masculine countries are more driven to achieve material rewards through greater variable pay. Collec- tively, study results suggest cultural conditions where managerial practices should be prioritized. SME has a universally positive effect on salesperson commitment, reinforcing the thesis that adapting sales manager practices across countries to optimize SME provides a tangible advantage.

AB  - The mechanism of urban growth and its interaction with social-economic and environmental systems are still poorly understood. Consequently, policy makers and planners often face tremendous difficulties in decision making with lack of vision into the future of urban growth. The Land-use Evolution and impact Assessment Model (LEAM) has been developed to as a comprehensive urban planning support system in a regional scale. LEAM incorporates ecological, geographic, and environmental theories into a single hierarchical framework, yet it is designed as an open architecture. LEAM is unique in that all sub systems are explicitly and separately modeled. Sub models are developed by experts, who have substantive knowledge relating to a particular system, using icon-based graphical modeling tool, STELLAÃ. These contextual sub-models are then linked to form the main framework of the dynamic model that run simultaneously on each grid cell of raster GIS map(s) in Spatial Modeling Environment (SME). The overall model then is created in an open and distributed manner. A land-use decision support system for St. Louis metropolitan region using LEAM approach has been developed.

AB  - Different processes shaping land?use patterns are observed at different scales. In land?use modelling, scale can influence the measurement and quantitative description of land?use patterns and can therefore significantly impact the behaviour of model parameters that describe land?use change processes. We present results of a rigorous sensitivity analysis of a cellular urban land?use?change model, SLEUTH, testing its performance in response to varying cell resolutions. Specifically, we examine the behaviour of each type of urban growth rule across different cell sizes, and explore the model's ability to capture growth rates and patterns across scales. Our findings suggest that SLEUTH's sensitivity to scale extend beyond issues of calibration. While the model was able to capture the rate of growth reliably across all cell sizes, differences in its ability to simulate growth patterns across scales were substantial. We also observed significant differences in the sensitivity of the growth rules across cell sizes, indicating that SLEUTH may perform better at certain cell sizes than at others. These findings emphasize the importance of scale considerations in land?use?change modelling research, particularly in terms of determining the relevant and appropriate scales of enquiry for the processes being simulated.

AB  - Cellular automata (CA) are an effective means of urban-growth simulation. Moreover, the development of a planning support system associated with the theory of artificial intelligence has recently become a new global challenge. In this paper we investigate a geosimulation model using CA based on the geographic information system (GIS) for visualising land-use patterns in urban partitions. Most recent simulation models using CA have been developed in regular grid nets or networks, where adjacent grids or networks in urban space are easily addressed. Our project explores how to utilise an irregular polygon dataset in a GIS database in order to deal with spatial microsimulation. A new concept used in this project takes into account the effects of urban planning, such as land-use zoning and street networks, at the level of parcels and blocks in urban space. Adjacent irregular parcels on both sides of a street are intended targets in the simulation. In this paper, a method of simulating land-use patterns in urban space after the implementation of land-readjustment projects is discussed.

AB  - In this paper we ask two questions: Does a multiscalar urban land-change model that couples a region-scale system dynamics model with a local-scale spatial logit model better predict the amount of urban land change than either model alone? Does a multiscalar urban land-change model that couples regional and local-scale factors better predict the spatial patterns of urban land change than a standalone local-scale spatial logit model? To examine these questions, we develop a coupled system dynamics spatial logit (CSDSL) model for the Pearl River Delta, China, that incorporates region-scale population and economic factors with local-scale biophysical and accessibility factors. In terms of predicting the amounts of urban land change, the CSDSL model is 15% and 18% more accurate than the standalone spatial logit and system dynamics models, respectively. In terms of predicting the spatial pattern of urban land change, the CSDSL model slightly outperforms the spatial logit model as measured by four spatial pattern metrics: number of urban patches, urban edge density, average urban patch size, and spatial irregularity of the urban area. Both the CSDSL and spatial logit models underpredict the number of discrete urban patches (by 64% and 80%, respectively) and the urban edge density (by 42% and 62%, respectively). While both models overpredict the average urban patch size, the spatial logit model overpredicts by over 316%, while the CSDSL overpredicts by 192%. Finally, the models perform equally well in predicting the spatial irregularity of urban areas and the location of urban change. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the CSDSL model outperforms a standalone spatial logit or system dynamics model in predicting the amount and spatial complexity of urban land change. The results also show that predicting urban land-change patterns remains more difficult than predicting total amounts of change.

There is a widespread belief amongst geographers, environmentalists, planners and some politicians that spatial planning of the metropolitan region has not been particularly successful in reducing urban pressures on rural areas. The aim of this study is to explore the apparent links between urban sprawl, spatial planning and changing land use in the rural-urban fringe of Barcelona. The paper demonstrates that the main impacts of sprawl have been concentrated in agricultural areas, and that the planning system has not been capable of containing urban growth.

AB  - Sustainable ecological and environmental development is the basis of regional development. The sensitivity classification of the ecological environment is the premise of its spatial distribution for land use planning. In this paper, a fuzzy matter-element model and factor-overlay method were employed to analyze the ecological sensitivity in Yicheng City. Four ecological indicators, including soil condition,, water condition,, atmospheric conditions and biodiversity were used to classify the ecological sensitivity. The results were categorized into five ranks: insensitive, slightly sensitive, moderately sensitive, highly sensitive and extremely sensitive zones. The spatial distribution map of environmental sensitivity for land use planning was obtained using GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. The results illustrated that the extremely sensitive and highly sensitive areas accounted for 14.40% and 30.12% of the total area, respectively, while the moderately sensitive and slightly sensitive areas are 25.99% and 29.49%, respectively. The results provide the theoretical foundation for land use planning by categorizing all kinds of land types in Yicheng City.

AB  - Modelling urban land use change can foster understanding of underlying processes and is increasingly realized using agent-based models (ABM) as they allow for explicitly coding land management decisions. However, urban land use change is the result of interactions of a variety of individuals as well as organisations. Thus, simulation models on urban land use need to include a diversity of agent types which in turn leads to complex interactions and coding processes. This paper presents the new ABMland tool which can help in this process: It is software for developing agent-based models for urban land use change within a spatially explicit and joint environment. ABMland allows for implementing agent-based models and parallel model development while simplifying the coding process. Six major agent types are already included as coupled models: residents, planners, infrastructure providers, businesses, developers and lobbyists. Their interactions are pre-defined and ensure valid communication during the simulation. The software is implemented in Java building upon Repast Simphony and other libraries.

AB  - China's economic reforms over the past decades have given rise to the development of a rudimentary urban land market. Although one cannot speak of a land "market" in the strict sense of the word, there is an urban land allocation system in which land lease rights can be acquired through the payment of a land-use fee. If the urban land market is to develop in a sustainable manner, new credible institutions need to be established that can safeguard greater legal security and transparency. For these purposes, it is necessary to establish a management system that can support the legal (tenure security), economic (leases, taxes) and broader aspects (spatial and environmental land use policies) of land administration. To make an urban land administration system socially credible and functional, land-related information should be registered and structured at a detailed spatial level, such as parcels. There is no parcel-based information system in China, but the country has developed a population registration system at a detailed spatial level that could be a starting point to develop integrated information systems, or a so-called "local spatial data infrastructure". This paper reviews China's population registration system and their spatial units and presents a proposal for an information system that can be expanded or adapted to meet the requirements of an effective land administration system. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a preliminary test of a graph-based, structural pattern recognition system - known as XRAG (eXtended Relational Attribute Graph) - that might be used to infer broad categories iof urban land-use from very fine spatial resolution, remotely-sensed images. XRAG allows the structural properties of, and relations between, discrete land-cover parcels to be analyzed and interpreted. Although the eventual aim is to derive land-use maps directly from remotely-sensed images, this paper employs Ordnance Survey 1:1 250 scale digital map data to provide the initial land-cover information. These data - free from the complex effects of mixed pixels, misclassification, shadowing and occlusion separability of several different categories of urban land-use based on the morphological properties of, and the spatial relations between, their component land-cover parcels. In future studies, the system will be tested on real images. The current system also needs to be extended to incorporate graph-searching algorithms and graph-similarity measures, so that it can be used not only to describe the structural differences between sample areas of known land use, but also to infer land use from the spatial pattern of land cover.

AB  - CITIES grow in a way that might be expected to resemble the growth of two-dimensional aggregates of particles, and this has led to recent attempts(1-3) to model urban growth using ideas from the statistical physics of clusters, In particular, the model of diffusion-limited aggregation(4,5) (DLA) has been invoked to rationalize the apparently fractal nature of urban morphologies(1). The DLA model predicts that there should exist only one large fractal cluster, which is almost perfectly screened from incoming 'development units' (representing, for example, people, capital or resources), so that almost all of the cluster growth takes place at the tips of the cluster's branches. Here we show that an alternative model, in which development units are correlated rather than being added to the cluster at random, is better able to reproduce the observed morphology of cities and the area distribution of sub-clusters ('towns') in an urban system, and can also describe urban growth dynamics, Our physical model, which corresponds to the correlated percolation model(6-8) in the presence of a density gradient(9), is motivated by the fact that in urban areas development attracts further development. The model offers the possibility of predicting the global properties (such as scaling behaviour) of urban morphologies.

This paper proposed a modeling and clustering method for network-level urban traffic status based on the dynamic traffic flow assignment ratios. The traffic assignment ratio matrix model integrates traffic status, topology and relation between links, with the dynamic traffic assignment ratios estimated by Linear Programming. The network-level traffic status is clustered by Self-Organizing Map and the typical patterns are discovered. The experiment proves the efficiency and applicability of this method for network-level traffic status modeling and analyzing.

AB  - Shape analysis of city growth is an essential means to develop a comprehensive city plan and the key elements of shape analysis are shape descriptors. Recently, many cellular urban models have been developed including the special models for lowland cities. Shape descriptors are the indices used for output of such urban models. Shape descriptors play a very important role in model fitness, calibration, validation as well as interpretation of the model outcome. This paper proposes the usage of image features that are commonly used in the field of image processing and computer vision as urban shapedescriptors. The cellular urban descriptors can be classified into geometric and multi-scale features. The geometric urban descriptors related with the shape of the city or development cluster of the city can be computed based on connected component or boundary of the cluster. Multi-scale urban descriptors take into account the role of development index of each cell. Determination of each cellular urban descriptor is described using urban development terminology. Special urban model for lowland cities is clarified and relationships of urban descriptor are investigated.

AB  - Qualitative calculus of policy models is an appropriate method for policy impact analysis in the case of imprecise information concerning the structural model parameters. The conditions of the so-called sign-solvability analysis of a linear equation system--with information represented by a positive, negative, or zero impact--are strict, however. In this paper, the relevance of qualitative calculus for urban policy modelling is discussed. An extension of the sign-solvability approach (with purely qualitative information) will be dealt with in the case of a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. We introduce the use of matrix decomposition methods, of theoretically plausible parameter restrictions, and of a top-down/bottom-up approach for sign-solvability. The sign-solvability approach is applied to a dynamic policy simulation model of urban decline in The Netherlands, developed for the city of The Hague. Given the insufficiently reliable database for estimating the model in a conventional econometric way, qualitative calculus was used in order to infer conclusions regarding the direction of impacts of policy variables.

AB  - This longitudinal case study of residential development pressure in a village in Glasgow's urban fringe provides detailed insight into the different perspectives of key public, private and community interest groups, and exemplifies the conflict resolution process in this environment in the context of the new post-2006 planning system in Scotland. The paper is organised into six main parts. In part 1 the major actors in the residential development process are identified with specific attention focused on the house-builder and the local planner. In part 2 the post-2006 development planning and development management process in Scotland is explained in order to establish the legislative and procedural context for the case study. Part 3 provides a review of urban growth n the Glasgow metropolitan region. Part 4 sets the case study in local context by providing representative examples of development pressure and conflict resolution in the District. Part 5 comprises detailed examination of conflict over pressure for residential development in the village of Torrance from 1971 to the present day. This in depth analysis illuminates the main actors, agents and arguments involved in the conflict resolution process; explains the rationale for decisions reached on residential development in the village; and affords insight into contemporary debate over house-building in the metropolitan fringe around Scotland's cities. Finally, some conclusions are presented on the issues of fairness and sustainability in the land use planning system and the on-going conflict between private profit and public interest in the production of the built environment around the edge of Britain's cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed approach seamlessly integrates multi-objective programming, fuzzy set theory, and system dynamics tools to conduct optimal land use planning in dynamic and complex environmental systems. Based on the DMOP approach, this study constructs an interactive dynamic multi-objective programming model, investigates the connection between land use and future urban development, and incorporates the preferences of decision makers using a compromise index. A case study from Taiwan shows that the proposed modeling framework can accommodate more complete information, allowing improvements to be made in strategic planning for land use.

AB  - AbstractUrban land-use planning is becoming increasingly complex in China because it requires estimating the future urban extent and balancing its various aspects, e.g.,Â provision of enough housing and employment opportunities and preservation of the environment. This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system. In addition to these nonspatial goals, objectives concerning the spatial distrib...

AB  - Classic paradigm of scientific modeling is mainly based on a set of previously, accepted or assumed theories about the target phenomena and a validation procedure by limited observations. Therefore, normally data has a supporting role in the modeling process. On the other hand, recent advances in computing technology have brought us a data deluge that may change the classic paradigm of scientific modeling. Information flows and data streams have reached a level of maturity that they can play the main role in modeling of the real systems, without relying on lots of assumptions and rules in the first step. This turn may cause an inversion in the concept of modeling as a rational process. The proposed theoretical idea in this work is that traditional theory-driven models have a theoretical limit in modeling complex systems, known as curse of dimensionality and further, to highlight the fact that massive urban data streams can open up a new data-driven modeling approach, which goes beyond simple data driven analytics or eye catching info-graphics toward operational models of complex phenomena. In this work we describe a conceptual framework for modeling city wide traffic dynamics that proposes a way to encapsulate the complexity based on abstraction power of Markov chains in a coexistence with continuous data streams. Therefore, finally as an experimental set up, we applied the proposed model to a real data set, consisting of GPS traces of taxi cabs in Beijing and the results have been explained.

AB  - Selecting an appropriate process modeling language forms an important task for organizations engaging in Business Process Management initiatives. A plethora of process modeling languages has been developed over the last decades, leading to a need for rigorous theory to assist in the evaluation and comparison of the capabilities of these languages. While substantial academic progress in the area of process modeling language evaluation has been made in at least two areas, using an ontology-based theory of representation or the framework of workflow patterns, it remains unclear how these frameworks relate to each other. We use a generic framework for language evaluation to establish similarities and differences between these acknowledged reference frameworks and discuss how and to what extent they corroborate each other. Our line of investigation follows the case of the popular BPMN modeling language, whose evaluation from the perspectives of representation theory and workflow patterns is comparatively assessed in this paper. We also show which tenets of modeling quality these Communications of the Association for Information Systems 2 frameworks address and that further research is needed, especially in the area of evaluating the pragmatic quality of modeling.

AB  - China is experiencing rapid progress in industrialization, with its own rationale toward industrial land development based on a deliberate change from an extensive to intensive form of urban land use. One result has been concerted attempts by local government to attract foreign investment by a low industrial land price strategy, which has resulted in a disproportionally large amount of industrial land within the total urban land use structure at the expense of the urban sprawl of many cities. This paper first examines "Comparable Benchmark Price as Residential land use" (CBPR) as the theoretical basis of the low industrial land price phenomenon. Empirical findings are presented from a case study based on data from Jinyun County, China. These data are analyzed to reveal the rationale of industrial land price from 2000 to 2010 concerning the CBPR model. We then explore the causes of low industrial land prices in the form of a "Centipede Game Model", involving two neighborhood regions as "major players" to make a set of moves (or strategies). When one of the players unilaterally reduces the land price to attract investment with the aim to maximize profits arising from the revenues generated from foreign investment and land premiums, a two-player price war begins in the form of a dynamic game, the effect of which is to produce a downward spiral of prices. In this context, the paradox of maximizing profits for each of the two players are not accomplished due to the inter-regional competition of attracted investment leading to a lose-lose situation for both sides' in competing for land premium revenues. A short-term solution to the problem is offered involving the establishment of inter-regional cooperative partnerships. For the longer term, however, a comprehensive reform of the local financial system, more adroit regional planning and an improved means of evaluating government performance is needed to ensure the government's role in securing pubic goods is not abandoned in favor of one solely concerned with revenue generation.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe the process through which climate change scenarios were downscaled in an urban land use model and the results of this experimentation. The land use models (Urban Growth Model [UGM] and the Land Cover Deltatron Model [LCDM]) utilized in the project are part of the SLEUTH program which uses a probabilistic cellular automata protocol. The land use change scenario experiments were developed for the 31-county New York Metropolitan Region (NYMR) of the US Mid-Atlantic Region. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), regional greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions scenarios (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 and B2 scenarios) were used to define the narrative scenario conditions of future land use change. The specific research objectives of the land use modeling work involving the SLEUTH program were threefold: (1) Define the projected conversion probabilities and the amount of rural-to-urban land use change for the NYMR as derived by the UGM and LCDM for the years 2020 and 2050, as defined by the pattern of growth for the years 1960-1990; (2) Down-scale the IPCC SRES A2 and B2 scenarios as a narrative that could be translated into alternative growth projections; and, (3) Create two alternative future growth scenarios: A2 scenario which will be associated with more rapid land conversion than found in initial projections, and a B2 scenario which will be associated with a slower level of land conversion. The results of the modeling experiments successfully illustrate the spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for the years 2020 and 2050. The application of these results into the broader scale climate and health impact study is discussed, as is the general role of land use/land cover change models in climate change studies and associated environmental management strategies.

Our computational pipeline computes a per-building 2.5D volumetric reconstruction by exploiting photo-consistency where it is highly sampled amongst the aerial images. Our building surface graph cut method overcomes errors of occlusion, geometry, and calibration in order to stitch together aerial images and yield a visually coherent texture-mapped result. Our comparisons show similar quality to the manually modeled buildings of Google Earth, and show improvements over naive texture mapping and over space-carving methods.

Shanghai city in China is selected as a case to fulfill the tasks. The major findings are summarized as follows: (1) the integrated model is proved to be competent in monitoring and projecting the dynamics of urban growth. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the urban area of Shanghai is predicted to increase at an annual rate of 3%. and amount 1474 km(2) in 2020. Spatially, the newly increased urban land is most likely to expand around the vicinity of city center or sub-centers, and mainly along a west-east axis and a north-south axis.

AB  - China began to introduce market principles and establish price mechanism to better manage land and improve land use efficiency in the late 1980s. Since then, land m.arkets begin to emerge. A benchmark land price system,providing guidelines for land use rights selling and transferring, was established in order to overcome lack of market data and experiences in land transaction. The benchmark prices of land use rights are determined by land use, land use density (floor-land ratio), land grades, land improvement, and tenant resettlement costs. This paper first conducts a formal analysis based on modern urban economic theory. The formal model provides a theoretical foundation in which the bench mark land price system is assessed and evaluated in terms of land use and urban development. The paper then concludes thatthe benchmark price system has two theoretical problens. One is associated with the fact that floor-land ratio plays an important role in land price determination whereas the theory suggests the other way around. That is, floor-land ratio depends on land prices. The other problem is that the benchmark land price system does not provide adequate room for the substitution between land and capital inputs. The substitution is a key in achieving land use efficiency in land markets and urban development process. It is concluded that the practice of the benchmark land price system is at odd with reforms that aim to introduce market principles and mechanism to guide resource uses. Therefore, it is recommended that further land policy reform should be taken.

AB  - Recent approaches to modeling urban growth use the notion that urban development can be conceived as a self-organizing system in which natural constraints and institutional controls (land-use policies) temper the way in which local decision-making processes produce macroscopic patterns of urban form. In this paper a cellular automata (CA) model that simulates local decision-making processes associated with fine-scale urban form is developed and used to explore the notion of urban systems as self-organizing phenomenon. The CA model is integrated with a stochastic constraint model that incorporates broad-scale factors that modify or constrain urban growth. Local neighborhood access rules are applied within a broader neighborhood in which friction-of-distance limitations and constraints associated with socio-economic and bio-physical variables are stochastically realized. The model provides a means for simulating the different land-use scenarios that may result from alternative land-use policies. Application results are presented for possible growth scenarios in a rapidly urbanizing region in south east Queensland, Australia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a lack of information on the environmental effects of urban change and the dynamics of greenspace. Such information is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. We therefore investigated the changes in land use and land cover of 11 residential areas in Merseyside, UK, using aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 2000.We then modeled how these changes would alter three important environmental parameters: surface temperature, runoff of rainfall, and greenspace diversity. These changes were then related to the socio-economic status of the areas, as measured by an index of multiple deprivation. The comparisons revealed a loss of greenspace in all 11 case study sites Overall, the more affluent, low density areas lost more greenspace, especially of tree cover. A major cause was infill development whereby gardens were built over. However, greenspace was also lost in already densely built-up, deprived areas due to the reuse of derelict land. As a consequence, the models used in this study predicted negative environmental impacts for all areas. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts such as urban densification and give more weight to the preservation and management of urban greenspaces.

Traditional image-based modeling methods often cannot model such large areas due to error accumulation and limited camera field of view. Our approach widens the camera field of view by constructing a 360 degree panorama from ground-level images and uses a high resolution orthorectified aerial image to provide the building footprints. Users draw the building outlines in the aerial image and select a point as the approximate ground camera location. The method automatically extracts roof corners in the ground images and registers the panorama to the aerial image according to geometric constraints. The height of each building is calculated from an estimated camera pose. The resulting textured model of the buildings is constructed of planar surfaces.

AB  - An increasing number of models for predicting land use change in rapidly urbanizing regions are being proposed and built using ideas from cellular automata (CA). Calibrating such models to real situations is highly problematic and to date, serious attention has not been focused on the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a structure for simulating urban change based on estimating land use transitions using elementary probabilistic methods which draw their inspiration from Bayes' theory and the related 'weights of evidence' approach. These land use change probabilities drive a CA model based on eight cell Moore neighborhoods implemented through empirical land use allocation algorithms. The model framework has been applied to a medium-sized town, Bauru, in the west of SÃ£o Paulo State, Brazil. We show how various socio-economic and infrastructural factors can be combined using the weights of evidence approach which enables us to predict the probability of changes between land use types in different cells of the system. Different predictions for the town during the period 1979-1988 were generated, and statistical validation was then conducted using a multiple resolution fitting procedure. These modeling experiments support the essential logic of adopting Bayesian empirical methods which synthesize various information about spatial infrastructure as the driver of urban land use change. This indicates the relevance of the approach for generating forecasts of growth for Brazilian cities in particular and for world-wide cities in general. Â© 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A sustainability technology evaluation platform has been prototyped for simulating integrated technology systems within a specific urban regional context. âSustainability technologiesâ refer to available and potentially available technologies that may help to decrease human pressures on the environment or natural resources while providing a desired standard of living. The platform is based on an Internet-based infrastructure for integrating distributed models, called DOME (distributed object-based modeling environment) that has been developed to provide a simulation environment in which large systems, such as an urban region, can be modeled. The infrastructure can support flexible and transparent integration of independently developed computational tools from a wide range of fields such as geographic information systems, inputâoutput analysis, life cycle analysis, and technology process modeling. The tools are linked in a decentralized ad-hoc manner so that an integrated simulation can be developed as understanding of the system grows. Tools are available to observe and understand the emerging structure of the system simulation, and to evaluate and optimize the system based upon its behavior.The urban sustainability technology evaluation platform is built from three basic types of computational elements linked through DOME. These are elements that provide information defining the urban region, elements that simulate behavior of technologies to be evaluated, and elements that integrate and analyze the region-specific effects of the technologies. As an example of the first type, a GIS (geographic information system)-based land use object has been developed to provide information needed to drive simulation models for a wide variety of urban technologies. Examples of the second type include technology simulation models of photovoltaic solar cell modules (PV modules). An object that provides a generalized life-cycle assessment by calculating both the direct and indirect effects of a given technology on total production levels and total pollution emissions in a region using Leontief InputâOutput analysis represents the third type of computational element. All of the objects support Internet-enabled GUI''s (graphic user interfaces) through the DOME infrastructure, allowing users to transparently connect to, interact with, and utilize object functionality or data.A system model is constructed from these elements to study the economic cost and effect on emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> associated with installing PV modules on the rooftops of buildings in Tokyo, Japan. The development of this technology evaluation simulation illustrates the use of the three types of objects and how, by using the DOME infrastructure, they may be linked to form system models to evaluate sustainability technologies.

AB  - This article provides a historical overview of land use policies and urban development in Brazil, especially during the period when the country experienced high rates of urbanization. Since most land use policy is enacted at the national level, a synopsis of Federal legislation regulating property rights and land tenure is presented, including a recent law known as the City Statute, which institutes new parameters and tools to advance the regularization of informal settlements in urban areas. A description of how urban planning tools have been used by several local governments, in isolation and in combination with land use policies, to regularize informal settlements follows an exploration of new land tenure paradigms that focus on legitimacy rather than legality. The paper concludes with an analysis of prospects for land ownership and security of tenure for the urban poor in Brazil. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Concerning urban and regional development, it seems that the effect of agglomeration economies has been extensively studied, but very little attention has been paid to the contribution from the economies of network. This paper attempts to show that regional development is not only brought about by the economies of urban agglomeration, but also that it results from the transportation network. It presents a theoretical model for analysing the relationship between the economies of network and urban agglomeration, and regional development. Meanwhile, it also provides some empirical evidence from the Japanese regional economies.

AB  - This paper presents a fine-scale (30 meter resolution) regional land cover modeling system, based on the SLEUTH cellular automata model, that was developed for a 257000 km2 area comprising the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin in the eastern United States. As part of this effort, we developed a new version of the SLEUTH model (SLEUTH-3r), which introduces new functionality and fit metrics that substantially increase the performance and applicability of the model. In addition, we developed methods that expand the capability of SLEUTH to incorporate economic, cultural and policy information, opening up new avenues for the integration of SLEUTH with other land-change models. SLEUTH-3r is also more computationally efficient (by a factor of 5) and uses less memory (reduced 65%) than the original software. With the new version of SLEUTH, we were able to achieve high accuracies at both the aggregate level of 15 sub-regional modeling units and at finer scales. We present forecasts to 2030 of urban development under a current trends scenario across the entire Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, and three alternative scenarios for a sub-region within the Chesapeake Bay watershed to illustrate the new ability of SLEUTH-3r to generate forecasts across a broad range of conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Shenyang and Fushun are two most nearest mega cities in China. Integration of the two cities as one sub-administrative economic region is a state and province policy to promote economy development of Liaoning province. How the urban patterns of the mega cities will grow is interested to city planners, decision-makers, land managers, ecologists, geographers, and resource managers because it's special policy and spatiotemporal dynamic complexity. This study explore the combined application of remote sensing, geographical information system and SLEUTH urban growth model to analyze and model urban growth pattern in Shenyang-Fushun metropolitan area northeastern China. The sequential RS images can give quantitative descriptors of the geometry of urban form to be computed and compared over time. The investigation is based on a 16-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical TM satellite imagery. The SLEUTH model was calibrated using the mutil-temporal data set for the 6391.12km2 area where has experienced rapid urbanization in recent years. The model allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth, and future growth was projected out to 2050 assuming four different policy scenarios: (1) current trends (CT), (2) accelerated urban development (AUD), (3) protected urban development (PUD), and (4) limitative urban growth (LUD). The predicted urban growth shows similar compact pattern under each scenario except the current trends scenario that shows diffused urban growth pattern and most diffused growth appears at south of region. Edge growth and road gravity growth are the main growth types in the future. The accelerated urban development scenario shows the most urban growth area. The limitative urban growth scenario shows the least urban growth area. The protected urban development scenario shows moderate urban growth area and good protection to other land resources. The urban land of two mega cities will connect firstly to a whole on the south bank of Hun River about in 2040 in the accelerated urban development and the current trends scenarios, and will not connect on the other two scenarios until 2050. The combined method using remote sensing, geographical information system and SLEUTH urban growth model is powerful for representation, modeling and prediction of the spatiotemporal urban growth, and useful for understanding the alternative future planning scenarios, but location accuracy and scenarios design must be further considered for local application.

AB  - This study developed a process model which includes three steps for urban growth simulation. A preprocessing step is required to classify three satellite images acquired in 1990, 2000, and 2009 into six land use types using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS). The first step of the process model is to project the population using cohort component method for 2014. The second step is to quantify the corresponding amount of urban land demands based on a regression model between population and urban land use. The third step is to optimize the weighting values for six criteria using the weighted scenario method (WSM), cellular automata (CA) model, and GIS in order to make a grid-based optimal potential map. Two accuracy assessment methods were adopted to evaluate the accuracy of urban growth simulation, pixel by pixel comparison, and zonal statistics method, the latter of which was used to calculate the number of grid cells per zone of time distance. The comparison results show a good agreement between observed and simulated urban land use maps. Finally, the urban land use map for 2014 was simulated. This process model can be used to evaluate the spatial expansion phenomena and simulate urban growth.

AB  - This study examines urban agriculture in a relatively large Third World city -- Nairobi. This article focuses on urban farmers, their spatial distribution and characteristics, cultivation practices, crop types, consumption patterns and crop produce disposal. It is concluded that urban agriculture contributes to food self-sufficiency and helps raise the nutritional standards of poor urban residents who are otherwise unemployed or holding down low-paying (juakali) occupations, particularly female-headed households. Therefore, there is a need to formulate a comprehensive land use plan which incorporates food production and socioeconomic structures for urban centres in Kenya.

AB  - Standard urban economic theory suggests that stringent urban land-use regulation leads to higher housing prices due to both direct impacts on costs and a reduction in the price elasticity of supply. Indonesia has one of the most restrictive land registration and construction permitting systems in Asia, yet housing is affordable, rates of household formation are high, and housing supply is relatively elastic. This paper explores the relationship between land use regulations and housing markets in Indonesia through various analyses; an overview of 90 cities, a direct assessment of the relationship in 15 cities, and detailed case studies of two medium-sized cities. Regulations do impact the production of housing in Indonesia, but they do not affect housing markets in the predicted way because of their flexible enforcement and a widespread and dynamic informal housing-production system. The main impact of the strict land-use regulations in Indonesia is thus argued to be under investment in physical infrastructure related to housing; a substantial detriment to urban development and economic growth. The case of Indonesia demonstrates the importance of regulatory enforcement and local context in the analysis of land use regulations. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - China has undergone large-scale urban expansion and rapid loss of cultivated land for more than two decades. The goal of this paper is to examine the relative importance of socioeconomic and policy factors across different administrative levels on urban expansion and associated cultivated land conversion. We conduct the analysis for urban hotspot counties across the entire country. We use multi-level modeling techniques to examine how socioeconomic and policy factors at different administrative levels affect cultivated land conversion across three time periods, 1989-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005. Our results show that at the county level, both urban land rent and urban wages contribute to total cultivated land conversion. Contrary to expectations, agricultural investment drives farmland conversion, suggesting a policy failure with unintended consequences. At the provincial level, urban wages and foreign direct investment both positively contribute to cultivated land conversion. We also find that higher GDP correlates with more urban expansion but the relationship is nonlinear. Â© 2012.

AB  - How to use land is the key to urban planning and one of the most important elements of any urban development programme. In China, owing to a large population and a small available land area, proper land use is essential. Land use planning in urban China faces two major challenges: to answer a high demand for modern living conditions, and to keep land use per capita at a relatively low level.

AB  - Pressures on urban policy-makers in Africa to formalize land tenure and land delivery systems are mounting, while at the same time there is increased demand for informal access to urban land for subsistence production and low-cost housing. In Kampala, Uganda, semi-subsistence agriculture is an important component of the urban economy, yet it is a technically illegal form of land use and largely misunderstood by urban authorities and policy-makers. This paper analyzes the means of access to land, much of it informal, and discusses possible policy responses to competing demands over urban and peri-urban land.

AB  - Oregon's landmark land use planning system has been criticized for imposing large negative effects on landowners' property values, although evidence to support these claims has been lacking. This paper examines longitudinal data for undeveloped parcels since before adoption of the planning system. The sample includes parcels under different land use regulations, and it compares Oregon to Washington. The results indicate generally that property values have increased at similar rates both inside and outside urban growth boundaries, and across parcels zoned for different uses and across state lines. The results are consistent both with theory and with other studies indicating land use regulations can have positive, neutral or negative effects. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper first examines urban spatial patterns of the gradients of housing and land prices and land development intensity, and then tests the relationship between the land price gradient and housing price gradient. Urban theory predicts the former is steeper than the latter based on the notion of derived demand for land from the provision of housing services. Finally the paper examines the impact of the property of housing production function on urban spatial structure. For the property of housing production function, we are particularly interested in the elasticity of capital-land substitution. The paper concludes (1) market influences over spatial structure, (2) the derived demand for land, and (3) it is the actual (or expected) housing price increases that cause skyrocketing land prices, not the other way around. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - SLEUTH is a modified cellular automata (CA) model which consists of an urban growth sub model and a land cover change transition sub model. The urban growth model is the main component of SLEUTH, which is tightly coupled with the land cover change transition model. This model was chosen to calibrate urban growth in two Asian cities, Chiang Mai (Thailand) and Taipei (Taiwan). These cities are undergoing rapid land use/land cover change as a result of robust economic and population growth. SLEUTH cellular automata model contains characteristics that offer advantages for modelling physical dynamics. Because of its cellular data structure, it can be integrated with raster-based remote sensing data. Calibration of the SLEUTH model requires gridded inputs of topographic slope, land use, zones excluded from growth, urban spatial extents, transportation networks and terrain hillshading. These data were developed from remote sensing and from topographic maps using GIS, and were prepared at three different resolutions. This research applied the SLEUTH cellular automata model to explore land use dynamics of the two Asian cities over several decades. Three phases of calibration were used, corresponding to progressively higher spatial resolutions whilst the ranges of SLEUTH parameters were narrowed. The result yielded five key parameters characterizing historical urban growth patterns and suggesting a basis for exploring future scenarios of land-use change. We discuss the lessons learned from applying SLEUTH model to Chiang Mai and Taipei compared to other SLEUTH applications. The study reveals that: (1) urban development in Chiang Mai is best captured by Xmean and edge growth regression scores, whereas Taipei is best simulated by fitting using the Lee Sallee shape correspondence index; (2) the SLEUTH model can be applied to study urban land use dynamics in both countries, when some adaptations for spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are made. With a suitably calibrated model, the next phase of research is to use it to explore alternative futures by adjusting some of the key parameters. It is also intended to use the urban extents from other years in the calibration to observe the model sensitivity to temporal data sets. At this stage the model moves from a descriptive tool to one that could help facilitate deliberation about alternative futures about the urban growth patterns for Chiang Mai and Taipei. The historical understanding provided  by the model would need to be communicated in graphics, but with care many of the cellular automata ideas are intuitive and visually exciting for researchers to explore (Lebel, et. al., 2005). In conclusion, applying the SLEUTH model to Taiwan and Thailand can increase the potential use of remote sensing and GIS data for the land cover change modeling. The result will be very useful to city planners, resource managers, policy makers and others in the related fields.

AB  - The challenge of facilitating economic density is fundamental for successful urbanization. Flexible and forward-looking institutions that help the efficient functioning of land markets are vital in this respect. In particular, institutional arrangements for regulating land use, managing public land and allocating land rights have significant implications for how cities deliver agglomeration economies and improve the welfare of their residents.


This book provides fresh insights into these issues, compiling selected pieces of analytical and empirical research presented at the World Bank's Fourth Urban Research Symposium on Urban Land Use and Land Markets, held in Washington, DC, May 2007. Specially commissioned papers helped develop a robust analytical foundation to clarify ongoing debates on urban land management and welfare and synthesized the political and administrative challenges of improving the efficiency of urban land markets. Among the questions that this book addresses are:


- Does more public intervention in land markets produce more affordable land market outcomes?

- Do conventional approaches to strengthening property rights bolster security of tenure and market transactions?

- How should governments go about integrating informal settlements with the broader city economy?

AB  - Urban growth analysis and simulation have been recently conducted by cellular automata (CA) models based on self-organizing theory which differs from system dynamics models. This paper describes the Beijing urban development model (BUDEM) which adopts the CA approach to support urban planning and policy evaluation. BUDEM, as a spatio-temporal dynamic model for simulating urban growth in the Bei- jing metropolitan area, is based on the urban growth theory and integrates logistic regression and MonoLoop to obtain the weights for the transition rule with multi-criteria evaluation configuration. Local sen- sitivity analysis for all the parameters of BUDEM is also carried out to assess the modelâs performances. The model is used to identify urban growth mechanisms in the various historical phases since 1986, to re- trieve urban growth policies needed to implement the desired (planned) urban form in 2020, and to simulate urban growth scenarios until 2049 based on the urban form and parameter set in 2020. The model has been proved to be capable of analyzing historical urban growth mechanisms and predicting future urban growth for metropolitan areas in China.

AB  - A 3D reconstruction of an urban area for Virtual Worlds (VWs) or Serious Games (SGs) requires a careful trade-off among the 3D models' realism, weight and development time. This has led us to the definition of an algorithm â the Architectonic Style Area (ASA) algorithm â for procedural generation of buildings in an urban area, based on the concept of âarchitectonic likelihoodâ, that intends to give players the sense of being in a particular city or even specific area of a city. This has a cognitive foundation in the fact that, after a visit, a tourist typically does not remember every single palace of a city, but remembers â beside the most important monuments and buildings â its general features and its architectonic styles. The algorithm extrudes 2D maps and composes faÃ§ades by statistically assembling sample images of architectonic components from the target city. Components are classified in an ontology based on the classic principles of architecture. The algorithm relies on rules that encode the semantics of the ontology. The paper describes the algorithm and the related easy-to-use visual authoring tool. It also shows the results in two different projects: a SG for the promotion of the cultural heritage and a 3D movie. Results show that the approach allows keeping the realism of every single building at good detail and of the overall scene, while dropping a huge work of image collection and processing for the textures. Comparisons are investigated with regard to state of the art urban modeling methods, highlighting the differences and possible synergies.
