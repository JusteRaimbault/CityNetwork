AB  - Agent-based urban traffic simulation has been looked as an efficient tool for traffic planning. However, the main problem is how to build an agent-based model for traffic simulation. This research presents an urban traffic information intelligent control model, which adopts a multi-agents coordination approach for urban traffic information control to coordinate the traffic network. In this paper, we propose a new traffic information intelligent control hybrid model based on multi-agent system that performs the basic interface, planning and supports services for managing different types of demand responsive transportation. In this research, we expose the main features and the behaviors exhibited of the multi-agent system. Based on this model, a simplified multi-agent traffic information control system can be developed that is effective for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.

AB  - This paper addresses an issue of short-term traffic flow prediction in urban traffic networks with traffic signals in intersections. An effective spatial prediction approach is proposed based on a macroscopic urban traffic network model. In contrast with other time series based or spatio-temporal correlation methods, this research focuses on the substantial mechanism of vehicles transmission on road segments and the spatial model of the entire urban network. Furthermore, this approach employs a simple speed-density model based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to obtain a more accurate vehicle travel time on the link. Finally, the microscopic traffic simulation software, CORSIM, is adopted to simulate the real urban traffic, and the proposed method is used to predict the traffic flows generated by CORSIM. The simulation results illustrate that our approach performs effective prediction timely in the rush hours, as well as the suddenly changed traffic states. 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Full article: Bangkok, Thailand, 16th May 2012—Thai police have seized the carcasses of two Tigers, a Leopard and a Golden Cat from a house in Khan Na Yao, in Bangkok today.  Officers from the Crime Suppression Division and the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police have arrested a Thai man and a Vietnamese man in connection with the crime. All three species are protected in Thailand, and are all listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The animals, found chopped up and stuffed into a freezer in the house, were believed to have been sourced from Malaysia and moved through Sadao, a district in the southern Thai province of Songkla, which shares a border with Malaysia.  Initial investigations have shown the animals were bound for China via Nong Khai, a town near the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.   From Nong Khai, the animals were to be transported across the Mekong River to Lao PDR before being moved to China.  Police said the suspects were paid 8,000 Baht (USD250) to transport the animals from the south of Thailand to Bangkok.  The seized animals have been handed over to the Wildlife First Aid Clinic where samples will be taken for DNA analysis.  “Any DNA analysis should be undertaken with an eye toward establishing the origins of these animals. Going forward, it will be important to know exactly where they came from.” noted TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director, Dr. William Schaedla.  “We also hope the Thai authorities will undertake a thorough investigation of the transport routes being utilized by the smugglers and co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighboring countries. Simply seizing dead animals will not be enough to prevent future losses of tigers and other endangered animals to wildlife trafficking.”  For further images of the haul, please contact Richard Thomas, +44 752 6646216, richard.thomas@traffic.org.

AB  - In order to represent the fuzzy attribute of traffic state, this paper first analyzed the characteristics and spread mechanism of traffic congestion on urban road network. Then a traffic state coefficient was introduced to measure the congestion level on road sections. On the basis of cloud theory, a fuzzy method of traffic state identification was proposed. By constructing judgment matrix, an analytic hierarchy model was established for road network. Finally, the model was applied in the case of traffic state identification for road network around Wuchang Railway Station. Researches indicated that the identification result conformed to actual situation.

AB  - This paper puts forward an alternative method which deals with the simulation and estimation of urban traffic network. The method is based on Cell Transmission Model (CTM), a macroscopic model for freeway traffic modeling. Some modifications on basic CTM are made to meet the requirement of urban traffic modeling. In order to test the performance of this model, a small virtual traffic network is set up and its simulation results are compared with those of Paramics', a microscopic simulator implemented under similar conditions. Furthermore, a much larger virtual network based on real metropolitan traffic system is constructed and investigated, using which we test the propagation of congestion. We reach the conclusion that our macroscopic model has the potential to depict the general evolution of urban traffic system, and simulate the propagation of congestion within complicated traffic network.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Control in urban traffic networks constitutes an important and challenging research topic nowadays. In the literature, a lot of work can be found devoted to improving the performance of the traffic flow in such systems, by means of controlling the red-to-green switching times of traffic signals. Different techniques have been proposed and commercially implemented, ranging from heuristic methods to model-based optimization. However, given the complexity of the dynamics and the scale of urban traffic networks, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. In this work, a new hybrid model for the traffic behavior at an intersection is introduced. It captures important aspects of the flow dynamics in urban networks. It is shown how this model can be used in order to obtain control strategies that improve the flow of traffic at intersections, leading to the future possibility of controlling several connected intersections in a distributed way.

AB  - The concepts of transport mode energy consumption and road network capacity are explained in the paper, which are applied to forecast the minimum energy consumption in a Meg polis. A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - It has been approved that the scale-free feature exists in various complex networks, such as the internet, the cell or the biological networks. In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field “science of complexity” has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Today’s self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic “patterns”. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially “enslaves” its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the “higher” level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the “lower” levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

AB  - ‘Urban growth’ refers to the process of growth and decline of economic agglomerations. The pattern of concentration of economic activity and its evolution have been found to be an important determinant, and in some cases the result, of urbanization, the structure of cities, the organization of economic activity, and national economic growth. The size distribution of cities is the result of the patterns of urbanization, which result in city growth and city creation. The evolution of the size distribution of cities is in turn closely linked to national economic growth.

AB  - Full article: A project to promote sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plants in the mountains of China’s Upper Yangtze ecoregion has won the prestigious Equator Prize 2012.   The Equator Prize recognizes outstanding local initiatives working to advance sustainable development solutions for people, nature and resilient communities in countries receiving support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).   It is the second time the success of the project has been publicly acknowledged; in October 2011, the project received an “Outstanding Contribution Award” from the Chinese State Ministry of Environmental Protection, EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), Ministry of Commerce and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Over-harvesting of wild medicinal plant species is a serious conservation concern—aside from problems caused by the harvesting itself, the collectors can also have serious secondary impacts through camping within reserves, hunting and gathering fuel-wood to dry commercial quantities of medicinal plants. Such habitat destruction and disturbance also threatens endangered wildlife, including the Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the Takin Budorcas taxicolor.   The collection of medicinal plants in the Upper Yangtze is rising, with households compensating for loss of income from farming and timber logging due to the promulgation of two policies: a 1998 logging ban and a “Grain for Green” programme, introduced in 2000, which discourages farming on steep slopes.  To help alleviate matters, an initiative was developed through a comprehensive collaboration between WWF, IUCN and TRAFFIC as part of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), which led to local producer association members, harvesters and governmental officials receiving training in the implementation of organic wild crop harvesting practices and certification procedures, as well as application of the FairWild Standard principles.   “We are delighted to see public recognition of the success of this initiative, which has demonstrated how sustainable harvesting of wild plant resources creates positive benefits for local livelihoods and conservation efforts,” said Anastasiya Timoshyna, TRAFFIC’s Medicinal Plant Programme Leader.  Income for local producers in the project areas has increased, thanks to higher prices paid for certified sustainably harvested medicinal and aromatic plants. In the case of Schisandra berries Schisandra sphenanthera, international and local buyers paid at least 30% above normal market prices for certified produce. A survey of project sites in March 2011 found incomes from medicinal plant collection had risen, thanks to the certification schemes; in one village by almost 18% over 2007 levels.   The project also led to the establishment of links between producer associations and buyer groups: two communities have signed purchase agreements with a local winery and the newly established Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Cooperative has signed a 5-year fair trade agreement with a Californian company for supply of sustainably harvested Schisandra fruits.   In 2010, more than 5 tonnes (dry weight) of Schisandra fruits were sustainably harvested of which more than 3 tonnes were sold to Draco Natural Products (DNP Shanghai) for production of a concentrated dry extract specified by US-based Traditional Medicinals Inc (TMI). The project has scaled up from one village in the 2008 and 2009 harvests up to 22 villages in the 2011 harvest. From the autumn 2011 harvest, about 11.5 tonnes were shipped to DNP, enough to produce about 1.2 tonnes of certified organic dried extract for use in TMI products.   Further development of the project, supported through the Kangmei Institute of Community Development and Marketing has seen further adoption of sustainable harvesting methods in the region, and communities working through international partnerships to promote a ‘giant panda friendly’ brand and to create panda friendly certification standards for local harvesters.   “This project is proving that local harvesters from villages surrounding the Giant Panda conservation area can successfully implement meaningful sustainability standards,” said Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability for TMI.  “The Schisandra harvesters are helping to protect the panda bear habitat from disturbance while working to conserve biodiversity and earning additional household income through an organic and fair price premium.  “Traditional Medicinals remains committed to a long-term equitable trade relationship with the 22 participating villages represented by the Shuijing TCM Cooperative.   “Schisandra is only the first success story. As other wild medicinal plant species are added to the cooperative’s sustainable wild harvesting management plan, with eventual certified organic and panda friendly designations, household income will increase as a result of empowering and rewarding local communities for the important work of nature conservation.”

AB  - The structure and layout of an urban transportation network have decisive effects on urban logistics operation efficiency. The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

A dynamic variational inequality assignment model in saturated urban traffic network is proposed based on a boundary equilibrium concept. This concept is used to deal the saturated signalized intersections as bottlenecks based on saturated flow and green split to simplify the calculation of queuing delay. In this model, the flow propagation constraint, FIFO constraint, link capacity constraint and the physical queue are considered. Finally, a solution algorithm is proposed and the efficiency of the model and algorithm is demonstrated through an example calculation.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

Assuming that the system can access statistical information of the aggregated traffic demands between source-destination pairs or zones in the transportation network, traffic congestion can be reduced by using the total travel time of the system as a measure in a traffic assignment model. This paper focuses on a traffic or route assignment problem that incorporates stochastic traffic demand, which can be solved with a Genetic Algorithm.

It is shown that the effects of tariffs, urban wage subsidies and urban production subsidies in the short run, in which capital is immobile, do not carry over to the long run with capital mobility.  Policies for promoting urban growth reduce the urban unemployment ratio in the short run, but, by contrast, raise the urban unemployment ratio in the long run.  Along with agglomeration economies and inter-sectoral externality, the urban unemployment ratio plays a key role in determining social welfare.  Three traditional policy options of a small open economy are discussed.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to solve shortest path problems in route choice processes when each link's travel time is a fuzzy number, called the Perceived Travel Time (PTT). The PTT is a subjective travel time perceived by a driver. The algorithm solves the fuzzy shortest path problem (FSPA) for drivers in the presence of uncertainty regarding route travel time. For congested networks, the method is able to find the shortest path in terms of perceived travel time and degree of saturation (congestion) along routes at the same time. The FSPA can be used to support the fuzzification of traffic assignment algorithms. The applicability of the resulting FSPA for the traffic assignment was tested in conjunction with incremental traffic loading and was applied to a large-scale real network. The results of the traffic assignment based on the FSPA, User Equilibrium (UE) and a stochastic loading network model (Dial's assignment algorithm) were compared to the observed volume for certain links in the network. We conclude that the proposed method offers better accuracy than the UE or Dial's assignment algorithm for the network under testing.

AB  - Accelerated population growth in general and an increasing expanse and intensity of metropolitan development through- out the world have focused attention on urban transportation and growth management. The high cost of urban highways and mass transit systems, coupled with the necessity of guiding private use of land toward acceptable levels of rational development, have resulted in various urban investment strategies. Among these, the concept of joint development of transportation facilities and high activity nodes has emerged as a promising solution to problems of overcrowding and congestion in major cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Such integrated public and private investment not only tends to maximize the cost effectiveness of required facilities, but offers opportunities benefit of the public at large and as an incentive for risk capital investment. A comprehensive study was undertaken by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning of Texas A&M University to examine the requisites of effective joint development in selected metropolitan areas, including Toronto and Montreal, Canada; Washington, DC, San Francisco and Atlanta in the USA; and Paris, France. In all instances, it was found that fixed guideway rapid transit had a discernible, positive impact on urban growth and intra-urban transportation, opportunities provided versely, it was confirmed that effective application of this strategy required the pre-existence of economic viability in general, and in the specific transportation for imaginative growth management and was, indeed, a major inducement for private investment.

Crossroads are important part of urban traffic system, whose flow prediction on each direction is one of the most extraordinary key functions in the urban ITS. Some forecasting models have been developed, but these methods' precision usually can't meet with practical requirement. In this article, a neural network model is presented for forecasting crossroads traffic flow using backpropagation (BP) neural network. Through forecasting traffic flow at Hongqi crossroad in Ganzhou City, the result shows that this model has a considerable accuracy, which provides a new reliable and effective way of forecasting short term traffic flow of crossroads in urban road network.

In this paper, for the sake of improving the network efficiency, we present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for urban traffic network based on hybrid systems, which formulates split control as an MPC problem. Theoretical results ensure convergence of iterations to a globally optimal solution. The framework is applied to the signaling split control of traffic network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a comparative study on the ZhongGuanCun west region, Beijing was conducted using traffic simulation software. Findings indicate that the proposed control strategy is more efficient to reduce delay time and relieve traffic congestion of the whole traffic network when compared to the conventional fixed time control.

Importantly, we are frequently required to understand how traffic condition changes if we, for instance, construct a new route and/or alter traffic regulations. Especially, for a congested urban expressway network, we must estimate time-dependent changes of traffic to evaluate impacts of new policies and development of infrastructures. In developing the SOUND model, special attentions are paid so that it incorporates drivers’ route choice behavior and controls traffic density as a function of the flow to simulate the shockwave propagation.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

The two-fluid (the vehicles in traffic flow are divided into moving vehicles and stopped vehicles) model is able to describe the average operating performance of urban traffic, but it is difficult to collect individual vehicles data in the network for practical application of the model in urban area. The sampling strategies on data collection based on probe vehicles are stated in the paper and trip histories of probe vehicles are aggregated across link-based microtrip in order to estimate the model parameters. The algorithm of cost function is applied to map-matching with the help of GIS (Geographic Information System). The critical speed for identifying the vehicle state is determined through sensitivity analysis. The field experiments showed that the application of probe vehicle data is reliable to assess the network performance and traffic condition of urban street network.

Interesting structures (e.g. windmill-like ones, T-shirt-like ones, Y-like ones) have been revealed. A metastability of the system is observed in the transition from the saturation state to the global deadlock state. The effect of an advanced traveller information system (ATIS), the traffic light period and the traffic light switch strategy have also been investigated.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many existing traffic signal control systems are of a hierarchical structure employing the concept of subsystems or subzone signal control. Therefore, network partitioning becomes an important task of such an urban traffic signal control system. However, urban traffic signal control network partitioning is a multiobjective and multiconstraint problem, which has been shown to be a NP-hard problem. This paper presents a partitioning method using the spectral methodology according to the correlation degree of each link. Two measures are adopted in this problem: modularity and average cut weight. The developed method has been tested on two networks, including a computer generated network and real world road network. The results show that the spectral bisection is a reasonable network partitioning method to support urban traffic signal control.

On the basis of the component analysis of urban transport system, `mode-route' map is put forward to describe the whole travel process and three-dimensional space-time operating diagram is also constructed to reflect the competitive nature on space-time of all traffic modes. Then the trip assignment model for urban traffic system based on network equilibrium, with making generalized travel costs including latent cost as road impedance function, is set up and solved using an improved F-W algorithm. At last, a numerical example is used to illustrate the scientificity and validity of the proposed model.

Despite a voluminous empirical research of traffic mode structure, most of them have failed to adequately consider the ecology problem. On the basis of satisfying all requirements of eco-transportation system, and according to the common problems such as traffic jam, serious traffic pollution, low efficiency of utilizing resources, this paper first proposes the idea of traffic mode structure optimization, it combines optimization with traffic planning; secondly, it analyzes the main objectives and constrains; finally, it establishes an fuzzy programming model of traffic mode optimization as a result of the uncertainty of transportation system in the future.

AB  - Currently most optimization methods for urban transport networks (i) are suited for networks with simplified dynamics that are far from real-sized networks or (ii) apply decentralized control, which is not appropriate for heterogeneously loaded networks or (iii) investigate good-quality solutions through micro-simulation models and scenario analysis, which make the problem intractable in real time. In principle, traffic management decisions for different sub-systems of a transport network (urban, freeway) are controlled by operational rules that are network specific and independent from one traffic authority to another. In this paper, the macroscopic traffic modeling and control of a large-scale mixed transportation network consisting of a freeway and an urban network is tackled. The urban network is partitioned into two regions, each one with a well-defined Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), i.e. a unimodal and low-scatter relationship between region density and outflow. The freeway is regarded as one alternative commuting route which has one on-ramp and one off-ramp within each urban region. The urban and freeway flow dynamics are formulated with the tool of MFD and asymmetric cell transmission model, respectively. Perimeter controllers on the border of the urban regions operating to manipulate the perimeter interflow between the two regions, and controllers at the on-ramps for ramp metering are considered to control the flow distribution in the mixed network. The optimal traffic control problem is solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach in order to minimize total delay in the entire network. Several control policies with different levels of urban-freeway control coordination are introduced and tested to scrutinize the characteristics of the proposed controllers. Numerical results demonstrate how different levels of coordination improve the performance once compared with independent control for freeway and urban network. The approach presented in this paper can be extended to implement efficient real-world control strategies for large-scale mixed traffic networks. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - It is well-known that big cities suffer from traffic congestion and all consequences that come with it. This is an especial problemin cities in developing countrieswhere the public transportation systemis not reliable andwhere the fleet of vehicles tend to be old thus increasing air pollution. There is no turnkey solu- tion for this problem, but several improvements have been suggested in the field of urban and traffic management, provided an information system is built which can provide information to both the traffic experts and the user of the system. Such an information system has to incorporate features of an ITS and an ATIS. An un- derline assumption is that there is a simulation model to provide certain kinds of information in forecast. This paper discusses the model and implementation of such an information systemwhich is based on a microscopic model of simulation and on cellular automata and is implemented using agent technologies and with a bottom-up philosophy in mind. We give here an overview of the project, the details of the modules (data, simulation, driver and information/visualization), as well as discuss an application of the simulation tool.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Over the theory the realization of the control method is also presented. To validate the effectiveness of the controller a busy traffic network was chosen for test field. The MPC strategy was implemented into the test network control system (hardware in loop simulation). The applied environment is a microscopic traffic simulator with mathematical software and proper computational applications for the evaluation. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the designed MPC based traffic control strategy. The system is able to improve the network efficiency and reduce travel time, creating optimal flow in the network subjected to control input constraints.

AB  -  This paper deals with an Agent-based Model of a Decision-Support System for an Urban Transport Network. The present Multi-Agent Decision-Support System (MADSS) assists the regulator in the search of the appropriate regulation decisions in case of a bus traffic disturbance. It is composed of a Supervision Module and a Regulation Module that rely on the information given by the Automatic Vehicle Monitoring system (AVM). The supervision Module represents the temporal axis of the network by the agents of type BUS and the spatial axis by the agents STOP. These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach. Hence, through the cooperative aspects of the agent interactions, the MADSS is able to perform a coherent and preventive regulation process.

AB  - Time-lapse aerial photography over the Central Business Districts (CBD) of Austin and Dallas, Texas, has been employed to determine the averages of concentration, speed and fraction of vehicles stopped and to examine the relations among such network-wide averages including the flow which was measured on the ground simultaneously. The results have indicated that the average flow in a street network may indeed be expressed as the product of the space mean speed and concentration. Simultaneous ground experiments have also been conducted in the Austin CBD to investigate the reasonableness of the assumptions of the "two-fluid model," a curvilinear relation between the trip time and stop time per unit distance, which may be used in characterizing the quality of traffic service in urban street networks. As a result of these simultaneous ground experiments and aerial observations, the assumptions of the model have been verified. Moreover, relations between the fraction of vehicles stopped and concentration as well as between speed and concentration have allowed the two-fluid model to be used to compare the quality of traffic service in various street networks under the same level of concentration. The two-fluid model may then be used to predict, for a given change in vehicular concentration in a street network, the resulting changes in the averages of speed, fraction of vehicles stopped, flow, etc. This is particularly useful as a performance model in urban planning where for a given concentration it is desirable to predict the resulting traffic conditions.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - The consequences and outward signs of urban growth are increasingly being called into question. In particular, urban growth involves new travel practices which change old urban references. The urban space as experienced by the inhabitants does not necessarily follow the administrative borders of towns. This involves an increase in the use of the private car, the mode most adapted to this new urban reality. And this raises the question of the influence on road safety. Links between urban growth, new travel practices and road safety have been little dealt with in the literature. The article looks therefore into the question of the consequences of urban growth on travel practices and their influence on road safety problems. To deal with this question, a "life territory" was defined to account for new travel practices. This method gives a better picture of new urban realities. The study was carried out in the area of Salon-de- Provence (France). An analysis of urban evolution in the area was then placed alongside the evolution of road safety. And the results show that the question of the influence of urban growth on road safety can be posed in terms of a reflection on the effects of road network management and road improvement. Urban growth causes road safety problems due to the increase in traffic and use of the networks, but these can be managed to a certain degree. And reflections should include the effects of regulations within the urban system. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities, both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes, road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes, and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads due to different travel purposes, problems from using current non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes: comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km. The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research estables a three-tier NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift), NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms, benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network at the urban central area of Beijing is built up. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - Discovering traffic bottlenecks and taking action to alleviate congestion to enhance the performance of a traffic network are the most important tasks for the advanced traffic management system in the intelligent transportation system. However, traffic bottlenecks are affected by several factors and vary with spatial and temporal environments, which makes them difficult to define and discover. This paper proposes a three-phase spatiotemporal traffic bottleneck mining (STBM) model, including several spatiotemporal traffic patterns and STBM algorithms that use the raw data of location-based services to discover urban network spatiotemporal traffic bottlenecks. This paper implements an STBM prototype system based on a taxi dispatching system in a Taipei, Taiwan, urban network. The experimental results show that the congestion prediction capability of the proposed heuristic methods (congestion-propagation heuristic) is up to 79.6% during workdays and 72.1% on weekends, which outperforms other methods (e.g., the congestion-converge heuristic, the congestion-drop heuristic, and congested object item), and the discovered spatiotemporal bottlenecks match the travelers' experience.

Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - This paper presents a novel fuzzy model and a fuzzy logic controller for an isolated signalized intersection. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal waiting time and length of queue. Usually fuzzy traffic controllers are optimized to maximize traffic flows/minimize traffic waiting time under typical traffic conditions. Consequentially, these are not the optimal traffic controllers under exceptional traffic cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We apply state-space equations to formulate the average waiting time vehicles in traffic network at fixed time control. also, We propose a novel fuzzy model and new fuzzy traffic controller that can optimally control traffic flows under both normal and exceptional traffic conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller at novel fuzzy model is better that of conventional fuzzy traffic controllers under normal and abnormal traffic conditions.

AB  - The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

AB  - Full article: New York, USA, 25th September 2012—Poaching and the illicit trafficking of wildlife products were raised on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time this Monday, during discussions on strengthening national and international governance. World leaders gathering in New York for the global body’s 67th annual meeting highlighted wildlife trafficking along with other severe threats to the rule of law such as corruption and drug running.  In a written statement, permanent Security Council member United States highlighted “the harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts, rule of law, governance and economic development.” The rapidly-growing illicit international trade in endangered species products, such as rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger parts, is now estimated to be worth $5 billion per year globally.   “Such organized crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing,” Gabon’s President Ali Bongo said during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. “Gabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon. But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperation.”   Permanent member France also emphasized the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime. “There are still entire sectors of activity without any legal safety,” French Minister Delegate for Development Pascal Canfin said. “International law is lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural resources, for example, or the trafficking of fauna.”   President Bongo took the occasion to reaffirm his country’s commitment to “combating violations of the Convention on International Trade [in] Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora as well as other conventions to protect the environment and biodiversity.”  In response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa, President Bongo oversaw the burning of Gabon’s seized ivory stockpile earlier this year after a full audit supported by WWF and TRAFFIC. Organized criminal syndicates, sometimes linked to armed insurgent groups, are believed to be behind many of the tens of thousands of elephant poaching deaths occurring in Africa each year. Ivory tusks are highly valuable on Asian black markets.   “Illicit wildlife trafficking can have severe consequences for people as well as the environment, yet it is not considered a serious crime by many governments. It is often a low risk and high profit criminal activity, which is a dangerous combination,” said Wendy Elliott, WWF Global Species Programme Manager. “Governments have made a significant step forward by introducing the issue into this important forum on the rule of law. We now call on all them to increase their law enforcement responses to wildlife crime on a commensurate basis.” Roland Melisch, Director of TRAFFIC’s Africa & Europe programmes said: “Good governance is essential to prevent crimes such as illicit wildlife trafficking. Countries need to be held accountable to their commitments under relevant United Nations treaties.”  WWF and its partner TRAFFIC, the wildlife monitoring network, are campaigning for greater protection of threatened species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants. In order to save endangered animals, source, transit and demand countries must all improve law enforcement, customs controls and judicial systems. WWF and TRAFFIC are also urging governments in consumer countries to undertake demand reduction efforts to curb the use of endangered species products.

AB  - It is very important to select hub nodes or key junctions before urban traffic signal control system (SCOOT or SCATS) divides control sub-areas. Usually, traffic flow and link numbers are used as indexes to find out which hub nodes are in urban traffic network. However, these indexes could not reflect the traffic network topology characteristics like free scale features which are very helpful to protect the effectiveness of regional traffic signal control system under `intentional attack' of traffic incidents. In this paper, new method of node importance analysis, hub node selection and application of urban traffic complex network is discussed. Firstly, urban traffic network is abstracted as weighted complex traffic network using junction as node and travel expense (travel time) as link weight. Secondly, using network cohesion as index, weighted node contraction method is applied to evaluate the importance of node and effective results are shown applying it on simulation network. Finally, based on hub node selection, SCATS system optimization strategies are also illustrated.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the recent changes in the Soviet Union, China and North Korea will bring about big changes in transportation network in Eurasia. The difficulties of the existing transportation network in this area axe examined. Directions for developing transportation networks between Korea, China, Mongolia and Russia are suggested with a focus to the unified Korea. Access to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia by rail would be possible by connecting the missing links, and its competitiveness could be increased. The establishment of direct air routes can also reduce air passenger-km and fuel consumption quite a lot.

AB  - The problem of traffic congestion is attracting lots of attention with the aim of investigating efficient solutions. To achieve models that comprehensively describe the system, useful data from the network is needed. A suggestion is to mount detectors in selected regions and study the system responses to various stimuli. This, however, might be costly and impractical in many cases. Traffic simulators are beneficial tools for providing a simulated environment of the network. The current study tries to develop a traffic simulator within NetLogo, an agent-based environment. Using this simulator, the effect of different light plans on average delay time (ADT) of vehicles is investigated. The results indicate that in a normal-sized network a better choice is the simultaneous change of lights. A long length is appropriate for low entering frequencies and an average length is more efficient for high entering frequencies. In geometrically bigger networks, lights are better to change every other one with an average length for low entering frequencies and a long length for high entering frequencies.

AB  - This paper shows the similarity between transportation networks and thermodynamic systems. In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

A simple example and a more complicated urban-design case study are included to demonstrate the viability of this approach in solving the simultaneous-optimization problem. As a secondary benefit, this set-partitioning model can be reformulated as an integer, generalized-network, flow problem for which new efficient computer codes, capable of solving networks with thousands of nodes and variables, are available.

AB  - Full article: UK, 18th March 2013 - As part of the response to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) the UK government has announced it will not commit to long-term financial support for the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) beyond 2013-14. This team plays a vital role in preventing wildlife crime here in the UK, and is also a contributor in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.  Commenting, Heather Sohl, species expert for WWF-UK said: "This is highly disappointing news, especially after the UK has fought hard towards an end to international wildlife trafficking at the CITES meeting over the last two weeks.[1] When the world is recognising illegal wildlife trade as a serious crime and looking for government commitments to end the trade, the UK should be stepping up its efforts to address these crimes within our own borders. The recommendations of the Committee are reasonable and would have achieved this, but the government is avoiding a long-term commitment to tackling wildlife crime."  The Government also rejected recommendations to tighten up the recording of wildlife crime data to help keep track and tackle trends in wildlife crime. Stephanie Pendry, Enforcement Programme Leader at TRAFFIC, who has worked as part of the unit, said: "I have witnessed first-hand the vital role that this unit plays. In the case of illegal wildlife trade, culprits are often part of wider criminal networks that operate across borders, and cracking down on such trade takes time and joint effort. It is precisely this time that the Unit have not been afforded by the Government, which is a real shame and will have a knock-on effect on operations to protect wildlife."  WWF and TRAFFIC gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) early last year and this was reflected in the October 2012 report on wildlife crime in the UK. It suggested that enforcement of wildlife crime in the UK is suffering due to the short term availability of funds, a lack of proper training and guidance over prosecutions, and unnecessarily complex legislation.[2]  UK prosecutors and judiciary must be aware of the serious nature of these crimes and how to handle them appropriately. Available penalties are not applied rigorously enough to reflect the nature of illegal wildlife trade crimes, so fail to act as a strong deterrent for future offences. Specialist wildlife crime training for generalist prosecutors and sentencing guidelines for the judiciary are needed.  The creation of specific wildlife crime codes have been rejected by the Home Office, but without the ability to record wildlife crime levels it is impossible to show the impact of such crime, and what trends are occurring, both over time and regionally. It is hard to justify more resources when it is not possible to demonstrate the true size and trends of the problem. If codes are not the answer, WWF and TRAFFIC urge the government to demonstrate an appropriate, alternative way to capture the information on crimes so desperately needed using existing systems.  Many of the EAC recommendations are also reflected in their inquiry from 2004. WWF and TRAFFIC strongly urge the Government to reconsider how it can take appropriate actions to address wildlife crime.

AB  - A traffic condition identification method based on regional road network was put forward in order to accurately identify real-time traffic condition and distribution of road network. On the analysis of the traffic status parameters of the intersection and section, the road network model was built. With the average travel time as the traffic parameters of regional network, traffic condition analysis models were built. The connected matrix and reach ability matrix were used to identify the traffic states of network. The case analysis results show that the connected matrix and reach ability matrix could reflect the connectivity of intersections and the reach ability of different paths under different traffic crowded degree threshold, and could find out the key intersections and key sections in the network. It could be used to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of traffic state of the whole network. The simulation result shows that the method of traffic state judgment of road network is feasible, which can be used in traffic control, traffic information release and traffic induction.

AB  - Current network measurement systems are becoming highly sophisticated, producing huge amounts of convoluted measurement data and statistics. As a very common case, those networks implementing statistics reporting based on the NetFlow [15] technology can generate several GBs of data on a daily basis. In addition, these measurements are often very hard to interpret. In this chapter we describe a method that provides linguistic summaries of network traffic measurements as well as a procedure for finding hidden facts in the form of linguistic association rules. Thus, here we address an association rules mining problem. The method is suitable for summarization and analysis of network measurements at the flow level. As a first step, fuzzy linguistic summaries are applied to analyze and extract concise and human consistent summaries from NetFlow collections. Then, a procedure for mining hidden facts in network flow measurements in the form of fuzzy association rules is developed. The method is applied to a wide set of heterogeneous flow measurements, and is shown to be of practical application to network operation and traffic engineering [6, 5], where it can help solve a number of current issues.

In particular, we focus on the field of car accidents control, by considering the problem of the optimal location of intersection safety cameras (ISC) on an urban traffic network to maximize road control and reduce the number and the impact of car accidents. The effectiveness of accidents prevention programs can be increased by changing periodically the position of the available ISCs on a given time horizon. To this aim, we propose a novel multiperiod maximal covering location approach designed to maximize the overall coverage on the whole discretized time horizon. The results of the application of this methodology on a real dataset concerning road accidents occurred on a portion of the urban traffic network of the city of Rome are presented and discussed.

AB  - Traffic congestion has become a stringent issue in urban areas. Traffic control systems are designed to make a better use of the existing traffic infrastructures in order to improve traffic conditions. Along with the fast development of the transportation infrastructures, traffic networks become larger and more complex. Therefore, network-wide traffic control systems that can coordinate the whole network and improve the utilization of the entire traffic infrastructure, are highly required. In this paper, a structured network-wide traffic controller is presented based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) theory. Two macroscopic models are proposed to be the prediction model of the MPC controller. One is more accurate, but correspondingly requires more computation time; the other sacrifices a certain amount of accuracy, but is computationally much more efficient. Based on these two models, MPC controllers are developed. Simulation results show that the MPC controllers are capable of coordinating an urban traffic network, especially in the situations that the traffic flow is not spread evenly through the network. Through reducing the prediction model, the corresponding MPC controller exhibits less on-line computational burden, and thus becomes more applicable in practice. Therefore, it becomes possible for the control system to deal with complex urban road networks more efficiently. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The technologies and applications aiming at the dynamic properties of micro-level road traffic have made plenty of contributions for the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in past decades, which causes a lack of understanding and analysis for the dynamical properties of the whole structure at macro-level. Therefore, in this paper, we construct the Variable-Structure Dynamic Network modle (VSDN) and the Extended Variable-Structure Dynamic Network model (EVSDN) for urban road traffic systems, basing on the Level-Of-Service (LOS) and the traffic reachability. The VSDN model defines the edge set at any time includes only the edges whose LOS lies in un-congestion levels, which causes that the structure of the urban road traffic network varies with time. Furthermore, we extend VSDN to EVSDN that redefines the edge set to combine the micro-level time-varying characteristics into the macro-level topology. The experiments with traffic data and topology data of the Beijing road traffic system show that the EVSDN model is scale-free at some peak-time phases and the appearance of the scale-free property represents the significant change of topological features of urban road traffic networks. During rush hours, the scale-free property can be used to characterize urban road traffic networks.

We develop a method to solve the problem by combining the initial routes arrangement with the real-time route adjustment. The initial route planning is made by solving a time-dependent vehicle routing problem under recurrent congestion conditions. The genetic algorithm is applied. During the plan implementation, a new mechanism updating at the critical node is proposed to adjust the routes with real-time traffic information subject to the unexpected traffic accidents in non-recurrent congestion environment. Through the numerical simulation, the results show that the new route updating mechanism is more effective than others in the literatures, and the advantage by adopting the new mechanism becomes more prominent when the network becomes more dynamic.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

The congestion pricing models for two time periods (peak and off-peak) and two travel modes (car and bus) on a general urban highway network are constructed and are resolved by an excess-demand approach. A simulation study is conducted to analyze the temporal, spatial and modal effects of congestion tolls. Then the sensitivity analysis of key parameters is conducted to test the stability of the model. The main findings of this study are that congestion pricing schemes are effective in shifting peak time period traffic to the pre-peak time period; diverting traffic from tolled mode to untolled mode and from low occupancy vehicles to high occupancy vehicles. © ASCE.

By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which\ncan characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to\nstochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization\nproblem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - In this paper, the controllability and H∞ control method of urban transportation network are considered. Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - Route guidance and information systems are developed and popularly applied to help travelers to make route decisions today. Such devices can present information or give recommendations, so they have influence on the travelers travel choice in the traffic network. In this sense, the influence of guidance system on travelers’ route choice should be considered when the scenario of traffic network design is developed. However, few of existing traffic network design problem model considers the effect, and this motivates us to develop a Continuous Network Design (CNDP) model under a traffic network with guidance system. This study is based on the research of Jahn et al. (2005) to develop a single level program for CNDP under the traffic network with guidance system. The guidance system give advices to travelers based on system optimal rules with user constrains. From the result of simulation, it can be inferred that if the tolerance factor φ is properly chosen in our CNDP model, travelers all can decrease their travel time after network design than that they experienced at user equilibrium before network enhancement. That is to say, every traveler can profit from our CNDP scenario for proper tolerance factor φ.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - Many states in the USA attempt to manage urban growth so that development is directed to urban areas equipped to accommodate development, and rural lands are preserved for resource and other non-urban uses. The state of Oregon is entering its third decade of what many commentators describe as the nation's most aggressive urban growth management programme administered statewide. This article reports a recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the state urban growth management policies as they are implemented by the metropolitan Portland area. The metropolitan Portland area contains the largest population, employment and land base within a single urban growth boundary in the USA. Using primary data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the urban growth management and resource land preservation effort is assessed. Nearly all regional development has been directed to the urban growth boundary and away from resource lands. Many problems with administration are found, however. Policy implications are suggested.

AB  - Full article: Geneva, Switzerland, 26th July 2012—Statisticians from the University of Reading in partnership with TRAFFIC are helping in the global fight against the trade of illegal ivory, with a major revision of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), a global monitoring system for tracking illegal ivory trade.  With elephant poaching levels the worst they have been in a decade, and recorded ivory seizures at their highest levels since 1989, the revised system will give accurate and up-to-date information on the illegal trade of ivory. This will be of huge benefit for international and national policy makers on elephant conservation and on illicit trade who have previously struggled to get reliable and timely data.  At the heart of the upgrade is an innovative new database that allows countries to report seizures of illegal ivory online, making data entry easier and more accurate than ever before.  It will also encourage more countries to report illegal ivory trade as they will be able to access statistical summaries of their data and review other seizures where their country is implicated.  TRAFFIC manages ETIS on behalf of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is one of two elephant monitoring systems under CITES, the other being the Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) system.  The revised online ETIS will be showcased today at the CITES Standing Committee currently taking place in Geneva. In attendance will be representatives from many of the CITES Parties who will use the revised system. They will witness the functionality and the effectiveness of the database by way of a demonstration, ahead of its launch in September 2012.  Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood, statisticians from the University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, have worked closely with TRAFFIC to develop the revised ETIS. Dr Underwood, project leader, said: "We are very pleased that we are able to provide a solid statistical foundation to ETIS to ensure that it provides high quality and timely information on the illegal ivory trade at a crucial time for elephants." Recording illegal ivory seizures is just one aspect of the revised monitoring system, which now has enhanced capability to provide indicators of hidden illegal activity.  Applied Statistics Research Fellow Bob Burn, who conceived the current project and has been involved with ETIS since its inception in 1997, said: "Not all illegal ivory transactions are discovered or officially reported.  The challenge in analysing seizures data is to adjust for this gap by accounting for factors such as law enforcement effort and corruption. Using cutting edge statistical methods the monitoring system can now begin to combat this problem."  The statistical analyses will provide information on how patterns of illegal trade are changing over time and will identify problem countries so that attention can be focused upon those countries most heavily implicated in illicit trade. This provides crucial evidence for CITES and individual governments in their decision making when it comes to elephant conservation. The work was carried out under a Darwin Initiative project, led by the University of Reading, funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  UK Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: "These magnificent creatures are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers, and if we don't act now they may not have a future. This database, funded by Defra's Darwin Initiative, will accurately record illegal ivory seizures so we get a real picture of what is happening on the ground. This information can be shared around the world to help stop the illegal trade in ivory and put poachers out of business."  TRAFFIC's Tom Milliken, who manges ETIS, added: "Since 1997, our long-term collaboration with Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood from the University of Reading has progressively scaled up the science behind ETIS and made it a ‘best practice', state-of-the-art monitoring tool for the global conservation community.  TRAFFIC, but also elephants, trumpet their appreciation to Bob and Fiona and the Darwin Initiative!"  The database was developed in collaboration with Solertium Corporation, USA.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

The traffic assignment ratio matrix model integrates traffic status, topology and relation between links, with the dynamic traffic assignment ratios estimated by Linear Programming. The network-level traffic status is clustered by Self-Organizing Map and the typical patterns are discovered. The experiment proves the efficiency and applicability of this method for network-level traffic status modeling and analyzing.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Full article: Alor Star, Malaysia, 7th February 2013—A court case involving Malaysia’s biggest ever seizure of trafficked Tiger parts today saw the conviction of a 29-year old man, who was sentenced to a total 60 months in prison. However Mohd Nor Shahrizam Nasir, found guilty on two charges of illegal possession of Tiger parts and one for possession of African Elephant ivory, will only serve 24 months in jail as the judge ordered that his sentences run concurrently. A conviction under the section of the law involving Tiger parts also carries a mandatory fine of "not less than RM100,000 and not more than RM500,000 and a jail term not exceeding five years.” However, the court did not issue the mandatory fine. In February last year, he was arrested at this home where Wildlife Department officers found eight Tiger skins, 22 bags of Tiger skulls and bones and nine African Elephant tusks.  Mohd Nor Shahrizam, from the town of Alor Star in northern Peninsular Malaysia claimed trial to charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010. This morning he was handed down a sentence of 24 months each on the charges of keeping the eight Tiger skins, and the 22 Tiger skulls and bones. He received a further 12-month jail term on the third charge of keeping African Elephant tusks. Judge Mohd Rosli Osman granted the defence a stay pending an appeal and ordered that the convicted man’s bail, initially set at RM70,000, be increased by an additional RM10,000. If Mohd Nor Shahrizam raises bail, he will be free pending his appeal.   TRAFFIC welcomed the conviction but noted its concern that the sentence imposed contradicted the provision of the laws under which Mohd Nor Shahrizam was charged. “This is shocking given that the mandatory fine is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is also disappointing considering it has taken 13 years of hard work and the effort of so many to include a punitive minimum fine for heinous wildlife crimes,” said TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director Dr William Schaedla. TRAFFIC has learnt that the prosecution will seek a revision of the sentence. Schaedla also disagreed with the argument raised by the defence during the trial; that the crime in question was insignificant because it did not involve loss of life. “Such arguments fail to recognize that the arrest in this case was linked to the largest Tiger seizure Malaysia has ever seen – eight skins and the skulls and bones of 22 Tigers were impounded from the culprit’s Alor Star residence,” he said. “It also contradicts recent international developments that are putting wildlife crime on a par with other serious crimes such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking.” “The short jail term and the lack of a fine are a demoralizing finale to what should have been a victory against wildlife crime. We hope the lapse does not crush the spirit of those authorities who are still working hard to protect Malaysia’s 500 remaining Tigers.”

To verify the Dynamic-STARIMA modeling method in real situation, an experimental model is constructed to produce forecasting traffic flow for part of urban network in Beijing, China based on actual data. The prediction accuracy of Dynamic STARIMA model is generally satisfying compared to other forecasting methods, which testifies the advantage and practicability of the proposed model.

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting provides important information for both traffic control and traffic guidance. It should be both quick and accurate. A short-term traffic flow forecasting method is given based on the macroscopic urban traffic network model. The model is established to describe the substantial mechanism of traffic flow movement and the topology of the entire urban traffic network. It can simulate the traffic movement in the urban traffic network, and forecast the traffic flow states in the near future accurately. Also, the method has a good real-time feature due to the macroscopic model. In the simulation experiment, microscopic model CORSIM is used as the practical traffic system, and the proposed method is used to forecast the traffic flow of it. The simulation results show that the method has a good forecasting effectiveness.

AB  - In the context of serious congestion in most metropolitan areas and the development of intelligent transportation technology, variable message signs (VMS), as a part of route guidance system, are developed to alleviate congestion via providing drivers real-time travel information. It is expected that by providing dynamic travel time to drivers, both the congestion in network and average individual cost will be reduced. So getting the knowledge of the efficiency of a VMS system is important to researchers and designers. In order to evaluate the effects of variable message signs at urban network, a simulation-based, time-dependent traffic assignment model is proposed in this paper. The model uses a cell-based network loading model and the method of successive average algorithm to achieve stochastic user equilibrium at each sampling interval. A numerical example of the VMS system in Beijing is used to illustrate the effects of the variable message signs. The evaluation process is both based on network level and user level in situations of recurrent congestion and non-recurrent congestion. Finally a conclusion is drawn that the VMS system can alleviate congestion even if not all links in network are displayed by VMS.

The vertices of UTN are the road junctions or terminals and the edges are road segments. The Mobile Phone Network (MPN) around the UTN can also be represented as a graph say G/={T,E} with vertices T={t1,t2,t3.....,tl} and edges E={e1,e2.e3,…en} . The vertices t1,t2, t3.....,tl are the points on the road segments nearest to Base Transceiver Station (BTS) Cell centre and the edges e1,e2.e3,…en are the finite set of edges, same as the edges of UTN. In this paper, a method has been discussed to map a MPN onto a UTN. The mapping can be used for urban traffic management, such as counting the number of traffic users around a road junction. We have also stated and proved that “Any MPN graph can be constructed as an UTN graph”. Further, we have used the application of the mapping in counting traffic users to find the traffic congestion levels.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - Our research work concerns the development of a multimodal urban traffic simulator designed to be a tool of decision-making aid similar to a game wherein the user-player can test different scenarios by immersion in a 3D virtual city. Our approach is based on the activity-based model and the multi-agent technology. The implemented result is a hybrid simulator connecting numerical simulation and behavioural aspects coming from real data. This paper is focused on two points: firstly, we introduce how a final user (the traffic regulator) instantiates and assembles components so as to model a city and its urban traffic network; secondly, we present the use of Dempster-Shafer theory in the context of discrete choice modelling. Our approach manipulates input variables in order to test realistic representations of behaviours of agent categories in a decision-making process. The traffic modelling is based on a questionnaire elaborated from standard arrays of Taguchi. The significant variables and interactions are determined with the analysis of variance which suggests a reduced model describing the behaviour of a particular social category. The belief theory is used to take into account the doubt of some respondents as well as for the preferences redistribution if the number of alternatives changes. The effects of external traffic conditions are also quantified to choose a 'robust' alternative and to use the agents' memory.

AB  - With the increase in deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) within the Gulf States to improve road network management, there is an opportunity for many benefits to be realised by integrating such systems on a local and cross-border level. This paper details the primary benefits for integrating urban and inter-urban traffic management from a road operator' perspective, but there is also a secondary and very crucial benefit that is also available from the same systems, i.e. integrated traffic information services for the traveller. This can add value to the travelling public in order to improve the overall journey experience. This paper describes the work done in this area in Europe and discusses why and how a similar approach can be taken by the Gulf States to tackle congestion, improve road safety and allow efficient road usage. The paper covers how integration of ITS systems in participating countries in Europe enables the sharing of traffic data via standardised methods. Using standards and principles such as Urban Traffic Management and Control (UTMC), DATEX II and Travel Information Highway (TIH) has meant that a lot of significant work has been undertaken in this area. A similar concept can be adopted for the Gulf countries. Finally, the paper addresses the types of ITS data sources that provide the information to the road operator for network management and the methods of delivering traffic information to the public. &copy; 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, London.

Concerning urban and regional development, it seems that the effect of agglomeration economies has been extensively studied, but very little attention has been paid to the contribution from the economies of network. This paper attempts to show that regional development is not only brought about by the economies of urban agglomeration, but also that it results from the transportation network. It presents a theoretical model for analysing the relationship between the economies of network and urban agglomeration, and regional development. Meanwhile, it also provides some empirical evidence from the Japanese regional economies.

AB  - Along with the development of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic\ndetectors collect numerous transportation state data in information\ndatabases and accumulate. Such data is greatly meaningful to the vehicle\nnavigation. In this paper, we propose a noble two-stage algorithm about\nvehicle navigation by using data mining methods on the historical and\ncurrent transportation dataset. This algorithm begins with picking\nsensitive data about start and end point in an urban traffic network,\nand data from related (or nearest) road fragments. Referring to current\ntime and season, the algorithm gives an evaluation to every related road\nfragments and outputs a most reasonable route between start and end\npoint. The experimental and theoretical analyzes show that this\nalgorithm can form an efficient and effective route in reasonable time.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks (TNs) for control purposes. A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets (CTPNs) is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized TN systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, ordinary timed Petri nets model the signal timing plans of the traffic lights controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The existing network traffic signal optimization formulations usually do not include traffic flow models, except for control schemes such as {SCOOT} (Split, Cycle, and Offset Optimization Technique) system that uses simulation for heuristic optimization. Other conventional models normally use isolated intersection optimization with traffic arrival prediction using detector information, or optimization schemes based on green bandwidth approach such as {MAXBAND} (Maximal Bandwidth). In this paper we present a complete formulation of the problem that includes explicit constraints to model the movement of traffic along the streets between the intersections in a time-expanded network, as well as constraints to capture the permitted movements from modern signal controllers. The platoon dispersion model used is the well-known Robertson's model, which forms linear constraints. Thus it is a rare example of a traffic simulation being analytically embedded in an optimization formulation. The formulation is an integer-linear program, and does not assume fixed cycle lengths or phase sequences. It assumes full information on external inputs, but can be incorporated in a sensor-based environment, as well as in a feedback control framework. The formulation is an integer-linear program that may not be efficiently solved with standard simplex and branch and bound techniques. We discuss network programming formulations to handle the linear platoon dispersion equations and the integer constraints at the intersections. A special-purpose network simplex algorithm for fast solution is also mentioned.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new\nand redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is\nconcerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway)\nnetwork users. This paper presents a hi-level optimization model-in\nwhich the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first\ntime-for solving the public transportation network redesign problem\n(PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total\ncost, including user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost,\nfor the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource-\nand policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user\nself-routing optimization problem in which all transit users try to find\nthe transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number\nof transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic\nalgorithm-based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP hi-level\noptimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical\nresults are described. Future research directions are also given.

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities grow—their shape and size—will have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growth—that is, transportation routes, land use, and topography—were directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study site—St Louis, Missouri—to predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naïve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naïve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the models’ performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth.

In addition to the formulation of the mathematical structure of the model, the paper reports on the development of the solution algorithm, and some preliminary tests indicating rapid model convergence and minimal computational costs. These tests also reveal that transportation energy cost is an important variable in determining metropolitan structure and the location of urban activities.

AB  - Many approaches had been proposed for travel time prediction in these decades; most of them focus on the predicting the travel time on freeway or simple arterial network. Travel time prediction for urban network in real time is hard to achieve for several reasons: complexity and path routing problem in urban network, unavailability of real-time sensor data, spatiotemporal data coverage problem, and lacking real-time events consideration. In this paper, we propose a knowledge based real-time travel time prediction model which contains real-time and historical travel time predictors to discover traffic patterns from the raw data of location based services by data mining technique and transform them to travel time prediction rules. Besides, dynamic weight combination of the two predictors by meta-rules is proposed to provide a real-time traffic event response mechanism to enhance the precision of the travel time prediction.

AB  - This paper proposes an equilibrium system model for analyzing urban traffic congestion problems. According to the traffic equilibrium theory, each link on the traffic network has an optimal capacity to achieve equilibrium, with matching grade and settings. Traffic congestion occurs when capacity appears to decrease, when the road's capacity is less than the traffic demands. In order to find out all the congestion links on the network, a hierarchical model is established according to the network structure and road category scale; it includes the main roads and the branches. Comparing the road's optimal matching capacity and the real capacity, we computed the difference. For each link, if the optimal matching capacity was greater than the real capacity, it would need to be widened or reconstructed. For the whole network, the matching degree reflects the compatibility of the road supply and transportation demand. The traffic congestion diagnostic process should encompass the whole network down to a partial road; the bottlenecks would be a indicated by point, a line, or even an area, where congestion occurs. In the paper, we discuss the measurement of the congestion, the congestion degree on the link and the matching degree of the network. The congestion degree shows the severity of the problem, while the matching degree explains the efficiency of the network. This model describes the conflict between road supply and transportation demand, from macrocosm to microcosm. It, moreover, finds the discrepancy in the road network, and gives some reference for the urban transportation infrastructure construction and planning. © ASCE.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

The foundation of the algorithm is that an actual road network has its particular spatial distribution features, and GIS has strong visual editing functions for transportation network. According to the size of the transportation network, with the GIS platform SuperMap, we partition the network into a certain amount of rectangular blocks, and then according to the starting node and the destination node, the searching area of the algorithm is restricted reasonably. With the actual example given, the experimental results prove the high operational efficiency and strong practicality of the new algorithm.

AB  - To effectively alleviate traffic pressure of urban arterial roads, optimizing one-way traffic organization is the key to bring microcirculation transportation network into full play. Aiming at reducing the saturation of arterial roads and microcirculation roads, the paper develops the bi-level programming model for optimizing one-way traffic organization with consideration of the maximum saturation restriction. The decision-making variable of the upper level programming is the scheme of one-way traffic organization of branch roads and the optimization targets are to minimize the average saturation of arterial roads and to minimize the excess of saturation over its maximum of arterial roads. The lower level programming is an equilibrium traffic assignment problem under the restrictions of the capacity of arterial roads and branch roads and the maximum saturation. The genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the model. The traffic conditions of arterial roads and microcirculation roads before and after optimizing of one-way traffic organization were compared by an example, which also proves the effectiveness of one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network. The proposed model provides an optimization method for one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network.

This paper addresses the problem of how to determine the optimal locations of cameras for best traffic surveillance in urban road networks. All users are divided into multiple classes according to their own acceptance degree of camera monitoring (ADOCM). A bi-level programming model for camera location problem (CLP) is introduced. The objective of upper level problem is to maximize the total observed traffic flow from the viewpoint of network planners. The lower level problem is to depict the logit-based stochastic route choice behavior of users. The method of successive averages (MSA) and Frank Wolfe algorithm are employed to solve the problem. Numerical examples show the managerial insight that the behavior against camera monitoring has brought considerable loss to network traffic surveillance.

AB  - Incident-induced traffic congestion is a critical issue in formulation urban traffic congestion problems. This paper presents a method which serves to alleviate incident-induced traffic congestion for urban traffic network. The proposed approach includes two major parts: models and optimal control algorithm. Based on the typical phase types in Chinese cities, calculation models for controlled flow at intersection exit lanes, for movement offsets, for delay and queue of each movement, and for delay and queue of links adjacent to incident location were formulated respectively. Movement was the basic unit when delay and queue were calculated. Then a real-code genetic algorithm was presented to implement the optimal control under incident condition, in which we used a penalty function to ensure constraints. In the preliminary test, eight optimization strategies were chosen for the network control. The result showed that the total delay could decrease approximately 20% even if no vehicle diversion was considered under incident condition.
