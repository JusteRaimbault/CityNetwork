AB  - We present empirical evidence that land values are scale free and introduce a network model that reproduces the observations. The network approach to urban modeling is based on the assumption that the market dynamics that generates land values can be represented as a growing scale-free network. Our results suggest that the network properties of trade between specialized activities cause land values, and likely also other observables such as population, to be power-law distributed. In addition to being an attractive avenue for further analytical inquiry, the network representation is also applicable to empirical data and is thereby attractive for predictive modeling.

AB  - Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate statistical framework that is used to model complex relationships between directly and indirectly observed (latent) variables. SEM is a general framework that involves simultaneously solving systems of linear equations and encompasses other techniques such as regression, factor analysis, path analysis, and latent growth curve modeling. Recently, SEM has gained popularity in the analysis of complex genetic traits because it can be used to better analyze the relationships between correlated variables (traits), to model genes as latent variables as a function of multiple observed genetic variants, and assess the association between multiple genetic variants and multiple correlated phenotypes of interest. Though the general SEM framework only allows for the analysis of independent observations, recent work has extended SEM for the analysis of general pedigrees. Here, we review the theory of SEM for both unrelated and family data, the available software for SEM, and provide an example of SEM analysis.

AB  - In the reliable network design problem (RNDP) the main sources of\nuncertainty are variable demand and route choice. The objective is to\nmaximize network total travel time reliability (TTR), which is defined\nas the probability that the network total travel time will be less than\na threshold. A framework is presented for a stochastic network model\nwith Poisson-distributed demand and uncertain route choice. The\ntravelers are assumed to choose their routes to minimize their perceived\nexpected travel cost following the probit stochastic user equilibrium\ncondition. An analytical method is presented for approximation of the\nfirst and second moments of the total travel time. These moments are\nthen fitted with a log-normal distribution. Then the design problem is\ntackled in which the analytical derivative of the TTR is derived with\nthe sensitivity analysis of the equilibrated path choice probability.\nThis derivative is then supplied to a gradient-based optimization\nalgorithm to solve the RNDP. The algorithm is tested with a small\nnetwork example.

AB  - Spatially land use models are indispensable for sustainable land use planning. This study demonstrates a combined Markov-Cellular Automata model to analyze temporal change and spatial distribution of land use stressed by natural and socioeconomic factors in Saga, Japan. Firstly, area change and spatial distribution of land use are calculated using GIS technology, and then the transition among different land use types is analyzed to obtain the transformation matrices during a period of 1976-2006. Meanwhile, an integration evaluation procedure with natural and socioeconomic data is used to generate the transition potential maps. Secondly, using the transition potential maps and transition matrices, a Markov-Cellular Automata model is established to simulate spatial distribution of land use in 2006. Finally, we use this Markov-Cellular Automata model to forecast the future land use changes during the period of 2015-2042. As a consequence, area change simulation predicts a continuing downward trend in agriculture land and forestland areas, as well as an upward trend in built-up areas; spatial distribution simulation indicates that built-up land will expand toward suburban regions, and land use of urban center is at the decline stage. Hence, if the current trends keep constant without holistic sustainable development measures, severe land use decline will ensue. The study is anticipated to help local authorities better understand and address a complex land use system, and develop the improved land use management strategies that can better balance urban expansion and ecological conservation. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This review is divided into two sections, the first section reviews the early models that are rooted in transportation and land-use planning and form the foundation on which nearly all modeling efforts are based. These models are already well documented in the literature and an overview here is sufficient. In the second section, an exploration is made into the theories and approaches that have been integrated into urban modeling efforts. The concepts are outlined and one or more contemporary examples are highlighted. These theories and approaches represent the major areas of development that exist in published work.

AB  - In the global context, the population of cities and urbanized areas has developed from a minority to become the majority. Now cities are the largest, most complex and most dynamic man-made systems. They are vibrant centres of cultural life and engines that drive local and global economies. Yet, contemporary urbanized areas are environmentally, socially and economically unsustainable entities laying increasing pressure on the surrounding rural areas. Traditional methods of planning and managing large cities that lead to this situation have reached their limits. The planning and design processes therefore need a radical re-thinking. On the computational side, this necessitates the integration of new methods and instruments. On the planning and design side, this requires the involvement of stakeholders and decision makers much earlier than normally done in the past. The combination of interactive design and computation will demonstrate the effects and side effects of urban-rural planning or re-development. We build our design research approach on dynamics and scale: viewing cities and settlements as entities with dynamic urban metabolisms, we propose to apply stocks and flows simulations to the building scale (small, S-Scale), to the urban scale (medium, M-Scale), and to the territorial scale (large, L-Scale). Our long-term goal is the sustainable urban-rural system. Planning and implementation examples from Switzerland and ETH Zurich Science City serve as test cases, with the intent to use the findings for developments in other parts of the world.

This paper reviews the latest use of smart cards in securing network, online services, operating systems, and card-holder identity. Smart card network authentication is routinely used on GSM and 3G networks, and this paper shows how the same infrastructure can be extended to perform WiFi access point authentication. Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication. Finally, the paper will show how smart cards and trusted platform module have complementary roles for recuring the operating systems, and the use of smart cards in identity frameworks such as liberty alliance or Microsoft cardspace.

AB  - Urban areas can contain rich flora that contribute significantly to biodiversity, but loss and isolation of habitats due to urban sprawl threaten biodiversity and warrant limits on development. The connectivity provided by urban green spaces offers habitats and corridors that help conserve biodiversity. Researchers and planners have begun using landscape ecology principles to develop green space networks and increase connectivity to preserve and restore biodiversity. In this paper, potential corridors were identified in Jinan City, China, using the least-cost path method, and green space networks were developed and improved based on graph theory and the gravity model. Spatial analysis revealed that the proposed plan decreased fragmentation and increased connectivity. Plaza and roadside green spaces were the main types of green space that increased, but they only weakly improved networks and biodiversity. Identifying potential corridors using least-cost path analysis made the results better approximate the real landscape by including impedance along links. The potential networks revealed problems in the current greening plan. The green space network developed based on graph theory and the gravity model simplified and systematized the complex landscape, helping to identify the significance of each green space and guiding urban planning for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - In this paper I build on current research in urban and ecological simulation modeling to develop a conceptual framework for modeling the urban ecosystem. Although important progress has been made in various areas of urban modeling, operational urban models are still primitive in terms of their ability to represent ecological processes. On the other hand, environmental models designed to assess the ecological impact of an urban region are limited in their ability to represent human systems. I present here a strategy to integrate these two lines of research into an urban ecological model (UEM). This model addresses the human dimension of the Puget Sound regional integrated simulation model (PRISM)—a multidisciplinary initiative at the University of Washington aimed at developing a dynamic and integrated understanding of the environmental and human systems in the Puget Sound. UEM simulates the environmental pressures associated with human activities under alternative demographic, economic, policy, and environmental scenarios. The specific objectives of UEM are to: quantify the major sources of human-induced environmental stresses (such as land-cover changes and nutrient discharges); determine the spatial and temporal variability of human stressors in relation to changes in the biophysical structure; relate the biophysical impacts of these stressors to the variability and spatial heterogeneity in land uses, human activities, and management practices; and predict the changes in stressors in relation to changes in human factors.

AB  - Clustering was usually applied on numerical and categorical information. However, textual information is acquiring an increasing importance with the appearance of methods for textual data mining. This paper proposes the use of classical clustering algorithms with a mixed function that combines numerical, categorical and semantic features. The content of the semantic features is extracted from textual data. This paper analyses and compares the behavior of different existing semantic similarity functions that use WordNet as background ontology. The different partitions obtained with the clustering algorithm are compared to human classifications in order to see which one approximates better the human reasoning. Moreover, the interpretability of the obtained clusters is discussed. The results show that those similarity measures that provide better results when compared using a standard benchmark also provide better and more interpretable partitions.

AB  - We present a method for interactive procedural generation of parcels within the urban modeling pipeline. Our approach performs a partitioning of the interior of city blocks using user-specified subdivision attributes and style parameters. Moreover, our method is both robust and persistent in the sense of being able to map individual parcels from before an edit operation to after an edit operation - this enables transferring most, if not all, cus- tomizations despite small to large-scale interactive editing operations. The guidelines guarantee that the resulting subdivisions are functionally and geometrically plausible for subsequent building modeling and construction. Our results include visual and statistical comparisons that demonstrate how the parcel configurations created by our method can closely resemble those found in real-world cities of a large variety of styles. By directly addressing the block subdivision problem, we intend to increase the editability and realism of the urban modeling pipeline and to become a standard in parcel generation for future urban modeling methods.

It is argued here that there is no general straightforward relation between the degree distribution on one hand and structural aspects on the other hand, as this relation depends on further characteristics of the presumed model for the network. Therefore empirical inference from observed network characteristics to the processes that could be responsible for network genesis and dynamics cannot be based only, or mainly, on the observed degree distribution.

AB  - A geographic information system (GIS) was a useful aid in the assessment of urban nonpoint source pollution and the development of a pollution control strategy. The GIS was used for data integration and display, and to provide data for a nonpoint source model. An empirical nonpoint source loading model driven by land use was used to estimate pollutant loadings of priority pollutants. Pollutant loadings were estimated at fine spatial resolution adn aggregated to storm sewer drainage basins (sewersheds). Eleven sewersheds were generated from digital versions of sewer maps. The pollutant loadings of individual land use polygons, derived as the units of analysis from street blocks, were aggregated to get total polutant loadings within each sewershed. Based on the model output, a critical sewershed was located. Pollutant loadings at major sewer junctions within the critical sewershed were extimated to develop a mitigation strategy. Two approaches based on the installation of wet ponds were investigated -- a regional approach using one large wet pond at the major sewer outfall and a multisite approach using a number of smaller sites for each major sewer junction. Cost analyses showed that the regional approach would be more cost effective, though it would provide less pollution control.

First the simulated annealing algorithm with the best reserve mechanism is introduced and it is organic combined with Powell algorithm to form improved simulated annealing mixed optimize algorithm, instead of gradient falling algorithm of BP network to train network weight. It can get higher accuracy and faster convergence speed. We construct the network structure, and give the algorithm flow. The main parameters of affecting urban logistics demand are studied. With the ability of strong self-learning and faster convergence of ISANN, the modeling and forecasting method can truly forecast the logistics demand.

AB  - Computer graphics and its broader application as visualization are at last beginning to have an impact on the ways analysts and model builders articulate and communicate their intellectual understanding of urban systems. Geographic information systems (GIS) lie in the vanguard of these developments and there is presently much effort in linking these systems to traditional spatial models so that the power of GIS databases and display capabilities can be harnessed. To demonstrate the import of these ideas, a prototypical visual environment has been developed for such modeling and in this paper it is shown how it can be implemented. The elements of such visualization are first defined in terms of the model-based processes which characterize applications, emphasizing data exploration, model calibration, prediction, and prescription. These processes are then concentrated through model inputs, outputs, and causal structures, illustrating the operation of various model sectors through different modes of spatial statistical and graphic analysis. These ideas are implemented through windowing systems which mix text, numerics, and graphics, and are illustrated using an elementary model of residential location of Melbourne, Australia. The operation of the model in a UNIX environment which is accessed through proprietary windows-based software is demonstrated, thus providing a platform to discuss the problems of linking conventional model-based techniques to graphics software in general, GIS in particular. The paper is concluded with a sketch for future work.

AB  - This study applied logistic regression to model urban growth in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area of Georgia in a GIS environment and to discover the relationship between urban growth and the driving forces. Historical land use/cover data of Atlanta were extracted from the 1987 and 1997 Landsat TM images. Multi-resolution calibration of a series of logistic regression models was conducted from 50 m to 300 m at intervals of 25 m. A fractal analysis pointed to 225 m as the optimal resolution of modeling. The following two groups of factors were found to affect urban growth in different degrees as indicated by odd ratios: (1) population density, distances to nearest urban clusters, activity centers and roads, and high/low density urban uses (all with odds ratios < 1); and (2) distance to the CBD, number of urban cells within a 7 ?? 7 cell window, bare land, crop/grass land, forest, and UTM northing coordinate (all with odds ratios > 1). A map of urban growth probability was calculated and used to predict future urban patterns. Relative operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.85 indicates that the probability map is valid. It was concluded that despite logistic regression's lack of temporal dynamics, it was spatially explicit and suitable for multi-scale analysis, and most importantly, allowed much deeper understanding of the forces driving the growth and the formation of the urban spatial pattern. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Applications of a range of generator models are discussed and treated. The manner in which generator saturation is treated in stability studies, both in the initialization process as well as during large or small disturbance stability analysis procedures is addressed. Saturation functions that are derived, whether from test data or by the methods, of finite elements are developed. Different saturation algorithms for calculating values of excitation and internal power angle depending upon generator terminal conditions are compared. The question of parameter determination is covered. Two approaches in accounting for generator field and excitation system base quantities are identified. Conversion factors are given for transferring field parameters from one base to another for correct generator/excitation system interface modeling, Suggestions for modeling of negative field currents and other field circuit discontinuities are included.

It is vital that the scientific planning of urban logistics park will ensure China's rapid development. However, too many inappropriate or unscientific planning and construction under the guidance of Government have brought giant economic loss to China. How to plan and design the urban logistics park scientifically, It is a hot topic of research being widely discussed not only by Governments but also enterprisers and scholars home and abroad. This paper begins with exploratory research for modeling and planning on the urban logistics park location selection based on the BP Artificial Neural Network (BP ANN). This paper divides into 3 sections: the first to mainly introduce the history of urban logistics park development and the significance of modelling and planning urban logistics park, the second to analyze basic principle of the BP ANN, the third to simulate and plan the location selection of urban logistics park based on the BP ANN model. The urban logistics park's location selection planning is a complicated and dynamical system engineering with a lot of black box problems, which can't be resloved by System Dynamics, Expert System and traditional mathematical methods (e.g. Operations Research, Statistics), and BP ANN model has seldom been applied to plan urban logistics park in China.

AB  - Literature suggests that present urban design plans and methods are inadequate to deal with the scale and complexity of contemporary urban form and multidisciplinary collaborative practice. Although recent developments in urban modeling technologies have brought about a wide range of different techniques and potential implementations that may help address this inadequacy, they have not yet made their desired impact on the design process. Failure to use these capabilities extensively in actual practice may result primarily from a limited understanding of the proper role these tools should play or the impact they may have. There is also hesitation about which are appropriate and effective applications, and little consensus on the methods with which these capabilities should be used in core design activities. More investigation is needed to understand fully their application in urban design practice. This research suggests a methodological framework underlying the methods of using various urban modeling functionalities. A questionnaire survey method was used to document the methods and assess the extents to which designers used urban modeling tools in developing eight urban design plans. The questionnaire survey findings were compared with the theoretical premises. The findings showed that design methodology is the main factor that affects the effectiveness of modeling to support design activities. The findings showed extensive, inconsistent usage and various degrees of support for design activities that resulted in various degrees of impact on urban design aspects. The findings suggest the provision of dynamic visualization supported by efficient networking may advance urban modeling to become a tool of public advocacy and design decision support which can advance urban design practice to informational, communicational, and representational systems.

The models generate a hazard assessment map comprised of polygons which represent the results of quantitative multivariate analysis. The system allows for future adjustment of one or all of the parameters as policy is implemented and hazardous conditions are mitigated. This features provides a mechanism for accounting and feedback allowing for the appraisal of the success of mitigation.

The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - Spatially explicit urban expansion models that can trace urban development in the past and predict the expansion scenarios in the future are indispensable for examining urban planning policies. This paper demonstrates a new urban expansion scenario (UES) model by coupling one "bottom-up" cellular automata (CA)-based model and one "top-down" system dynamics (SD)-based model. By implementing the UES model in Beijing, the urban evolution from 1991 to 2004 was simulated and the UESs from 2004 to 2020 were predicted. The results suggest that a dilemma of urban expansion versus limited water resource and environment deterioration exists. Dealing with such a dilemma remains a challenge for the local government. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - This paper presents an urban modeling system using CAD/GIS data for atmosphere environmental simulation, such as wind flow and contaminant spread in urban area. The CAD data is used for the shape modeling for the high-storied buildings and civil structures with complicated shape since the data for that is not included in the 3D-GIS data accurately. The unstructured mesh based on the tetrahedron element is employed in order to express the urban structures with complicated shape accurately. It is difficult to understand the quality of shape model and mesh by the conventional visualization technique. In this paper, the stereoscopic visualization using virtual reality (VR) technology is employed for the verification of the quality of shape model and mesh. The present system is applied to the atmosphere environmental simulation in urban area and is shown to be an useful planning and design tool to investigate the atmosphere environmental problem. ?? 2008 Tsinghua University Press.

AB  - The development of urban green space networks includes creation of new spatial forms, restoration and maintenance of green patches connectivity as well as protection of existing green spaces. Green space network begins to be recognized as a medium of conserving ecosystem and natural environment in urban area. Several methods have been introduced in regards to formulation of modeling urban green space network. This research paper reviews several methods that are used for modeling green space network in urban planning. Recently, remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) are being used to produce a model of urban green space network which positively afford nature conservation in city.

AB  - This paper proposes a method that facilitates urban water demand modeling estimations where the costumer information system (CIS) is lacking or inadequate, based on a geographic information system (GIS). This method determines a per capita water supply based on socioeconomic status, according to the urban marginalization classification defined for each geo-statical basic area (AGEB), provided by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in Mexico. For the year of study, 2005, a comparison between water demands estimation by the. Toluca, Mexico, city water agency and this method based on AGEBs information has been done. It can be concluded that problems like an inadequate water distribution could be solved through spatial representations of projected demand. Thus, the water supply strategy design includes an appropriate control tool for the planning and management of water resources. Furthermore, projection and supply water flow monitoring will allow the analysis of water needs by type of use and its reduction within a water-saving culture framework.

AB  - KEY WORDS: surface temperature, anisotropy, urban climate, sensor-view model Thermal remote sensing of urban areas is affected by directional variations (anisotropy) of the upwelling thermal radiation. The anisotropy arises due to the three-dimensionally rough urban surface that creates microscale patterns of surface temperature variability associated with surface position, orientation and composition, coupled with a biased view of this rough surface by the remote sensor. The large magnitudes of observed urban thermal anisotropy suggest it can be a significant factor in the interpretation of urban surface characteristics such as the surface urban heat island and application of urban surface temperatures to modelling urban surface heat fluxes. Here we couple the SUM urban surface sensor view model (Soux et al. 2004) with the urban canopy energy balance model of Mills (1997) and a newly developed three-dimensional energy balance model to investigate the variability of thermal anisotropy with surface geometric parameters. Relatively large anisotropy is modelled for realistic urban H/W ratios, and realistic plan area ratios generate a 30% variability of the thermal anisotropy over urban surfaces. Coupled simulations with both energy balance models yielded similar results for anisotropy in the case study examined. The simulations substantially under-estimated the anisotropy compared to observations from a helicopter-mounted thermal scanner despite showing good agreement between modelled and observed temperature differences between major urban surface facets. This suggests the simplified urban surface geometry used by the models is inadequate to replicate the observed anisotropy.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This report documents a Newton formulation of MODFLOW-2005, called MODFLOW-NWT. MODFLOW- NWT is a standalone program that is intended for solving problems involving drying and rewetting nonlinearities of the unconfined groundwater-flow equation. MODFLOW- NWT must be used with the Upstream-Weighting (UPW) Package for calculating intercell conductances in a different manner than is done in the Block-Centered Flow (BCF), Layer Property Flow (LPF), or Hydrogeologic-Unit Flow (HUF; Anderman and Hill, 2000) Packages. TheUPW Package treats nonlinearities of cell drying and rewetting by use of a continuous function of groundwater head, rather than the discrete approach of drying and rewetting that is used by the BCF, LPF, and HUF Packages. This further enables application of the Newton formulation for unconfined groundwater-flow problems because conductance derivatives required by the Newton method are smooth over the full range of head for a model cell. The NWT linearization approach generates an asymmetric matrix, which is different from the standard MODFLOW formulation that generates a symmetric matrix. Because all linear solvers presently available for use with MODFLOW-2005 solve only symmetric matrices, MODFLOW-NWT includes two previously developed asymmetric matrix-solver options. The matrix-solver options include a generalized-minimum-residual (GMRES) Solver and an Orthomin / stabilized conjugate-gradient (CGSTAB) Solver. The GMRES Solver is documented in a previously published report, such that only a brief description and input instructions are provided in this report. However, the CGSTAB Solver (called χMD) is documented in this report. Flow-property input for the UPW Package is designed based on the LPF Package and material-property input is identical to that for the LPF Package except that the rewetting and vertical-conductance correction options of the LPF Package are not available with the UPW Package. Input files constructed for the LPF Package can be used with slight modification as input for the UPW Package. This report presents the theory and methods used by MODFLOW-NWT,including the UPW Package. Additionally, this report provides comparisons of the new methodology to analytical solutions of groundwater flow and to standard MODFLOW-2005 results by use of an unconfined aquifer MODFLOW example problem. The standard MODFLOW-2005 simulation uses the LPF Package with the wet/dry option active. A new example problem also is presented to demonstrate MODFLOW- NWT’s ability to provide a solution for a difficult unconfined groundwater-flow problem.

AB  - Urban street patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and detail-independent mechanism may be in action.We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggest that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follows a simple universal mechanism.

AB  - The modern city is a complex system with large amount of information. Discovering the hidden causal relationships among urban operational factors is a key research issue in city planning. Traditional approaches that concentrate on one aspect (e.g. transport) may have limitation when the city planning needs holistic analysis and an interoperable view of the city system. We introduce a systematic factor analysis approach for urban information by using Bayesian Network (BN) framework. We build a BN structure to present the causal relationships among city information factors based on integrated data sets. In addition, our approach is a dynamic modeling method because the learned BN structure will change in different time periods depends on the different service that the city provides. With structural leaning and real time monitoring, we perform Bayesian inference on the BN structure and the transformation of BN structure. We provide high level views to planners in the sense that identifying the potential cause or outcome of a city operational factor and examining the implementation of certain policies. Opinions from city planning experts may help us improve our model.

AB  - In urban systems modeling, there are many elaborate dynamic models based on intricate decision processes whose simulation must be based on customized software if their space-time properties are to be explored effectively. In this paper we present a class of urban models whose dynamics are based on theories of development associated with cellular automata (CA), whose data is fine-grained, and whose simulation requires software which can handle an enormous array of spatial and temporal model outputs. We first introduce the generic problem of modeling within GIS, noting relevant CA models before outlining a generalized model based on Xie's (1996, A general model for cellular urban dynamics. Geographical Analysis, 28, 350-373) "dynamic urban evolutionary modeling" (DUEM) approach. We present ways in which land uses are structured through their life cycles, and ways in which existing urban activities spawn locations for new activities. We define various decision rules that embed distance and direction, density thresholds, and transition or mutation probabilities into the model's dynamics, and we then outline the software designed to generate effective urban simulations consistent with GIS data inputs, outputs and related functionality. Finally, we present a range of hypothetical urban simulations that illustrate the diversity of model types that can be handled within the framework as a prelude to more realistic applications which will be reported in later papers.

AB  - Constrained cellular automata (CA) are frequently used for modeling land use change and urban growth. In these models land use dynamics are generated by a set of cell state transition rules that incorporate a neighborhood effect. Generally, neighborhoods are relatively small and therefore only a limited amount of spatial information is included. In this study a variable grid CA is implemented to allow incorporation of more spatial information in a computationally efficient way. This approach aggregates land uses at greater distances, in accordance with a hierarchical concept of space. More remote areas are aggregated into consecutively larger areas. Therefore the variable grid CA is capable of simulating regional as well as local dynamics at the same time. The variable grid CA is used here to model urban growth in the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) between 1996 and 2001. Calibration results are tested for goodness of fit at the cellular level by means of the kappa statistic and for land use patterns by means of cluster size analysis and radial analysis. Kappa results show that the model performs considerably better than a neutral allocation model. Cluster and radial analysis indicate that the model is capable of producing realistic urban growth patterns. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to resolve the problems on the current 3D modeling method of urban underground pipeline network, we present a novel algorithm based on a 3D component library in this paper. The algorithm, introduces the concept of 3D component library, makes the 3D models of standard pipe fittings as element components and splits the complex 3D model of the underground pipeline network into several element components. The element components are classified by type and stored in the 3D component library. When construct the underground pipe network 3D models, firstly, gets the element components by the type ID of 2D entities, then through the approach that the combination of different element components, we can obtain the accurate 3D models. Comparing with the traditional 3D modeling method of urban underground pipeline network, this new algorithm is more lifelike and accurate. The system based on the method can improve the efficiency of its development and the reusability of its resource. This new algorithm also provides a common solution for a complex 3D model, which can construct the 3D model of complex urban facilities, such as overpass.

AB  - The problem of traffic congestion is attracting lots of attention with the aim of investigating efficient solutions. To achieve models that comprehensively describe the system, useful data from the network is needed. A suggestion is to mount detectors in selected regions and study the system responses to various stimuli. This, however, might be costly and impractical in many cases. Traffic simulators are beneficial tools for providing a simulated environment of the network. The current study tries to develop a traffic simulator within NetLogo, an agent-based environment. Using this simulator, the effect of different light plans on average delay time (ADT) of vehicles is investigated. The results indicate that in a normal-sized network a better choice is the simultaneous change of lights. A long length is appropriate for low entering frequencies and an average length is more efficient for high entering frequencies. In geometrically bigger networks, lights are better to change every other one with an average length for low entering frequencies and a long length for high entering frequencies.

AB  - ssung The TRNSYS (TRaNsient SYstems Simulations) Hybrid Lighting Model was revised so that two colorimetric indices pertinent to indoor illumination, the correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI), could be predicted by the model. For calculation of the CCT and CRI relevant to the hybrid lighting system, the spectral power density (SPD) of beam normal radiation was needed. Though TRNSYS provides algorithms to calculate the magnitude of beam normal radiation on any surface, no methods were provided in TRNSYS to determine the SPD of solar radiation. This thesis describes the inclusion of a spectral model in TRNSYS: Gueymard's SMARTS2 (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) algorithm. This algorithm was used to calculate the SPD of beam normal radiation as a function of solar position, atmospheric turbidity, moisture content, and other atmospheric parameters. The TRNSYS hybrid lighting model, augmented by SMARTS2, was used to analyze building illumination and energy loads for a 2500 m2 office building equipped with a hybrid lighting system (HLS). The HLS uses two-axis tracking collectors to collect beam normal radiation that is later divided into visible and infrared components. The visible radiation is piped to luminaires inside the building using optical fibers, while the infrared radiation is focused on thermal photovoltaic arrays and used to generate electricity. The TRNSYS model calculated annual building energy loads (lighting, cooling, and heating) and energy savings in office buildings located in six U.S. cities: Honolulu, HI; Tucson, AZ; Reno, NV; Atlanta, GA; Seattle, WA; and Madison, WI; that were equipped with hybrid lighting systems. Using local utility rates and assuming 52 lm/W lamps efficacies (the commercial average in the U.S.), the annual energy savings per m2 collector area in these cities were: $240-Tucson, $140-Reno, $320-Honolulu, $40- Atlanta, $50-Madison, and $60-Seattle. For the colorimetry analysis, four representative lamp SPDs - warm white fluorescent, full spectrum fluorescent, tungsten incandescent, and halogen incandescent - were defined as standard indoor light source spectrums. Two cities were chosen to perform the analyses in: Tucson, which represented a clear climate with consistent beam normal radiation values, and Seattle, a cloudier climate. The CCT and CRI were calculated each hour during office working hours. When cloudy, the CCT and CRI of the illumination inside took on the values of the lamp providing it, but when beam normal radiation was available these values were influenced by the 5000-5500 K CCT and 80 CRI of the beam normal radiation transmitted though the HLS. Histograms showing the number of hours at varying CCT and CRI ranges for different locations and with different lamps are presented in Chapter 7.

To be sure, an input-output model is most often the only option for planners in very small regions (West, 1995). Aside from their complexity, the limited use of regional CGE models in practice likely stems from deficiencies in their current formulation, implementation, and description. Therefore, this chapter focuses on what needs to be done for CGE models to become more widely used in regional economic development policy analysis. A key aspect is discussion of features required for CGE models to become more useful in small-area economic policy analysis.

AB  - At present, environmental issues associated with rapid economic development are becoming critical concerns that arouse government's and people's particular attention. A large amount of influencing factors and especially their complicated interactions have always thrown confused insights into assessing the dynamic evolvement and sustainable development of urban economy-resource- environment (ERE) system and programming the developing strategies. A combination of system dynamics (SD) and geographic information system (GIS) is expected to explicitly understand the synergic interaction and feedback among a variety of influencing factors in time and space, since SD model can extend the spatial analysis functions of GIS to realize both dynamic simulation and trend prediction of an ERE system development. According to connotation and framework of sustainable development, this study proposes a dynamic combination method of SD-GIS to model and evaluate the urban development in Chongqing city of China suffering from depletion of resource and degradation of environment. To compare different policy inclinations with regard to potential ERE effects, typical scenarios (current, resource, technology and environment scenarios) are designed by adjusting the parameters in the model and changing the specification of some variables. Integrated assessment results indicate that the current ERE system of Chongqing is not sustainable; environment scenario is more effective to sustainable development of urban ERE system in a long run. Under the considerations of development features and regional differences, as well as regular discipline on urbanization, a coordinated combination of environmental, resource and technology scenarios is anticipated to realize sustainable development of urban ERE system. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To address the pressing challenge of effectively managing multinational corporations' (MNCs) global sales forces, we offer a theoretical framework and investigate the effects, across cultures, of particular sales man- ager practices on sales manager effectiveness (SME). Further, we examine whether high SME is associated with salesperson commitment, regardless of national culture. The model is tested on survey responses from 888 salespeople from Canada, Mexico, the United States, China, Australia and New Zealand. The results reveal that national culture moderates most antecedents' relationships to SME. For example, masculinity weakens the positive effect of fixed compensation on SME, supporting the expectation that salespeople in highly masculine countries are more driven to achieve material rewards through greater variable pay. Collec- tively, study results suggest cultural conditions where managerial practices should be prioritized. SME has a universally positive effect on salesperson commitment, reinforcing the thesis that adapting sales manager practices across countries to optimize SME provides a tangible advantage.

AB  - There are manyadvantages of applying cellular automata (CA) models to urban systems: realism, spatiality, resolution, presentation, and links with geographic information systems. The CA lattice can be generalized to represent urban spatial structures, networks of accessibility, or the physical infrastructure of the city. Not surprisingly, CA and the patterns that they generate exhibit many idiosyncrasies of complex adaptive systems, such as phase shifts, power laws, self-organization, self-similarity, and fractal dimensions. Spatial relationships, such as topologies and networks, are crutial parts of a GIS database. Topology is employed to manage common boundaries between features, define and enforce data integrity rules, and support topological queries and navigation (for example, to determine feature adjacency and connectivity). Topology is also used to support sophisticated editing and to construct features from unconstructed geometry (for example, to construct polygons from lines). Networks describe a connected graph of GIS objects that can be traversed. This is important for modeling pathways and navigation for transportation, utilities, and many other network-based applications. Practically, CA and GIS have several generalities indeed. First link between CA models and GIS can be observed on an initial stage of the modeling: CA pattem and raster data are cell-based (pixels). Second one is spatial relationships that depends on local connections. Third and the most promising link is that integrating them we can get more information about urban system development. As an example, we take a small raster drawing from GIS, use it in our Urban CA Model (URBACAM) as a pattern, reach relevant proportions; make some simulations and analysis.

In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model.

AB  - The Praxitele project is responsible for the design of a new kind
of transportation in an urban environment, which consists of a fleet of
electric public cars. The realization of such a project requires
experimentations with the behaviour of autonomous vehicles in the urban
environment. It was necessary to design a virtual urban environment in
which simulations could be done. Reproducing the real traffic of a city
as completely as possible, implies the simulation of autonomous entities
like living beings. Such entities are able to perceive their
environment, to communicate with other creatures and to execute some
actions either on themselves or on their environment. Interactions
between an object and its environment are, most of the time, very
simple: sensors and actuators are reduced to minimal capabilities which
permit them only to avoid obstacles in a 2D or 3D world. This is due to
the fact that databases for virtual environments are often confined to
the geometric level, when they must also contain physical, topological
and semantic information. Accordingly, we propose a model which is
designed to connect different levels of representation, by assembling
geometric, topological and semantic data in the field of traffic
simulation, and its implementation in VUEMS, a Modelling System of Urban
Road Network. From real world data (when available), we construct a
model of the virtual urban environment, integrating all the information
needed to describe the realistic behaviour of car drivers and

Moreover, we adopt a algorithm of reduce the number of the wavelet basic function by analysis the sparseness property of sample data which can optimize the wavelet network in a large extent, and the learning algorithm based on the gradient descent was used to train network. We discussed and analyzed the effect factor of urban logistics demand. With the ability of strong nonlinear function approach and fast convergence rate of WNN, the modeling and forecasting method can truly forecast the logistics demand by learning the index information of affect logistics demand. The actual forecasting results show that this method is feasible and effective.

AB  - CITIES grow in a way that might be expected to resemble the growth of two-dimensional aggregates of particles, and this has led to recent attempts(1-3) to model urban growth using ideas from the statistical physics of clusters, In particular, the model of diffusion-limited aggregation(4,5) (DLA) has been invoked to rationalize the apparently fractal nature of urban morphologies(1). The DLA model predicts that there should exist only one large fractal cluster, which is almost perfectly screened from incoming 'development units' (representing, for example, people, capital or resources), so that almost all of the cluster growth takes place at the tips of the cluster's branches. Here we show that an alternative model, in which development units are correlated rather than being added to the cluster at random, is better able to reproduce the observed morphology of cities and the area distribution of sub-clusters ('towns') in an urban system, and can also describe urban growth dynamics, Our physical model, which corresponds to the correlated percolation model(6-8) in the presence of a density gradient(9), is motivated by the fact that in urban areas development attracts further development. The model offers the possibility of predicting the global properties (such as scaling behaviour) of urban morphologies.

AB  - Qualitative calculus of policy models is an appropriate method for policy impact analysis in the case of imprecise information concerning the structural model parameters. The conditions of the so-called sign-solvability analysis of a linear equation system--with information represented by a positive, negative, or zero impact--are strict, however. In this paper, the relevance of qualitative calculus for urban policy modelling is discussed. An extension of the sign-solvability approach (with purely qualitative information) will be dealt with in the case of a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. We introduce the use of matrix decomposition methods, of theoretically plausible parameter restrictions, and of a top-down/bottom-up approach for sign-solvability. The sign-solvability approach is applied to a dynamic policy simulation model of urban decline in The Netherlands, developed for the city of The Hague. Given the insufficiently reliable database for estimating the model in a conventional econometric way, qualitative calculus was used in order to infer conclusions regarding the direction of impacts of policy variables.

AB  - Classic paradigm of scientific modeling is mainly based on a set of previously, accepted or assumed theories about the target phenomena and a validation procedure by limited observations. Therefore, normally data has a supporting role in the modeling process. On the other hand, recent advances in computing technology have brought us a data deluge that may change the classic paradigm of scientific modeling. Information flows and data streams have reached a level of maturity that they can play the main role in modeling of the real systems, without relying on lots of assumptions and rules in the first step. This turn may cause an inversion in the concept of modeling as a rational process. The proposed theoretical idea in this work is that traditional theory-driven models have a theoretical limit in modeling complex systems, known as curse of dimensionality and further, to highlight the fact that massive urban data streams can open up a new data-driven modeling approach, which goes beyond simple data driven analytics or eye catching info-graphics toward operational models of complex phenomena. In this work we describe a conceptual framework for modeling city wide traffic dynamics that proposes a way to encapsulate the complexity based on abstraction power of Markov chains in a coexistence with continuous data streams. Therefore, finally as an experimental set up, we applied the proposed model to a real data set, consisting of GPS traces of taxi cabs in Beijing and the results have been explained.

AB  - Selecting an appropriate process modeling language forms an important task for organizations engaging in Business Process Management initiatives. A plethora of process modeling languages has been developed over the last decades, leading to a need for rigorous theory to assist in the evaluation and comparison of the capabilities of these languages. While substantial academic progress in the area of process modeling language evaluation has been made in at least two areas, using an ontology-based theory of representation or the framework of workflow patterns, it remains unclear how these frameworks relate to each other. We use a generic framework for language evaluation to establish similarities and differences between these acknowledged reference frameworks and discuss how and to what extent they corroborate each other. Our line of investigation follows the case of the popular BPMN modeling language, whose evaluation from the perspectives of representation theory and workflow patterns is comparatively assessed in this paper. We also show which tenets of modeling quality these Communications of the Association for Information Systems 2 frameworks address and that further research is needed, especially in the area of evaluating the pragmatic quality of modeling.

AB  - Abstract.  This article uses the results from formal network analysis to test hypotheses about the character of Russia's post-communist transition, taking decision-making elites at the sub-national level as the unit of analysis. From the transition literature, the hypothesis generated is that city politics retains elements of its pre-democratic structure; from the urban regime theory, the hypothesis generated is that the elites’ structure will show elements of convergence to a Western type, with the prominence of actors from the private sector. The data is drawn from a survey of elites in one city, Novosibirsk, undertaken in 1997. The results show that the membership and structure of the network has some similar characteristics to a Western city. Rather than being purely dominated by bureaucratic elites, the private sector plays a role. The private sector actors are grouped with the public sector actors, though they are not, however, equal partners to the networks as its members do not appear among the most networked in the city. We conclude that the legacy of the past may not be as much a constraint as the transition literature supposes.

We present an approach to automatically reconstruct buildings densely spanning a large urban area. Our method takes as input calibrated aerial images and available GIS meta-data. Our computational pipeline computes a per-building 2.5D volumetric reconstruction by exploiting photo-consistency where it is highly sampled amongst the aerial images. Our building surface graph cut method overcomes errors of occlusion, geometry, and calibration in order to stitch together aerial images and yield a visually coherent texture-mapped result. Our comparisons show similar quality to the manually modeled buildings of Google Earth, and show improvements over naive texture mapping and over space-carving methods. We have tested our algorithms with a 12 sq km area of Boston, MA (USA), using 4667 images (i.e., 280 GB of raw image data) and producing 1785 buildings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Selecting, locating, and managing trees to provide ecosystem services are becoming increasingly important facets of municipal and consulting forestry. The science of urban tree growth modeling is fundamental to quantifying these services. This paper describes three long-term tree growth studies conducted to evaluate tree performance because repeated measurements of the same trees produce critical data for growth model calibration and validation. Several empirical and process-based approaches to modeling tree growth are reviewed. Modeling is more advanced in the fields of forestry and pomology than in urban forestry. The USDA Forest Service's reference city research has developed over 1,800 growth equations from measurements on more than 17,000 trees in 16 cities. The database is a valuable source of information that reflects regional differences in species composition, climate, soils, site conditions, and management practices. Several examples illustrate how differences in local climate and management practices can influence growth of a single species and the resulting value of services. Further advances in urban tree growth modeling are needed to inform the design, management, and modeling of high performing landscapes. © 2012 International Society of Arboriculture.

The influence of the export and service concept is found to be pervasive. With the changing context for urban analysis, the major issues appear to have shifted from that of how to accommodate growth through land allocation process. Among the higher priority issues are concerns with equity and environmental quality, the increasing complexity in client-sponsor relations, the need for better policies for operations as well as investments, and the design of meaningful information systems. To complement the other papers in this special issue, suggestions are made to modify or augment urban dynamics by the use of subjective probabilities; the use of empirical feedback to reduce uncertainties and imperfection of knowledge in urban system behavior; the inclusion of explicit values in the construction of a diversity of urban models used together in a gaming process; and the consideration of projecting structural changes in the urban model as a function of changes in values, institutions, and technology.

Traditional image-based modeling methods often cannot model such large areas due to error accumulation and limited camera field of view. Our approach widens the camera field of view by constructing a 360 degree panorama from ground-level images and uses a high resolution orthorectified aerial image to provide the building footprints. Users draw the building outlines in the aerial image and select a point as the approximate ground camera location. The method automatically extracts roof corners in the ground images and registers the panorama to the aerial image according to geometric constraints. The height of each building is calculated from an estimated camera pose. The resulting textured model of the buildings is constructed of planar surfaces.

AB  - Geographic information processing and visualization on new types of platform such as mobile environment or web environment has been regarded as one of industrial and academic issues. For this, the various approaches for mobile GIS and Web GIS are being carried out on the application level. Motivation of this study is on system architecture and a prototype implementation for 3D mobile and Web 3D application. Platforms and devices for mobile 3D GIS technology manipulating geographic data and information provide some limitation to design and implement: limited CPU and memory, absence or limited performance of graphic accelerators, small size of display panel, and so on. Moreover, in the urban application, 3D spatial information is crucial for complex feature modeling. Core functions of mobile 3D GIS by feature-based approach was designed as some modules: data model and design of spatial features, editing and manipulating of 3D landscape objects, generating of geometrically complex type features, supporting of both database and file system, handling of attributes for 3D objects, texture mapping of complex types of 3D objects and digital elevation model with image library containing high resolution satellite imagery. With these functions, an integrated urban 3D modeling and rendering system was implemented using standard mobile 3D graphic API (application programming interface), OPENGL|ES (Open GL for embedded system), with MS EVC 4.0 MFC. As well as this mobile 3D design and implementation, multiple types of geographic features or objects encoded by GML (geography markup language) for the XML-databases building are taken into account of practical applicability for 3D urban approaches.

AB  - The paper explores a framework combining remote sensing and spatial metrics aimed at improving the analysis and modeling of urban growth and land use change. While remote sensing data have been used in urban modeling and analysis for some time, the proposed combination of remote sensing and spatial metrics for that purpose is quite novel. Starting with a review of recent developments in each of these fields, we show how the systematic, combined use of these tools can contribute an important new level of information to urban modeling and urban analysis in general. We claim that the proposed approach leads to an improved understanding and representation of urban dynamics and helps to develop alternative conceptions of urban spatial structure and change. The theoretical argument is then illustrated with actual examples from the urban area of Santa Barbara, California. Some questions for future research are finally put forward to help strengthen the potential of the proposed framework, especially regarding the further exploration of urban dynamics at different geographic scales.

AB  - A sustainability technology evaluation platform has been prototyped for simulating integrated technology systems within a specific urban regional context. “Sustainability technologies” refer to available and potentially available technologies that may help to decrease human pressures on the environment or natural resources while providing a desired standard of living. The platform is based on an Internet-based infrastructure for integrating distributed models, called DOME (distributed object-based modeling environment) that has been developed to provide a simulation environment in which large systems, such as an urban region, can be modeled. The infrastructure can support flexible and transparent integration of independently developed computational tools from a wide range of fields such as geographic information systems, input–output analysis, life cycle analysis, and technology process modeling. The tools are linked in a decentralized ad-hoc manner so that an integrated simulation can be developed as understanding of the system grows. Tools are available to observe and understand the emerging structure of the system simulation, and to evaluate and optimize the system based upon its behavior.The urban sustainability technology evaluation platform is built from three basic types of computational elements linked through DOME. These are elements that provide information defining the urban region, elements that simulate behavior of technologies to be evaluated, and elements that integrate and analyze the region-specific effects of the technologies. As an example of the first type, a GIS (geographic information system)-based land use object has been developed to provide information needed to drive simulation models for a wide variety of urban technologies. Examples of the second type include technology simulation models of photovoltaic solar cell modules (PV modules). An object that provides a generalized life-cycle assessment by calculating both the direct and indirect effects of a given technology on total production levels and total pollution emissions in a region using Leontief Input–Output analysis represents the third type of computational element. All of the objects support Internet-enabled GUI''s (graphic user interfaces) through the DOME infrastructure, allowing users to transparently connect to, interact with, and utilize object functionality or data.A system model is constructed from these elements to study the economic cost and effect on emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> associated with installing PV modules on the rooftops of buildings in Tokyo, Japan. The development of this technology evaluation simulation illustrates the use of the three types of objects and how, by using the DOME infrastructure, they may be linked to form system models to evaluate sustainability technologies.

As part of this effort, we developed a new version of the SLEUTH model (SLEUTH-3r), which introduces new functionality and fit metrics that substantially increase the performance and applicability of the model. In addition, we developed methods that expand the capability of SLEUTH to incorporate economic, cultural and policy information, opening up new avenues for the integration of SLEUTH with other land-change models. SLEUTH-3r is also more computationally efficient (by a factor of 5) and uses less memory (reduced 65%) than the original software. With the new version of SLEUTH, we were able to achieve high accuracies at both the aggregate level of 15 sub-regional modeling units and at finer scales. We present forecasts to 2030 of urban development under a current trends scenario across the entire Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, and three alternative scenarios for a sub-region within the Chesapeake Bay watershed to illustrate the new ability of SLEUTH-3r to generate forecasts across a broad range of conditions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the empirical analysis of the convergence processes we consider the effects of interactions among neighbouring regions implementing spatial econometrics techniques. We conclude that both the EU-15 and the new member states (NMS) experienced absolute regional income convergence during the EU pre-enlargement period. When national effects were included into convergence equations, there was no evidence for conditional convergence neither between EU-15 nor NMS regions. The results of the analysis indicate that EU regional policy should focus on overall cohesion by improving conditions for regional income convergence particularly within the member states.

In this paper, we describe an urban growth model, the Phoenix Urban Growth Model (PHX- UGM), illustrate a series of model calibration and evaluation methods, and present scenario-based simulation analyses of the future development patterns of the Phoenix metropolitan region. PHX-UGM is a spatially explicit urban landscape model and is a modified version of the Human-Induced Land Transformations (HILT) model originally developed for the San Francisco Bay Area. Using land use and other data collected for the Phoenix area, existing growth rules were selectively modified and new rules were added to help examine key ecological and social factors. We used multiple methods and a multi-scale approach for model calibration and evaluation. The results of the different evaluation methods showed that the model performed reasonably well at a certain range of spatial resolutions (120–480 m). When fine-scale data are available and when landscape structural details are desirable, the 120-m grain size should be used. However, at finer levels the noise and uncertainty in input data and the exponentially increased computational requirements would considerably reduce the usefulness and accuracy of the model. At the other extreme, model projections with too coarse a spatial resolution would be of little use at the local and regional scales. A series of scenario analyses suggest that the Metropolitan Phoenix area will soon be densely populated demographically and highly fragmented ecologically unless dramatic actions are to be taken soon to significantly slow down the population growth. Also, there will be an urban morphological threshold over which drastic changes in certain aspects of landscape pattern occur. Specifically, the scenarios indicate that, as large patches of open lands (including protected lands, parks and available desert lands) begin to break up, patch diversity declines due partly to the loss of agricultural lands, and the overall landscape shape complexity also decreases because of the predominance of urban lands. It seems that reaching such a threshold can be delayed, but not avoided, if the population in the Phoenix metropolitan region continues to grow. PHX-UGM can be used as a tool for exploring the outcome of different urban planning strategies, and the methods illustrated in this paper can be used for evaluating other urban models.

AB  - Where to get data for urban planning and management is one issue, but how to manage these data is still a challenging task. This article focuses on the technical issue of managing data. The core data for urban planning are land-use data, which, if updated frequently, raises the issue of structuring, storing, querying, and displaying the data. Modeling, querying, and displaying changes in land-use data have been a challenge for many designers and urban planners. We propose a novel approach to model land-use changes based on object-oriented concepts and a mathematical theory of cell complexes. For object-oriented concepts, the Unified Modeling Language is used. Each land use is considered as an object. This object is an instance of the SpatioTemporalAttributeClass, which is the aggregation of SpatialClass, TemporalClass, and AttributeClass. The AttributeClass is a metaclass of LanduseClass and EvidenceClass. This article focuses on the AttributeClass (land use). The two types of land uses considered here are detailed and general land use. Detailed land use is recorded at the parcel level, while general land use does not require parcel information. Parcel-level land use is indispensable for many operational and strategic planning exercises. An object-relational approach is employed to achieve the model at the logical level. This approach may help alleviate the accessibility problem of land-use data in an urban environment. Through Structured Query Language, it is demonstrated how the spatiotemporal queries can be made.

AB  - In this paper, we present a modeling framework for complex networks, which is called Dynamic Graph Hybrid System (DGHS for short). First, we give a descriptive definition of DGHS. Furthermore, as a typical motivational example of DGHS, we apply it to model urban traffic signal control (UTSC) network, and the UTSC network model we propose is in fact a development of the well-known cell transmission model (CTM) in traffic flow theory. In addition, the problem of combination of vertices of UTSC network is considered.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology for generating semi-automated 3D models of urban area from multiple high- resolution satellite images. Adoption of Rational Function Models (RFM's) during recent years as a replacement for satellite's rigorous sensor model by many commercial imagery providers makes 3D information extraction fast and reliable for most of end-users. This paper presents an application of RFM in generating 3D terrain models, i.e. bear-ground models void of any vegetation and man-made objects, as well as 3D surface modeling (surface models with man-made objects). A fast one- dimensional terrain-dependent object-based search technique for identifying correspondences in multiple images followed by a refined 2D search to obtain an optimal correspondence match is introduced. Corresponding objects are then used in conjunction with the RFM to generate 3D model of the area. Example of correspondence matching and a 3D model generated for a selected area of Yokohama, Japan using QuickBird stereo images is presented.

AB  - This paper describes a type of project that images a city as it might exist given the integration of hemostatic procedures within pedestrian networks during emergencies requiring full-scale egress from an urban core. It articulates the steps taken to integrate a pre-existing C++ hemostasis model (C. Jacob, 2008) into Maya software in order to describe how the project operates on a computational level. By projecting these agent-based logics directly into/onto each pedestrian in the city (the smallest unit of the system), egress-oriented infrastructure can shift from being extensively predetermined in form (concrete barriers, metal railing, police barricades, etc.), to something more intensively defined, real-time, and locally on-demand. These procedures are situated within a larger schema based on the structural principles of Norbert Wiener's cybernetic feedback loops, that acknowledge and allow for hybrid (top-down + bottom-up) awareness and control within systems. The project attempts to ally itself with emerging forms of network design with similar structural typologies supported through the use of personal mobile devices (PMDs) in urban environments.

AB  - A 3D reconstruction of an urban area for Virtual Worlds (VWs) or Serious Games (SGs) requires a careful trade-off among the 3D models' realism, weight and development time. This has led us to the definition of an algorithm – the Architectonic Style Area (ASA) algorithm – for procedural generation of buildings in an urban area, based on the concept of “architectonic likelihood”, that intends to give players the sense of being in a particular city or even specific area of a city. This has a cognitive foundation in the fact that, after a visit, a tourist typically does not remember every single palace of a city, but remembers – beside the most important monuments and buildings – its general features and its architectonic styles. The algorithm extrudes 2D maps and composes façades by statistically assembling sample images of architectonic components from the target city. Components are classified in an ontology based on the classic principles of architecture. The algorithm relies on rules that encode the semantics of the ontology. The paper describes the algorithm and the related easy-to-use visual authoring tool. It also shows the results in two different projects: a SG for the promotion of the cultural heritage and a 3D movie. Results show that the approach allows keeping the realism of every single building at good detail and of the overall scene, while dropping a huge work of image collection and processing for the textures. Comparisons are investigated with regard to state of the art urban modeling methods, highlighting the differences and possible synergies.
