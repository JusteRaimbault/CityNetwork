AB  - In recent years, Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) have been widely implemented to prevent from suspicious threat. Unlike traditional Intrusion Detection System, IPS has additional features to secure computer network system. The additional features identifying and recognizing suspicious threat trigger alarm, event notification, through responsible response. However, IPS has issues problem, which affect the utilized overall system. In this paper we present the main challenging problem and steps to avoid that, such as (i) accuracy signature, (ii) the traffic volume, (iii) topology design, (iv) quota usage logging, (v) protecting intrusion prevention system, (vii) monitoring sensor, and (viii) collaboration of UTM. Finally, as part of our enhancements, we explored the possibility of making framework to collaborate and integrated various technologies of defense system, we called Unified Threat Management (UTM).

AB  - This paper proposes the application of a novel voltage stability index computation scheme to microgrid (MG) interconnected power systems. The L-index provides an online mechanism for computing and rating the status of the interconnected system into the utility-supplied, pre-microgrid, microgrid-supplied and island operational modes for improved operation. It may also provide a triggering signal to control the point of common coupling (PCC) converter to reduce network voltage violations in situations where the MG system has the capability to inject reactive power to the grid during periods of emergency or peak loads. Simulation results obtained with IEEE 14 bus system with MG later connected to load bus twelve as a PCC to the microgrid system, showed the suitability of the developed model towards providing smooth operation under both normal and distressed conditions.

AB  - The phenomenon of globalization has renewed interest in thinking about the place & role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (& their residents) has become increasingly tied to their position in international flows of investment & trade. While some have suggested the appropriateness of network techniques for the study of the global urban system, few have effectively realized their application. Utilizing data on the branch locations of the world's 500 largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 1981 & 2000, we employ network analytic techniques to examine change in the structure of the world city system. First, we evaluate the more than 3000 cities that are knit together in the MNE-generated city system in terms of three measures of point centrality (viz., degree, betweenness, & closeness) at both time points. Second, we use these measures to answer a series of questions regarding the development of the world city system: (1) How extensively has the structure of the world city system been altered across the era of globalization? (2) Have power & prestige in the world city system grown more concentrated? (3) Have cities been decoupled from "traditional" political geography in the course of globalization? In answering these questions, we trace out the changing structure of the world city system & address key concerns in the literature regarding its evolution.

AB  - The real world is a three-dimensional (3D) space requiring that 3D geospatial information applications be developed in alignment with the observer's visual and perceptive habits. Particularly, 3D building model data are required in a wide range of areas such as urban planning, environmental protection, real estate management and emergency response. At the same time, the development of Web service technologies allows the possibility of the widely distributed 3D geospatial data on the web. 3D city building model with its related information is an important part in the construction of a digital city system, and has become a staple resource on the web nowadays. In view of the hierarchical representation of a 3D building model, an abstract of a 3D building model based on structure details is studied, and a novel representation approach named 3D transparent building hierarchical model is presented in this paper. This approach fully uses both the existing 3D modeling technologies and CAD constructing mapping data. By the spatial relationship description, structural components inside a building can be represented and integrated as hierarchical models in a unified 3D space. In addition, based on the characteristics of the 3D building model data, a service-oriented architecture and Web service technologies for 3D city building models are discussed. The aim of the approach is that 3D city building models can be used as a kind of data resource service on the web, and can also exist independently in various different web applications.

AB  - Services and agencies continue to deploy IP SATCOM systems while awaiting migration to the joint IP modem (JIPM). As the JIPM nears production, challenges such as establishing responsibility for development of a common end user terminal, satellite and hub resource allocation and management, and long term sustainment for the end-to-end SATCOM infrastructure must be addressed. Currently, the DoD gateway hosts numerous IP SATCOM systems including Linkway, iDirect, and DVB-RCS. All of the SATCOM systems are responsible for providing defense information systems network (DISN) connectivity and services to the warfighter. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) aims to establish commonality and interoperability among the current capabilities. To achieve this end state, DISA is evaluating the establishment of a DISN satellite service (DSS) provided as an extension of existing IP SATCOM systems, DISN transport, and RF services embedded at the DOD gateways. As part of the DISN satellite service, DISA is designing a ubiquitous IP SATCOM suite capable of providing DISN connectivity and access to all of the DISN services including VTC, VoIP, NIPR, and SIPR. This paper will further elaborate the proposed DSS end user terminal components and capabilities and the advantages it provides to the deployed warfighter.

The model allows, for the first time, easy investigation of both Er-Yb doped amplifiers and high-concentration EDFAs where the upconversion process plays a fundamental role. In addition, we calculate and show the transfer function that relates output signal dynamic to amplifier perturbation arising not only from channel add/drop, but also from pump power fluctuation. This allows optimum electronic circuit design and implementation of electronic feedback. The impact on a metro system of next-generation components, such as waveguide amplifiers, is reported.

AB  - The paper argues that systems analysis provides an invaluable frame for many aspects of urban studies. Two uses of the systems approach are identified. First, there is the use of the approach to conceptualize the phenomenon of study such that the researcher's emphasis is on the nature of the interrelationships of the objects and the attributes of the system of interest on the one hand, and the study of subsystems of interest within an interacting whole, on the other. Secondly, there is the use of the systems approach to generate appropriate methodological tools for the analysis and description of urban spatial and functional structure. For these uses of the system approach, the concept of entropy, introduced from both thermodynamics and information theory, plays a significant role. Empirically, the concept is used to generate interaction patterns of the journey to work subsystem in Jos, Benue Plateau State, Nigeria, while certain indices of information theory entropy are used to unravel the nature and structure of these flows or movements of people. It emerges that the concept of entropy can be used in studies of urban spatial structure as an integrating concept provided that our terms are defined explicitly and unambiguously. Â© 1976.

AB  - Characterization of rainfall variation in time and space is an indispensable part of crop monitoring for food security in Africa. In order to compensate for sparse and late- reporting rain gauge stations, early warning systems often rely upon indirect estimates of precipitation. Examples are estimates derived from satellite imagery and output fields from numerical models of the atmosphere. In order to support workshop discussions, rapid and limited comparisons of two such data sets were made against available station data for a region of western Kenya. Substantially better agreement with station data was observed for the satellite rainfall estimates than was the case with atmospheric model reanalysis fields. Though limited in scope, we believe the results are indicative of the relative performance of these two classes of indirect rainfall estimators.

While many scholars suggest that the broader parameters of the world system structure the urban hierarchy embedded within or articulated to it, others argue that the urban hierarchy is decoupling from the world system. The analyses show that there has been some modest convergence in the distribution of power in the world city system. Moreover, they suggest that the mechanism for this convergence is the upward mobility of cities located in the semi-periphery and the east Asian region. The paper closes by considering the implication of these findings for a larger understanding of the relationship between globalisation, the structure of the world city system and its articulation with the world system.

In this paper, I\nargue that institutional factors have played key roles in shaping\nChina's city system, which is characterized by declining population\nconcentration across cities and by tremendous vertical (population\ngrowth of cities) and horizontal (addition of new cities) expansions.\nThe empirical analysis focuses on describing the size distribution of\ncities, estimating a multivariate model predicting the population growth\nof cities, and performing a logistic regression analysis of new and\nexisting cities. The findings underscore the effects of urban and\nregional development policies, socialist institutions, changes in the\nurban administrative system, and state and local government interests,\nand suggest that they as a whole are more important than economic\nfactors in explaining the attributes and changes of China's city system.

by Petri nets is equivalent to the determination of firing sequences of

on the immune system response mechanism, which differs substantially
from conventional enumerative methods. The firing sequence problem is
reformulated by decomposing it into several smaller sub-problems, the
model itself is divided into several sub-models and local firing
sequences that will compose the original model firing sequence are
selected by interacting common transitions of these sub-models, through
local objective functions. Local objective functions are set dynamically
by internal and inter sub-problems interactions, based on the immune

AB  - Literacy is examined from the viewpoint of systemic linguistics. It is proposed that "literacy" means intervening in the social processes by working with written language, and this can not be accomplished by an individual alone. "Using written language" can not be isolated from "using language." While sociologically, it may make sense to treat literacy as a thing in itself, linguistically, it does not. Writing may have its own grammar, discourse semantics, and genres, but everyone who writes, speaks; and the primary context of writing is speaking. All ideologies in literate cultures are the product of both; not the sum of the two, but the dialectic between them. At this level, it makes little sense to treat literacy and oracy separately; the concept needed is that of "articulacy," or making meaning by using text in context.

The most common heat exchanger network layout associated with the boiler is a completely parallel design, where the duty of each cold process stream is met by an external hot utility stream. This observation suggests that the flow rate of steam needed for the system can be reduced, while maintaining the required duty, simply by introducing series connections to the layout of the network (Kim, J.

Phase change of saturated steam to saturated liquid plays a vital role in the targeting method as well as the design of the network layout, since the saturated liquid (and resulting reuse liquid) is also used to meet the cold process duty requirements. A hybrid graphical and mathematical technique for targeting and network synthesis is presented. The main objective of the technique is to reduce steam flow rate without compromising the duty requirements of the process heat exchangers. In order to assess the advantage of a hybrid technique, a case study is used where a steam savings of 29.6% is obtained, compaired with using just saturated steam.

methods, incremental load flow approach (ILFA) and marginal transmission
loss approach (MTLA), have been developed to determine a generator's
share of transmission loss in a fully deregulated power system. ILFA is
very simple and employs the load flow technique in an iterative way.
MTLA is basically a mathematical modeling of the transmission losses
based on Kron's loss formula in a fully deregulated network. It
calculates marginal increase in transmission loss due to an increase in
load. These methods along with some numerical results have been

The important issues in this stage are to determine the restoration sequence of target nodes, and to optimize the restoration paths for the node restoration sequence. Both of the two issues are considered as a whole in this paper. Some electrical indexes, such as line operating time, line operating costs, and cranking unit number, are introduced to reflect the electrical characteristics of power system network. At the same time, based on the topological characteristics of power system network, a topological index, node importance degree is introduced here to solve the optimization problem. Meanwhile, the classic Dijkstra algorithm and the genetic algorithm are employed to search the global optimal restoration sequence of target nodes and node restoration paths. The numerical tests on the IEEE 30 system validates the strategy proposed in this paper.

The power system network consists of high voltage (HV), medium voltage (MV) and low voltage busbar (LV). Monitoring equipment in the power systems network are installed at strategic and appropriate 33/11 kV feeder. The propagation and the travelling of voltage sag from one busbar to another busbar can't be recorded in each part of the power system network. This paper has been written to investigate the propagation of voltage sag from one busbar to the other busbar through transformer connections due to power system faults. Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD/EMTDC) will be used to construct and simulate a power system model network. The results of this work later will be used to develop an empirical rule for the propagation of voltage sag in power system network. It is hoped that the empirical rule can be used for an example planning for voltage sag mitigation in the power system networks and monitoring purposes.

AB  - The research constitutes the first effort to test the claim found in the world city theoretical literature that, as world cities strengthen ties with each other, their linkages with their countries' hinterlands and national urban systems will weaken. This research offers a more nuanced exploration of this hypothesis by taking into account variation in the nature of the state across countries in which world cities are located as well as the source of global capital in the world cities. Specifically, the research reported here suggests that three types of world cities-market-centred bourgeois world cities (MWC), state-centred political bureaucratic world cities (SWC) and dual-role world cities (DWC)-entail different deterritorialisation outcomes. Three countries that have prototypical global cities-Japan (SWC), China (DWC) and the US (MWC) are compared, applying longitudinal network modelling to relational data on national city networks. From 1993 to 2007, more globally connected MWCs weakened their national ties. In contrast, higher global status has no significant effect on the integration of SWCs or DWCs with their national urban systems. This indicates that the type of state, but not the source of capital, conditions whether the world city will deterritorialise vis-A-vis its national city system.

The growth of the city system exhibits four stages that are evident from our quantitative analysis of the convergence of population in large cities and qualitative analysis of historical socioeconomic and technological developments. The decadal city size distributions in the aggregate evolve with a persistent pattern while individual cities over time shift positions in the urban hierarchy as the result of adapting or passing growth opportunities in infrastructure innovations, economic change, and industrial transformations. These decadal city size distributions exhibit persistent discontinuities that mainly occur in the upper and lower tails. The observed patterns and discontinuities are indicative of the stability and resilience of a complex adaptive system of cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

conditions can be achieved by co-ordinated control of switchable shunt
VAr compensating (SVC) devices and on-load transformer taps (OLTC),
while generator excitations are used in the dynamic control of voltage
profile. This paper deals with the development of an expert system for
voltage corrections for base case and contingency conditions using
switchable shunt reactive compensation and transformer tap settings. The
performance of the expert system is compared with the conventional
optimization technique of voltage control and concurrent results have
been obtained. The proposed expert system has been tested with simulated
conditions of a few practical power systems. Results obtained for a 24
bus EHV Indian power network have been included for illustration
purpose. The expert system is found to be suitable for online
application in energy control centers as the solution is obtained very
quickly

AB  - In a deregulated electrical power system network, every
transaction of electricity between a generator and a customer involves
some loss. In some cases, a generator while supplying its load however,
may, actually decrease the transmission loss by opposing an initial
flow. This flow is commonly termed as counter-flow. An algorithm has
been developed to trace counter-flow in a deregulated power system
network and calculate transmission loss share of each generator
considering counter-flow. Two methods, namely the incremental load flow
approach (ILFA) and marginal transmission loss approach (MTLA) are
utilized to determine allocation of transmission losses

AB  - Tele-care system has been regarded as one of important industry in the future. This study tends to integrate many functions in long-distance care system through the Web services. For instance, integrating wireless measuring instruments and information systems helps patients in hospitals or at home to have access to complete care. When patients rest at home or do activities outside, measuring instruments may monitor their basic physiological status through the wireless transmission equipment. If an exception occurs, measuring instruments may issue a warning signal to remind, or inform the relatives and friends and even health care centers through Internet automatically in order to save time. Moreover, when patients have to get in hospitals or process online interview, doctors may use the daily recorders to identify or discuss. This study uses physiological monitoring chips to measure status; now the chip can measure body temperatures, respirations and ECG physiological information. The final studies have shown questions of the hidden nodes, exposed nodes and access points. To simulate the experiment, this experiment used NS2 (Network Simulator Version 2) simulation software. As a result, the performance of network service nodes will be affected by the mode of nodes-operation.

It is now clear, however, that self and microbial HSPs also play an important role in the control of the immune response. Here, we focus on HSP60 and its interactions with both the innate and adaptive immune system in mammals. We also consider that circulating HSP60 and the quantities and specificities of serum antibodies to HSP60 provide a biomarker to monitor the immune status of the individual. Thus, the dual role of HSP60 as an immune modulator and a biomarker, provides an opportunity to modulate immunity for therapeutic purposes, and to monitor the immune response in health and disease. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Symmetry in antibody plus complement mediated killing between a T15 idiotype-bearing monoclonal antibody (HPC-M2) and an anti-T15 monoclonal antibody (B36-82) is demonstrated. The HPC-M2 antibody is also shown to be multispecific in its effector function, since it lyses both phosphorylcholine coated erythrocytes, and B36-82 Fab coated red blood cells. The symmetry and multispecificity in effector function are presented as new evidence against the concept that the paratope of antibody molecule exists as a uniquely defined site on the antibody variable region. A theoretical consequence for immune system network theory is that the anti-idiotypic set and the internal image are functionally equivalent, the results support symmetric network models of regulation, and are evidence against asymmetric models.

AB  - On-line power system analysis enables to make power mode-related decision based on information available at real time. The quality of the studies and efficiency of power system operation are closely associated with the accuracy of the power system models. Accurate and quick decision based on analysis on real time data has been necessary for making operational plan under the deregulation of power system world wide. In addition there has been phenomenal expansion of power system in India in recent times especially after introduction of Electricity Act 2003, introduction of open access and emergence of power markets through power exchanges have brought complexities in power system operation and control. Power network analysis on real time data is expected to further enhance the critical role in grid operation after proposed regulations for fixing the transmission tariff and loss apportionment. All these have necessitated power system analysis on real time conditions very accurate but based on diverse principle. In order to meet all requirements ranging from monitoring, commercial, reliability and stability angle, an attempt has been made to adopt hybrid nature of network model in real time supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system which has till date works on an integrated single network model. In this paper it is proposed for a theoretical basis of network modeling and the same is adapted in southern regional load despatch center (SRLDC) Bangalore India and analysis using energy management system (EMS) tools for the real time system. It has been shown how a systematic planning can make on-line network modeling and analysis relatively simple under complex operational requirement. Experimental results show that adaptation of on-line power management strategies can be a key tool in the hands of control engineers in the complex power system operation scenario.

In this paper, Multi Agent Controller (MAC) has been proposed to maintain the system operational criterions such as the maintenance of voltage and other parameters. This has been implemented in two area network to demonstrate the application of MAC where it maintains the continuity of power in the area subjected to fault. MAC is implemented by using an open source agent building toolkit Java Agent Development framework (JADE). Simulation is carried out in Mat lab environment. Macsimjx has been used to interface the simulink model with Multi Agent System (MAS). Detailed simulation has been carried out during various fault conditions. The results demonstrate the continuity of power supply to the critical loads through Distributed Energy Resource (DER) even in absence of Grid power.

AB  - Distributed Generation (DG) is growing rapidly in power systems due to their potential solution for issues, like the deregulation in power system, to meet the power demand and the shortage of transmission capacities. Optimal placement of DG assumes significance that improper allocation of DG sources in power system would not only lead to increased power or energy losses, but can also jeopardize the system operation. Also optimal placement of DG is necessary for the maximization of reliability and stability in power system. In this paper classical grid search algorithm based on successive load flows has been employed to obtain optimal location and size of multiple DG units in radial power system network in order to minimize total active power losses and to improve voltage profile of the system. The proposed method is the extension of single DG placement to the placement of multiple DG units. It is significant because of the fact that with the integration of DG units at various locations, there is more reduction in total power losses and maximum voltage drop in the system is also decreased. The proposed method is tested on 12-bus radial distribution feeder with different sizes of DG source. The obtained results are presented in graphical manner

In this paper we present a (customizable) tool, able to compute in real-time the most important connectivity properties of a network, modeled as an undirected graph: connected and biconnected components, articulation points and bridges. The algorithm underlying the tool has been theoretically analyzed in the (semi-)streaming model, and has been tested with graphs up to hundreds of millions nodes and billions edges. The tool, therefore, can be employed to monitor traffic flows in medium and large networks, at real-time, and detect possible anomalies.

The model is based on a sophisticated mover-stayer formulation of inter-city population migration, upon which is included the classical SIS dynamics of disease transmission which operates within each city. Our analysis studies the stability properties of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) of the full n-city system in terms of the reproductive number R(0). Should vaccination reduce R(0) below unity, the disease will be eradicated in all n-cities. We determine the precise conditions for which this occurs, and show that disease eradication by vaccination depend on the transportation structure of the migration network in a very direct manner. Several concrete examples are presented and discussed, and some counter-intuitive results found.

AB  - For the past 20 years, researches using the lens of world system theory (and other global political economy perspectives) have come to a better understanding of many of the anomalies in urbanisation patterns across more and less developed countries that had befuddled researchers whose assumptions left out global sources of social change. Recently this line of research has moved beyond regarding cities as mere objects of global forces, also theorising about their importance as lynchpins in the spatial organisation of the world economy. In this paper we review some of the scholarship that emphasises large citiesâ roles as important modes of production, consumption, exchange and control at the global level; we develop the argument that systematic linkages - economic, cultural, political or social-relational - among global cities are likely to reveal the spatial organisation of the world-system; we review our position that formal network analysis provides a most promising methodological framework for analysing and mapping global intercity linkages; and we present a map of the current world city system based on our network analysis of recent air travel among many of the worldâs great cities. We point out that our analysis is very preliminary and provides only a rough chart of the world city system at one point in time, and the data requirements for more detailed world city system maps for several periods of time are imposing, to say the least. Nevertheless, such a project holds the promise of revealing much about the spatial structure of our world system, how it has changed; how it is likely to change in the future; and how citiesâ populations are affected by these changes. Completing the project will probably require collaboration among researchers in different countries.

We relate each locationâs urban chances to its physical, first nature, geography characteristics, and develop a novel empirical strategy to assess how the existing urban system surrounding each location (second nature geography) determines its urban prospects. First nature geography is the dominant determinant of city location until the sixteenth century. Second nature geography becomes important from the seventeenth century onwards, in a way that corresponds closely to predictions from new economic geography theory.

The system was tested with records not used for training and performance was compared with radiologist. The network was 72% accurate in classifying clusters of calcifications as malignant or benign over a set of test cases radiologists had considered "hard-to-diagnose calcifications," and referred for biopsy. The radiologists had decided to conduct biopsy by selecting an equal number of positive and negative cases for the test group; thus the radiologists' performance with respect to categories of benign versus malignant was constrained to be 50/50. Statistical analysis shows only a 2% probability that the observed accuracy of 72% was a chance performance in recognizing whether a cluster is benign or malignant. The feasibility of developing a network of OAs for diagnosing breast cancer integrating digital image processing of mammograms is promising.

AB  - With an ever increasing amount of information being transmitted electronically, it is important that security be considered in every phase of local area network design and maintenance. Although much emphasis has been placed on such things as wireless networks and remote access, it is imperative that the core local area network not be overlooked. Because the wired local area network is the nervous system of an organizationâs Information Systems, great care must be taken to properly secure it. This chapter begins by looking at the implications for the wired local area network infrastructure security. Next, local area network segmentation and traffic isolation will be discussed. By using segmentation and isolation, there is the increased opportunity for security boundaries. Another concept that will be discussed is the security of the local area network equipment. The local area network is only functional if the core equipment is operational, so securing equipment is an important part of any security strategy. To conclude, restriction of local area network access will be investigated and an organizational approach will be discussed. Because more and more users need access to local area network resources, there must be a way to identify and restrict who is allowed on the network and what access they are granted. In wired local area network infrastructure security, organizations must remember they are only as secure as their weakest point. By carefully considering the various aspects of the local area network security during design, these weak points can be reduced and the overall security of the network increased. Although it is impossible to be 100% secure and still be functional, by using some general guidelines to secure the wired local area network, many threats to the network can be reduced if not eliminated.

Furthermore, a general criterion to map functionalities to system and network models is presented. As a case study, the proposed methodology is applied to the design of a Voice-over-IP client.

AB  - A communications link can only be considered successful when the
desired information is delivered to a user of the communications
service. In these days of overwhelming digital information broadcast via
numerous wide-area networks including the Internet and corporate
intranets, the ability of an individual user to obtain relevant, needed
information is becoming increasingly difficult. Information filtering
systems perform a data extraction function, analyzing an incoming stream
of information and selecting information that matches the needs of its
users. Inclusion of an information filtering mechanism in the
communications system ensures that the desired information is delivered
to a user. Currently, information filtering systems are based on
proprietary implementations that are not easily moved to other
platforms, do not readily scale for larger volumes of information, and
cannot be easily modified to handle new forms of data. This paper
presents an overview of the work we have done using the relational
database model to implement an information filtering system. We describe
the prototype information filtering system we have developed and its
initial system accuracy and performance measurements. Use of the

In real time environments, system configuration is dynamic. Breakers may operate at any time producing some of the following effects: 1) circuits may or may not be disconnected, 2) substations may or may not separate possibly forming new nodes, thus varying the total number of nodes in a system, and 3) an interconnected system may split into several separated areas. Unless provisions are made to automatically incorporate in real time the effects of breaker operations on system topology, any calculation and decision based on a wrong configuration would be dangerous, especially when most needed: immediately after the occurrence of the abnormality ity which lead to breaker operations.

AB  - Globalization has renewed interest in the place and role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (and their residents) has become increasingly tied to their po- sition in international ï¬ows of investment and trade. Data on the branch locations of the worlds 500 largest multinational enterprises in 2000 are subjected to two broad types of network analytic tech- niques in order to analyze the world city system. First, 3,692 cities are analyzed in terms of three measures of point centrality. Second, blockmodeling techniques are employed to generalize further about the positions and roles played by cities in the system. These tech- niques are used to trace out the structure of the world city system, locate cities in the context of a global urban hierarchy, and explore the degree to which this diverges from a simple one-to-one matching of cities onto nation-states in the world system.

AB  -  A system platform for location-based entertainment applications of mobile phones is described. With GPS and electronic compasses, some of today's mobile phones have rich functions for such entertainment as role playing games, treasure hunting, sightseeing with virtual information, etc. Our system model can manage virtual worlds that can be overlaid onto the real world with regard to location (latitude and longitude). Each virtual world is a set of virtual architectural objects and virtual creatures. Virtual creatures are active objects that can interact with users. In this paper, browser-based and BREW-based systems for virtual worlds are described. BREW is an efficient software platform for mobile phones. It enables autonomous location sensing and automatic redrawing, which will solve most of the problems found in evaluation sessions of the browser-based version.

AB  - The deterministic and restricted nature of industrial control system networks sets them apart from more open networks, such as local area networks in office environments. This improves the usability of network security, monitoring approaches that would be less feasible in more open environments. One of such approaches is machine learning based anomaly detection. Without proper customization for the special requirements of the industrial control system network environment, many existing anomaly or misuse detection systems will perform sub-optimally. A machine learning based approach could reduce the amount of manual customization required for different industrial control system networks. In this paper we analyze a possible set of features to be used in a machine learning based anomaly detection system in the real world industrial control system network environment under investigation. The network under investigation is represented by architectural drawing and results derived from network trace analysis. The network trace is captured from a live running industrial process control network and includes both control data and the data flowing between the control network and the office network. We limit the investigation to the IP traffic in the traces.

Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types: agglomerative and divisive. In this paper we shall introduce a new optimal selection method based on the well-known Max-Flow Min-Cut theorem, which also works for the hierarchically structure with overlapping. A novel dynamic algorithm was presented for the special structure without overlapping.

AB  - This article formulates a transit network design model for determining frequencies of each transit line in a network. This transit network design model requires a mode-split assignment model with distinct transit lines, each with its own specified frequency, to capture the mode split effects of increases or decreases in individual transit line frequencies. It is shown how to refine conventional mode-split assignment models to include this feature. The resulting model includes more precise measures of transit access and transfer delays, so that it more accurately predicts mode choices and link flows. This variation of the mode-split assignment model uses Dial's transit loader to solve Frank-Wolfe subproblems, using frequencies of individual transit lines to find fastest transit paths, considering access time, ride time, and any transfer delays. Computational shortcuts using the standard Hooke-Jeeves algorithm are demonstrated.

AB  - We propose a network management system which is suitable to disaster situation in U-city environment. U-city is a smart city with the intelligent convergence system that integrates IT technology and urban engineering technology such as environment, road traffic, safe and GIS. The network used in U-city should provide services without transmission failure and support functionality which enlarges the role of sensors used to collect information. Thus, a network management system which manages user's information is necessary. SNMP is the most widely used management protocol standard on the internet. But it manages a network has a static topology and the number of devices which are managed is small. To overcome SNMP problems, we propose an ubiquitous network management system (uNMS) that mobile devices in it is suitable in mobile network which go in and out U-city frequently and can manage lots of agents. And uNMS minimizes a usage of bandwidth. As shown in simulation results overheads are decreased about 40% and the connectivity is increased about 14%. When the mobility of mobile agents increases, the connectivity is 30% higher than SNMP.

AB  -  This work proposes a methodology and a practical tool for the study of long-term network planning under uncertainties. In this approach the major external uncertainties during the planning horizon are modeled as macroscenarios at different future time instants. On the other hand, the random nature of actual operating conditions is taken into account by using a probabilistic model of microscenarios based on past statistics. Massive Monte-Carlo simulations are used to generate and simulate a large number of scenarios and store the detailed results in a relational database. Data mining techniques are then applied to extract information from the database so as to rank scenarios and network reinforcements according to different criteria.

AB  - Harmonic and interharmonic distortion has become a main concern in electric distribution systems. Different types of harmonic and interharmonic sources exist in power system e.g. thyristor bridges, arc furnaces, cycloconverters and saturable magnetic devices. High harmonic voltages can be problematic to various sensitive equipments. Various harmonic surveys are conducted by various utilities and R&amp;amp;D organizations across the world to identify the level of harmonic distortion. National and international standards are implemented in various countries to limit the harmonic distortion. Interharmonics can be found in networks of all voltage classes and can cause temperature rise and torques in induction motors and flicker in lighting equipment. The problem with various available standards is that they are not treating the problem of interharmonics. No significant work on survey of interharmonics present in power system network has been reported. In this paper a summary of results of survey of interharmonics conducted in Indian power system network is presented. Interharmonic survey is conducted at 0.415 KV, 11 KV, 33KV, 132 KV and 220 KV networks feeding power to various categories of customers. The aim of the work is to identify the level of inter-harmonics in the various supply system feeding power to various categories of customers. The measurement and analysis is performed by using advanced power quality analyzer. According to the voltage and current inter-harmonic levels present in various supply systems , the effects of inter-harmonics on the system and solutions are discussed. Result of this survey will help to understand the existing level of interharmonic in voltage and current and need to address interharmonic issue in harmonic standards.

AB  - China's urbanization has accelerated during the era of reform. While there has been real progress in urbanization, the process has also been skewed by several administrative measures designed to foster urbanization and economic growth. According to a popular view, as many as 70 per cent of China's administrative jurisdictions now come under the rule of urban governments. This must be an exaggeration given that many parts of China are still essentially rural. This article examines three measures - turning prefectures into cities (di gai shi), turning counties into cities (xian gai shi), and turning cities and counties into urban districts (xian shi gai qu) - that have contributed to "inflated urbanization." Five propositions budgetary, urbanization, regulatory, organizational streamlining and policy incentive - are discussed to see if the three measures have either originated from or have affected them. We find that while the regulatory observation is relevant only for the measure of xian shi gai qu, the other four propositions are useful, though to varying degrees, for understanding the logic of the changing "city system" in the past two decades.

AB  - In this paper, we developed a power system normal operation application by multi-agent approach. The multi-agent system consists of several facilitator agents, equipment agents, and switch-box agents. A facilitator agent acts as a manager for negotiation process between agents. An equipment agent corresponds to the element of the electric power system, such as bus, transformer, and transmission line, while switch-box agent is the pseudo object which consists of neighboring current breakers and disconnecting switches. The proposed approach is applied to a simple network and a practical-size network, and the results show that the proposed multi-agent system approach is an efficient decentralized approach for solving power system normal operations

AB  - Electric power system network planning is influenced by the uncertainty in many parameters, such as future customer-demand/fossil-fuel-price parameter projections and new generation plant locations, which can generally be modeled in an approximate or subjective manner at best. Historically recorded wind power data presented here supports the contention that medium-term wind power generation profiles tend to follow more stable probability distributions. While it is widely acknowledged that the addition of wind power to a system makes network investment analysis more difficult in some respects, such data patterns nevertheless evoke an important discussion on how this relatively more probabilistic (i.e. not uncertain) characteristic of wind power may have some positive value for transmission planning and its related decision making procedures.
