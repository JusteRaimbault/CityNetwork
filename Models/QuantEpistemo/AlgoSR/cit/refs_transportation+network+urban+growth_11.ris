AB  - Agent-based urban traffic simulation has been looked as an efficient tool for traffic planning. However, the main problem is how to build an agent-based model for traffic simulation. This research presents an urban traffic information intelligent control model, which adopts a multi-agents coordination approach for urban traffic information control to coordinate the traffic network. In this paper, we propose a new traffic information intelligent control hybrid model based on multi-agent system that performs the basic interface, planning and supports services for managing different types of demand responsive transportation. In this research, we expose the main features and the behaviors exhibited of the multi-agent system. Based on this model, a simplified multi-agent traffic information control system can be developed that is effective for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.

AB  - This paper addresses an issue of short-term traffic flow prediction in urban traffic networks with traffic signals in intersections. An effective spatial prediction approach is proposed based on a macroscopic urban traffic network model. In contrast with other time series based or spatio-temporal correlation methods, this research focuses on the substantial mechanism of vehicles transmission on road segments and the spatial model of the entire urban network. Furthermore, this approach employs a simple speed-density model based on the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) to obtain a more accurate vehicle travel time on the link. Finally, the microscopic traffic simulation software, CORSIM, is adopted to simulate the real urban traffic, and the proposed method is used to predict the traffic flows generated by CORSIM. The simulation results illustrate that our approach performs effective prediction timely in the rush hours, as well as the suddenly changed traffic states. 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Traffic assignment is a procedure for estimating the distribution of traffic over a transportation system under specified conditions. This paper outlines work currently being undertaken at the Univeristy of York, aimed at the development of an extremely fast and smooth dynamic assignment method. The new method is based on natural route-swapping rules, with drivers swapping from more to less expensive routes as day succeeds day. The method is designed so as to be well-suited to implementation on parallel computing machines and also so that control strategies naturally fit the detailed framework. The aim is to utilise a parallel implementation of a natural route-swapping process so as to produce an extremely fast and accurate dynamic assignment tool which is able to design and assess control or pricing strategies on large networks. -from Authors

AB  - This research aims at developing a real-time simulation-based dynamic traffic model for mixed traffic flow conditions for ATMS/ATIS applications. The real-time model is implemented based on rolling horizon approach. The rolling horizon is advanced for each stage, thus real-time data can be incorporated within the framework. In order to predict normative as well as predictive information, a simulation-based DTA model is employed within each stage. Empirical data for freeways, including flows from toll stations and vehicle detectors, are used to validate the model in a real-time environment.

AB  - As an example of integrating signal control with network traffic assignment, the notion of path-based signal coordination in transportation networks is introduced and illustrated. The use of a real-time dynamic traffic assignment system allows prediction of the traffic flow patterns and identification of the dominant paths in the network. The signalized intersections along these paths, which may consist of combinations of straight sections and turning movements, are coordinated to increase the capacity of the freeway and the surface street system to efficiently absorb diverted traffic from the freeway. A set of experiments is designed to compare the network performance under the path-based coordination scheme with no coordination and arterial-based coordination. The experiments are conducted for both pretimed and vehicle-actuated signal control. An actual network, which represents the south-central part of the Fort Worth area, is used in these experiments. The network consists of a freeway (I-35W) surrounded by a street network with a total of 178 nodes and 441 arcs. The path-based coordination scheme is shown to outperform arterial-based coordination in the cases of both pretimed fixed control and vehicle-actuated signal control. A significant reduction in the network average travel time under the path-based coordination scheme is observed compared with the other schemes. This application further illustrates the benefits of real-time dynamic traffic assignment for advanced traffic management under incident conditions.

AB  -  In the paper a model of the traffic in the LAN is presented. In the model the most important components influencing the network traffic are taken into account. Namely, the transmission protocols and information buffering, operational systems and queuing algorithms as well as users' behavior working with the network applications are considered. The model is based on an "on-off" function. The network traffic observed at the physical layer is a superposition of many sequential and self-similar "on-off" processes. It has been shown that self-similarity of the traffic measured by Hurst parameter changing from almost 1.0 for very low frequencies to 0.5 for high frequencies. Implications, which arc derived from the model, are described in the conclusion.

AB  - This paper puts forward an alternative method which deals with the simulation and estimation of urban traffic network. The method is based on Cell Transmission Model (CTM), a macroscopic model for freeway traffic modeling. Some modifications on basic CTM are made to meet the requirement of urban traffic modeling. In order to test the performance of this model, a small virtual traffic network is set up and its simulation results are compared with those of Paramics', a microscopic simulator implemented under similar conditions. Furthermore, a much larger virtual network based on real metropolitan traffic system is constructed and investigated, using which we test the propagation of congestion. We reach the conclusion that our macroscopic model has the potential to depict the general evolution of urban traffic system, and simulate the propagation of congestion within complicated traffic network.

AB  - Skeletal muscle tissue is made up of highly organized multinuclear cells. The internal organization of the muscle cell is dictated by the necessary regular arrangement of repeated units within the protein myofibrils that mediate muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle cells have the usual membrane traffic pathways for partitioning newly synthesized proteins, internalizing cell surface receptors for hormones and nutrients, and mediating membrane repair. However, in muscle, these pathways must be further specialized to deal with targeting to and organizing muscle-specific membrane structures, satisfying the unique metabolic requirements of muscle and meeting the high demand for membrane repair in a tissue that is constantly under mechanical stress. Specialized membrane traffic pathways in muscle also play a role in the formation of muscle through fusion of myoblast membranes and the development of internal muscle-specific membrane structures during myogenesis and regeneration. It has recently become apparent that muscle-specific isoforms of proteins that are known to mediate ubiquitous membrane traffic pathways, as well as novel muscle-specific proteins, are involved in tissue-specific aspects of muscle membrane traffic. Here we describe the specialized membrane structures of skeletal muscle, how these are developed, maintained and repaired by specialized and generic membrane traffic pathways, and how defects in these pathways result in muscle disease.

AB  - The concepts of transport mode energy consumption and road network capacity are explained in the paper, which are applied to forecast the minimum energy consumption in a Meg polis. A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

AB  - Although dynamic traffic control and traffic assignment are intimately connected in the framework of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), they have been developed independent of one another by most existing research. Conventional methods of signal timing optimization assume given traffic flow pattern, whereas traffic assignment is performed with the assumption of fixed signal timing. This study develops a bi-level programming formulation and heuristic solution approach (HSA) for dynamic traffic signal optimization in networks with time-dependent demand and stochastic route choice. In the bi-level programming model, the upper level problem represents the decision-making behavior (signal control) of the system manager, while the user travel behavior is represented at the lower level. The HSA consists of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Cell Transmission Simulation (CTS) based Incremental Logit Assignment (ILA) procedure. GA is used to seek the upper level signal control variables. ILA is developed to find user optimal flow pattern at the lower level, and CTS is implemented to propagate traffic and collect real-time traffic information. The performance of the HSA is investigated in numerical applications in a sample network. These applications compare the efficiency and quality of the global optima achieved by Elitist GA and Micro GA. Furthermore, the impact of different frequencies of updating information and different population sizes of GA on system performance is analyzed.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

AB  - This study developed a dynamic traffic control formulation designated as dynamic intersection signal control optimization (DISCO). Traffic in DISCO is modeled after the cell-transmission model (CTM), which is a convergent numerical approximation to the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. It considers the entire fundamental diagram and captures traffic phenomena such as shockwaves and queue dynamics. As a dynamic approach, the formulation derives dynamic timing plans for time-variant traffic patterns. We solved DISCO based on a genetic algorithm (GA) approach and applied it to a traffic black spot in Hong Kong that is notorious for severe congestion. For performance comparisons, we also applied TRANSYT to the same scenarios. The Results showed that DISCO outperformed TRANSYT for all the scenarious tested especially in congested traffic. For the congested scenarios, DISCO could reduce delay by as much as 33% when compared with TRANSYT. Even for the uncongested scenarios, DISCO's delays could be smaller by as much as 23%. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  -  We consider a traffic network subject to known time-varying demands between its origins and destinations. We model the network as a discrete-time dynamical system driven by these demands. The state of the system at each time epoch is defined in a way that avoids complete microscopic detail by grouping vehicles into platoons irrespective of origin node and time of entry to network. Moreover, the formulation contains no path enumeration. The control variables correspond to the assignment or routing of the platoons on downstream links at the nodes of the network. Impedance functions combined with link outflow functions are used to model link travel times in the state transition function. This modeling approach allows for the study of the problem of dynamic traffic assignment in networks in the framework of the optimal control of dynamical systems. This work has applications to route guidance issues that arise in an Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems (IVHS) environment.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between âsupportingâ facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and ânewâ facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - In order to represent traffic assignment on a road network, we propose a new route choice model taking account of the imprecisions and the uncertainties lying in the dynamic choice process. This model makes possible a more accurate description of the process than those (deterministic or stochastic) used in the literature. We assume that drivers choose a path all the more than it is foreseen to have a lesser cost. The predicted cost for each path is modelled by a fuzzy subset which can represent imprecision on network knowledge (e.g. length of links) as well as uncertainty on traffic conditions (e.g. congested or uncongested network, incident â¦ ). The costs of all possible paths are compared and result in an attractiveness degree for each path. Various comparison indices can be used to represent the different possible natures of drivers when making their decisions (pessimistic/optimistic, risk-taking/risk-averting). The fuzzy choice model was compared with the LOGIT model (a widely used stochastic discrete choice model) and has been proved to be able to find the same results. The effect of Advanced Travellers Information Systems (ATIS) on drivers is modeled as a modification of the imprecision or the uncertainty of the predicted cost of a route.

AB  - Full article: A project to promote sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plants in the mountains of Chinaâs Upper Yangtze ecoregion has won the prestigious Equator Prize 2012.   The Equator Prize recognizes outstanding local initiatives working to advance sustainable development solutions for people, nature and resilient communities in countries receiving support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).   It is the second time the success of the project has been publicly acknowledged; in October 2011, the project received an âOutstanding Contribution Awardâ from the Chinese State Ministry of Environmental Protection, EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), Ministry of Commerce and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Over-harvesting of wild medicinal plant species is a serious conservation concernâaside from problems caused by the harvesting itself, the collectors can also have serious secondary impacts through camping within reserves, hunting and gathering fuel-wood to dry commercial quantities of medicinal plants. Such habitat destruction and disturbance also threatens endangered wildlife, including the Giant Panda Ailuropoda melanoleuca and the Takin Budorcas taxicolor.   The collection of medicinal plants in the Upper Yangtze is rising, with households compensating for loss of income from farming and timber logging due to the promulgation of two policies: a 1998 logging ban and a âGrain for Greenâ programme, introduced in 2000, which discourages farming on steep slopes.  To help alleviate matters, an initiative was developed through a comprehensive collaboration between WWF, IUCN and TRAFFIC as part of the EU-China Biodiversity Programme (ECBP), which led to local producer association members, harvesters and governmental officials receiving training in the implementation of organic wild crop harvesting practices and certification procedures, as well as application of the FairWild Standard principles.   âWe are delighted to see public recognition of the success of this initiative, which has demonstrated how sustainable harvesting of wild plant resources creates positive benefits for local livelihoods and conservation efforts,â said Anastasiya Timoshyna, TRAFFICâs Medicinal Plant Programme Leader.  Income for local producers in the project areas has increased, thanks to higher prices paid for certified sustainably harvested medicinal and aromatic plants. In the case of Schisandra berries Schisandra sphenanthera, international and local buyers paid at least 30% above normal market prices for certified produce. A survey of project sites in March 2011 found incomes from medicinal plant collection had risen, thanks to the certification schemes; in one village by almost 18% over 2007 levels.   The project also led to the establishment of links between producer associations and buyer groups: two communities have signed purchase agreements with a local winery and the newly established Shuijing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Cooperative has signed a 5-year fair trade agreement with a Californian company for supply of sustainably harvested Schisandra fruits.   In 2010, more than 5 tonnes (dry weight) of Schisandra fruits were sustainably harvested of which more than 3 tonnes were sold to Draco Natural Products (DNP Shanghai) for production of a concentrated dry extract specified by US-based Traditional Medicinals Inc (TMI). The project has scaled up from one village in the 2008 and 2009 harvests up to 22 villages in the 2011 harvest. From the autumn 2011 harvest, about 11.5 tonnes were shipped to DNP, enough to produce about 1.2 tonnes of certified organic dried extract for use in TMI products.   Further development of the project, supported through the Kangmei Institute of Community Development and Marketing has seen further adoption of sustainable harvesting methods in the region, and communities working through international partnerships to promote a âgiant panda friendlyâ brand and to create panda friendly certification standards for local harvesters.   âThis project is proving that local harvesters from villages surrounding the Giant Panda conservation area can successfully implement meaningful sustainability standards,â said Josef Brinckmann, VP of Sustainability for TMI.  âThe Schisandra harvesters are helping to protect the panda bear habitat from disturbance while working to conserve biodiversity and earning additional household income through an organic and fair price premium.  âTraditional Medicinals remains committed to a long-term equitable trade relationship with the 22 participating villages represented by the Shuijing TCM Cooperative.   âSchisandra is only the first success story.

AB  - According to some discoveries and analysis results of network measurement for network traffic in recent years, much literature has proven that traffic present the nonstationary Poisson characteristic at sub-second time scales in IP backbone, which not accord with self- similarity characteristic for last decade. By analyzing Internet structure, a novel weighted mapping model is put forward, which gives a reasonable explanation for the new traffic characteristic. The model relates chaos impact factors with traffic characteristic, and transfers the traffic with self-similarity in access network to that with Poisson characteristic. Finally, the validity of the model is verified by a lot of simulation experiments on NS2.

AB  - Tonoplast, the membrane delimiting plant vacuoles, regulates ion, water and nutrient movement between the cytosol and the vacuolar lumen through the activity of its membrane proteins. Correct traffic of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the tonoplast requires (i) approval by the ER quality control, (ii) motifs for exit from the ER and (iii) motifs that promote sorting to the tonoplast. Recent evidence suggests that this traffic follows different pathways that are protein-specific and could also reflect vacuole specialization for lytic or storage function. The routes can be distinguished based on their sensitivity to drugs such as brefeldin A and C834 as well as using mutant plants that are defective in adaptor proteins of vesicle coats, or dominant-negative mutants of Rab GTPases.

AB  - With the rapid population increase and the city's rapid growth in vehicle ownership, urban traffic congestion is becoming worse. The traffic security problem especially is important. This study focuses on urban traffic safety, which is based on analyzing the present situation and the causes of traffic congestion, from the perspective of sustainable transportation, combined with the urban traffic planning theory and traffic intelligent development trends, and puts forward the traffic safety measures. Car networking (Internet of cars) is one part of Internet of things, which is equipped with electronic sensor vehicles for terminals. It connects the vehicle static or dynamic information and the information network platform through the RFID and the wireless data communication technology. Thus, it forms the network that has the function of effective supervision and comprehensive service for all vehicles. This paper uses system analysis method to optimize the urban traffic structure, improve the urban residents of travel efficiency and relieve urban traffic congestion, which is of great significance to improve the urban traffic safety.

AB  - Secretory and endocytic traffic through the post-Golgi endomembrane system regulates the abundance of plasma-membrane proteins such as receptors, transporters and ion channels, modulating the ability of a cell to communicate with its neighbours and to adapt to a changing environment. The major post-Golgi compartments are numerous and appear to be similar to their counterparts in animals. However, endosomes are rather ill defined morphologically but seem to be involved in specific trafficking pathways. Many plasma-membrane proteins cycle constitutively via endosomal compartments. The trans-Golgi network (TGN) appears to be an early endosome where secretory and endocytic traffic meet. Endocytosed proteins that are to be degraded are targeted to the vacuole via the multivesiculate prevacuolar compartment (PVC) whereas cycling proteins pass through recycling endosomes. The trafficking machinery involves the same classes of proteins as in other eukaryotes. However, there are modifications that match the specifics of post-Golgi traffic in plants. Although plants lack epithelia, some plasma-membrane proteins are located on specific faces of the cell which reflects polarized traffic and influences the physiological performance of the tissue. Plants also differentiate highly polarized tip-growing cells in which post-Golgi traffic is adapted to very high rates of targeted exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling.

AB  - The dynamic network microsimulation framework DRACULA (Dynamic Route Assignment Combining User Learning and microsimulation) has been developedat the University of Leeds, UK since 1993. It was developed as a tool to investigate the dynamics between demand and supply interactions in road networks. The emphasis is therefore on the integrated microsimulation of individual trip makersâ decisions, travel experiences, and learning. This is represented through a microscopic dynamic traffic assignment model based on the explicit modelling of individualsâ day-to-day route and departure time choices and how their past experience and knowledge of the network influence their future choices. Coupled with that is a detailed within-day traffic microsimulation based on car-following and lane-changing rules. This chapterprovides an updated overview on the main functions of DRACULA model. The recent focus of our research on the issues of model calibration and validation is discussed. Some of the extended features of the software, on modelling the overtaking behaviour on two-lane rural roads and the fully integration with a microscopic model of public transport operations and demand, are represented.

It is shown that the effects of tariffs, urban wage subsidies and urban production subsidies in the short run, in which capital is immobile, do not carry over to the long run with capital mobility.  Policies for promoting urban growth reduce the urban unemployment ratio in the short run, but, by contrast, raise the urban unemployment ratio in the long run.  Along with agglomeration economies and inter-sectoral externality, the urban unemployment ratio plays a key role in determining social welfare.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - Accelerated population growth in general and an increasing expanse and intensity of metropolitan development through- out the world have focused attention on urban transportation and growth management. The high cost of urban highways and mass transit systems, coupled with the necessity of guiding private use of land toward acceptable levels of rational development, have resulted in various urban investment strategies. Among these, the concept of joint development of transportation facilities and high activity nodes has emerged as a promising solution to problems of overcrowding and congestion in major cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Such integrated public and private investment not only tends to maximize the cost effectiveness of required facilities, but offers opportunities benefit of the public at large and as an incentive for risk capital investment. A comprehensive study was undertaken by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning of Texas A&M University to examine the requisites of effective joint development in selected metropolitan areas, including Toronto and Montreal, Canada; Washington, DC, San Francisco and Atlanta in the USA; and Paris, France. In all instances, it was found that fixed guideway rapid transit had a discernible, positive impact on urban growth and intra-urban transportation, opportunities provided versely, it was confirmed that effective application of this strategy required the pre-existence of economic viability in general, and in the specific transportation for imaginative growth management and was, indeed, a major inducement for private investment.

AB  - Traffic simulation is an important tool for modelling the operations of dynamic traffic systems and helps analyse the causes and potential solutions of traffic problems such as congestion and traffic safety. Microscopic simulation models provide a detailed representation of the traffic process, which makes them most suitable for evaluation of complicated traffic facilities and Intelligent Transportation Systems that often consist of complex traffic management, safety and information systems. Macroscopic and mesoscopic models on the other hand, capture traffic dynamics in lesser detail, but are faster and easier to apply and calibrate than microscopic models. Therefore they are most suitable for modelling large networks, while microscopic models are usually applied to smaller areas. The objective of this thesis is to combine the strengths of both modelling approaches and diminish their individual weaknesses by constructing a hybrid mesoscopic-microscopic model that applies microscopic simulation to areas of specific interest, while simulating a surrounding network in lesser detail with a mesoscopic model. Earlier attempts at hybrid modelling have concentrated on integrating macroscopic and microscopic models and have proved difficult due to the large difference between the continuous-flow representation of traffic in macroscopic models and the detailed vehicle-and driver-behaviour represented in microscopic models. These problems are solved in this thesis by developing a mesoscopic vehicle-based and event-based model that avoids the (dis)aggregation problems of traffic flows at the inter-model boundaries. In addition, this thesis focuses on the general problems of consistency across the entire hybrid model. The requirements are identified that are important for a hybrid model to be consistent across the models at different levels of detail. These requirements vary from network and route-choice consistency to consistency of traffic dynamics across the boundaries of the micro- and mesoscopic submodels. An integration framework is proposed that satisfies these requirements. This integration

Crossroads are important part of urban traffic system, whose flow prediction on each direction is one of the most extraordinary key functions in the urban ITS. Some forecasting models have been developed, but these methods' precision usually can't meet with practical requirement. In this article, a neural network model is presented for forecasting crossroads traffic flow using backpropagation (BP) neural network. Through forecasting traffic flow at Hongqi crossroad in Ganzhou City, the result shows that this model has a considerable accuracy, which provides a new reliable and effective way of forecasting short term traffic flow of crossroads in urban road network.

In this paper, for the sake of improving the network efficiency, we present a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for urban traffic network based on hybrid systems, which formulates split control as an MPC problem. Theoretical results ensure convergence of iterations to a globally optimal solution. The framework is applied to the signaling split control of traffic network. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a comparative study on the ZhongGuanCun west region, Beijing was conducted using traffic simulation software. Findings indicate that the proposed control strategy is more efficient to reduce delay time and relieve traffic congestion of the whole traffic network when compared to the conventional fixed time control.

Importantly, we are frequently required to understand how traffic condition changes if we, for instance, construct a new route and/or alter traffic regulations. Especially, for a congested urban expressway network, we must estimate time-dependent changes of traffic to evaluate impacts of new policies and development of infrastructures. In developing the SOUND model, special attentions are paid so that it incorporates driversâ route choice behavior and controls traffic density as a function of the flow to simulate the shockwave propagation.

AB  - Traffic signals are very cost effective tools for urban traffic management in urban areas. The number of intersections in Sweden controlled by traffic signals has increased since the seventies, but efforts to study the traffic performance of the employed strategies are still lacking. The LHOVRA technique is the predominant isolated traffic signal control strategy in Sweden. Past-end green was originally incorporated as part of LHOVRA (the O function) and was intended to reduce the number of vehicles in the dilemma zone. Coordinated signal control in Sweden is often fixed-time with local vehicle actuated signal timing adjustments and bus priority. This research study was undertaken to increase the knowledge of the traffic performance impacts of these strategies. The aim was to evaluate the following control strategies using Stockholm as a case study: 1. The LHOVRA technique with a focus on the O function; 2. Fixed time coordination (FTC); 3. Fixed time coordination with local signal timing adjustment (FTC-LTA); 4. FTC-LTA as above + active bus priority (PRIBUSS); 5. Self-optimizing control (SPOT). Field measurements were used for study of driver behavior and traffic impacts as well as for collecting input data needs for simulation. The results from low speed approaches showed a higher proportion of stopped vehicles after receiving green extension. Moving the detectors closer to the stop line, and/or making the detectors speed dependent were suggested as measures to solve these problems. The VISSIM simulation model calibrated and validated with empirical data was used to study traffic performance and safety impacts of the LHOVRA technique as well as to test the suggested improvements. The simulation experiment results from these design changes were shown to reduce accident risk with little or no loss of traffic performance. TRANSYT was used to produce optimized fixed signal timings for coordinated intersections. HUTSIM simulations showed that local signal timing adjustment by means of past-end green was beneficial when applied to coordinated traffic signal control in the study area. Both delays and stops were reduced, although not for the main, critical intersection which operated close to capacity. To study the impacts of strategies for coordinated signal control with bus priority, extensive field data collection was undertaken during separate time periods with these strategies in the same area using mobile and stationary techniques. A method to calculate the approach delay was developed based on the observed number of queuing vehicles at the start and end of green. Compared to FTC-LTA, the study showed that PRIBUSS reduced bus travel time. SPOT reduced both bus and vehicle travel time. Future research efforts for the development of signal control strategies and their implementation in Sweden should be focused on strategies with self-optimization functionality.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - In order to achieve the goal of calibrating the capacity of road networks in a dynamic traffic model without requiring the 24h traffic flow data, this paper is intended to develop application-oriented models for traffic flow characteristic parameters of urban expressways based on physical properties. As the independent variables of the models, the physical characteristic parameters incorporating the ramp comprehensive index and the transit comprehensive index are proposed, and four traffic flow characteristic parameter models, including free-flow speed model, capacity model, speed-at-capacity model and jam density model, are developed using 160 sectional data from expressways in Beijing. It is found that ramps and harbor-shaped bus stops on expressways are main impact factors on free-flow speed, capacity and speed-at-capacity. The critical ramp-impact distance to free-flow speed is found 103m, and 3.5m is the inflection point of the relationship between the average lane width and the capacity. The proposed models are applied to the dynamic traffic model for the western 3rd ring-road expressway corridor in Beijing. It is shown that the proposed four models provide better input data to calibrating the capacity of the road network and improve the performance of the dynamic traffic modeling, especially when the road network is congested or unstable.

The two-fluid (the vehicles in traffic flow are divided into moving vehicles and stopped vehicles) model is able to describe the average operating performance of urban traffic, but it is difficult to collect individual vehicles data in the network for practical application of the model in urban area. The sampling strategies on data collection based on probe vehicles are stated in the paper and trip histories of probe vehicles are aggregated across link-based microtrip in order to estimate the model parameters. The algorithm of cost function is applied to map-matching with the help of GIS (Geographic Information System). The critical speed for identifying the vehicle state is determined through sensitivity analysis. The field experiments showed that the application of probe vehicle data is reliable to assess the network performance and traffic condition of urban street network.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

Therefore, network partitioning becomes an important task of such an urban traffic signal control system. However, urban traffic signal control network partitioning is a multiobjective and multiconstraint problem, which has been shown to be a NP-hard problem. This paper presents a partitioning method using the spectral methodology according to the correlation degree of each link. Two measures are adopted in this problem: modularity and average cut weight. The developed method has been tested on two networks, including a computer generated network and real world road network. The results show that the spectral bisection is a reasonable network partitioning method to support urban traffic signal control.

AB  - Moving bottlenecks in highway traffic are defined as a situation in which a slow-moving vehicle, be it a truck hauling heavy equipment or an oversized vehicle, or a long convey, disrupts the continuous flow of the general traffic. The effect of moving bottlenecks on traffic flow is an important factor in the evaluation of network performance. This effect, though, cannot be assessed properly by existing transportation tools, especially when the bottleneck travels relatively long distances in the network. This paper develops a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model that can evaluate the effects of moving bottlenecks on network performance in terms of both travel times and traveling paths. The model assumes that the characteristics of the moving bottleneck, such as traveling path, physical dimensions, and desired speed, are predefined and, therefore, suitable for planned conveys. The DTA model is based on a mesoscopic simulation network-loading procedure with unique features that allow assessing the special dynamic characteristics of a moving bottleneck. By permitting traffic density and speed to vary along a link, the simulation can capture the queue caused by the moving bottleneck while preserving the causality principles of traffic dynamics. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The DTA model iteratively reassigns flow to paths by using the method of successive averages on the basis of travel times obtained with a traffic simulation model. The original subnetwork extracted from a regional planning model was enriched by a great increase in the number of zones. The DTA origin-destination matrix was estimated from an extensive database of turning movement counts via a trip generation/distribution model and a matrix adjustment algorithm. The network topology was enhanced by the addition of an interchange and a more precise representation of arterial intersections, including traffic signal control plans. A set of 1-h turning counts was used to calibrate the DTA model by adjusting local parameters such as gap-acceptance values, as well as global parameters such as average vehicle length. The final model results were compared with an independent set of 15-min turning movement counts. The resulting R 2 values, which ranged from .91 to .96, lead to a high degree of confidence in the model results.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - It is well-known that big cities suffer from traffic congestion and all consequences that come with it. This is an especial problemin cities in developing countrieswhere the public transportation systemis not reliable andwhere the fleet of vehicles tend to be old thus increasing air pollution. There is no turnkey solu- tion for this problem, but several improvements have been suggested in the field of urban and traffic management, provided an information system is built which can provide information to both the traffic experts and the user of the system. Such an information system has to incorporate features of an ITS and an ATIS. An un- derline assumption is that there is a simulation model to provide certain kinds of information in forecast. This paper discusses the model and implementation of such an information systemwhich is based on a microscopic model of simulation and on cellular automata and is implemented using agent technologies and with a bottom-up philosophy in mind. We give here an overview of the project, the details of the modules (data, simulation, driver and information/visualization), as well as discuss an application of the simulation tool.

AB  - In this paper, a new multifractal traffic model to capture the multifractal nature of modern Internet traffic was developed. Employing the algorithm of network traffic analysis (binomial inverse cascade process) to analyze the multifractal feature of traffic data and adopting the algorithm of network traffic synthesis (binomial cascade process) to model the network traffic, this approach gave an easy and efficient way to infer the model parameters from the measured traffic traces. Moreover, the traffic was simulated and analyzed using obtained parameters. It was found that the simulated traffic data were in a close fit to the real trace statistics. The analysis results showed that this model could capture the real network traffic very well. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interactions between the cost of travel along a link and flow along other links and between the demand for travel along a route and flow along other routes are permitted.

AB  - Two continuous time formulations of the dynamic traffic assignment problem are considered, one that corresponds to system optimization and the other to a version of user optimization on a single mode network using optimal control theory. Pontryagin's necessary conditions are analyzed and given economic interpretations that correspond to intuitive notions regarding dynamic system optimized and dynamic user optimized traffic flow patterns. Notably, we offer the first dynamic generalization of Beckmann's equivalent optimization problem for static user optimized traffic assignment in the form of an optimal control problem. The analysis further establishes that a constraint qualification and convexity requirements for the Hamiltonian, which together ensure that the necessary conditions are also sufficient, are satisfied under commonly encountered regularity conditions.

AB  - We consider a dynamic traffic assignment model formulated as a nonlinear and noneonvex mathematical program. Necessary optimality conditions require equalization of certain marginal costs for all the paths that are being used, and these optimality conditions are shown to be a generalization of the optimality conditions of a conventional static traffic assignment problem. We also examine the behavior of the dynamic model under static demand conditions and show that in this case our model is a generalized version of a standard static model. Our model suggests a promising refinement of the objective function for the static case.

AB  - Time-lapse aerial photography over the Central Business Districts (CBD) of Austin and Dallas, Texas, has been employed to determine the averages of concentration, speed and fraction of vehicles stopped and to examine the relations among such network-wide averages including the flow which was measured on the ground simultaneously. The results have indicated that the average flow in a street network may indeed be expressed as the product of the space mean speed and concentration. Simultaneous ground experiments have also been conducted in the Austin CBD to investigate the reasonableness of the assumptions of the "two-fluid model," a curvilinear relation between the trip time and stop time per unit distance, which may be used in characterizing the quality of traffic service in urban street networks. As a result of these simultaneous ground experiments and aerial observations, the assumptions of the model have been verified. Moreover, relations between the fraction of vehicles stopped and concentration as well as between speed and concentration have allowed the two-fluid model to be used to compare the quality of traffic service in various street networks under the same level of concentration. The two-fluid model may then be used to predict, for a given change in vehicular concentration in a street network, the resulting changes in the averages of speed, fraction of vehicles stopped, flow, etc. This is particularly useful as a performance model in urban planning where for a given concentration it is desirable to predict the resulting traffic conditions.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - We describe a deterministic queueing assignment model which seeks to reduce total travel delays in a road traffic network by routeing drivers according to the total delay caused on each link (the local marginal delay). The model is approximate and is applicable to networks with many origin-destination pairs and many bottlenecks. Optimality of the solution determined by the model is discussed. It is particularly shown that, unlike in the steady state (Dafermos and Sparrow, 1969), reducing total travel times by using the local marginal delay will not generally result in an optimal solution. Results are provided for two networks.

AB  - In this paper, the combined dynamic traffic assignment and traffic signal control problems are discussed. After a brief retrospection to dynamic traffic assignment and traffic signal control is addressed, the conflict and interaction between dynamic traffic assignment and traffic signal control are analyzed. Then, the dynamic characteristic of traffic assignment and traffic signal control is considered and the theory of differential game is used to model. Dynamic traffic assignment and traffic signal control are formulated as a leader-follower differential game, in which a leader and multi-follower participate, under the open-loop information structure. Then, a leader-follower differential game model of dynamic traffic assignment and traffic signal control is proposed and the model is discreted and a simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve it. At last, a simulation is carried on a simple traffic network and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed differential game model.

AB  - Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an originâdestination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the originâdestination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - In order to alleviate urban traffic problems such as congestion, air pollution, and shortage of fuel, it is necessary to develop public traffic system with priority. A fundamental requirement for bus priority policy is to develop transit flow assignment models in the multimode network. Travelers' choice behaviors, e.g., mode and route choice, are important in modeling transit network flows. This paper develops a combined model for modal split and flow assignment in two modes network to obtain the proportion of traffic demand shared by bus and private car while considering the interactions between these two modes. And then a heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model. At last, a numerical example is used to illustrate the application of the model and algorithm. The results show that the traffic demand of private cars will increase quickly in the congested network for the lower service level of buses.

AB  - This paper presents a novel fuzzy model and a fuzzy logic controller for an isolated signalized intersection. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal waiting time and length of queue. Usually fuzzy traffic controllers are optimized to maximize traffic flows/minimize traffic waiting time under typical traffic conditions. Consequentially, these are not the optimal traffic controllers under exceptional traffic cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We apply state-space equations to formulate the average waiting time vehicles in traffic network at fixed time control. also, We propose a novel fuzzy model and new fuzzy traffic controller that can optimally control traffic flows under both normal and exceptional traffic conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller at novel fuzzy model is better that of conventional fuzzy traffic controllers under normal and abnormal traffic conditions.

AB  - The traffic assignment problem associated with a given transportation network is the process of distributing zone-to-zone trips on links of the network. A number of methods have been proposed to solve this problem, but none have been found to be entirely satisfactory. This paper is concerned with the nonlinear mathematical model of the problem, where the link-traveling costs are increasing functions of the link flows and no explicit capacity constraint is imposed on individual links. An efficient algorithm is developed, using a node-arc formulation of the problem. It is an adaptation of the convex-simplex method that takes advantage of the very special network structure of the traffic assignment problem formulated in this way. Numerical results obtained with a moderate size street network are presented.

AB  -  Faced with an ever-increasing economic loss due to traffic congestion and accidents, the Metropolitan Toronto Authorities investigated the posibility of improving conditions through the use of a general-purpose digital computer to optimize in real time and on line the operation of traffic control signals. Following the successful conclusion of a small-scale pilot project, approval was obtained for a completely integrated system designed to incorporate some 1000 signals distributed in complex network formation througbout an area of some 240 square miles. Converting the concept into reality required the design and installation of a considerable amount of specialized equipment, such as vehicle detectors, together with the development and preparation of complex computer programs including both control and analysis routines. With the initial stages of this work more or less complete, testing of various control philosophis commenced, starting with the least sophisticated and gradually working up, while continually studying actual traffic conditions so that levels of performance could be judged. After four years' effort, some 500 out of 850 existing signals are under computer control for an average of 15 hours every day, with the result that the time required to make any given journey has been reduced by an average of about 10 percent, even though the operational flexibility is still to some extent limited. A part from this major improvement, sufficient other benefits both direct and indirect have resulted from system operation to prove the validity of the original concept, especially on economic grounds. A conservative estimate indicates that, for a total capital outlay of some $5 million, wastage attributable to congestion and delay will be reduced by some $20 million per year.

AB  - Full article: New York, USA, 25th September 2012âPoaching and the illicit trafficking of wildlife products were raised on the floor of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time this Monday, during discussions on strengthening national and international governance. World leaders gathering in New York for the global bodyâs 67th annual meeting highlighted wildlife trafficking along with other severe threats to the rule of law such as corruption and drug running.  In a written statement, permanent Security Council member United States highlighted âthe harm caused by wildlife poaching and trafficking to conservation efforts, rule of law, governance and economic development.â The rapidly-growing illicit international trade in endangered species products, such as rhino horn, elephant ivory and tiger parts, is now estimated to be worth $5 billion per year globally.   âSuch organized crime is increasingly affecting the environment and biodiversity through poaching and illegal fishing,â Gabonâs President Ali Bongo said during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. âGabon intends to strengthen its criminal justice system to combat this phenomenon. But such efforts will require a greater international legal cooperation.â   Permanent member France also emphasized the severity and negative impacts of wildlife crime. âThere are still entire sectors of activity without any legal safety,â French Minister Delegate for Development Pascal Canfin said. âInternational law is lacking when it comes to the plundering of natural resources, for example, or the trafficking of fauna.â   President Bongo took the occasion to reaffirm his countryâs commitment to âcombating violations of the Convention on International Trade [in] Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora as well as other conventions to protect the environment and biodiversity.â  In response to record levels of elephant poaching in Africa, President Bongo oversaw the burning of Gabonâs seized ivory stockpile earlier this year after a full audit supported by WWF and TRAFFIC. Organized criminal syndicates, sometimes linked to armed insurgent groups, are believed to be behind many of the tens of thousands of elephant poaching deaths occurring in Africa each year. Ivory tusks are highly valuable on Asian black markets.   âIllicit wildlife trafficking can have severe consequences for people as well as the environment, yet it is not considered a serious crime by many governments. It is often a low risk and high profit criminal activity, which is a dangerous combination,â said Wendy Elliott, WWF Global Species Programme Manager. âGovernments have made a significant step forward by introducing the issue into this important forum on the rule of law. We now call on all them to increase their law enforcement responses to wildlife crime on a commensurate basis.â Roland Melisch, Director of TRAFFICâs Africa & Europe programmes said: âGood governance is essential to prevent crimes such as illicit wildlife trafficking. Countries need to be held accountable to their commitments under relevant United Nations treaties.â  WWF and its partner TRAFFIC, the wildlife monitoring network, are campaigning for greater protection of threatened species such as rhinos, tigers and elephants. In order to save endangered animals, source, transit and demand countries must all improve law enforcement, customs controls and judicial systems. WWF and TRAFFIC are also urging governments in consumer countries to undertake demand reduction efforts to curb the use of endangered species products.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - Driver's route choice has become a hot issue in the field of traffic research in the last years. However, most of the researches didn't pay attention to the relationship between the driver's route choice and the traffic control signal. Obviously, driver's dynamical route choice is notable affected by delay due to crossing signal control in his running course. On the other hand, the familiarities of the route can also affect driver's route choice. Basing on inquiries to drivers, driver's route choice behavior is studied. How driver makes choice among those routes with different familiarities influenced by urban traffic control system is analyzed. As a result of signal control strategy, orientation of driver's transferring from familiar route to unfamiliar one is discussed by using multinomial Logit Model. In the first part, this study introduces the necessity of the integration between traffic signal control system and navigation system. On the basis of building pertinent Logit Model and travel time estimation model, typical route choice model is presented then. At last, route familiarity, as a parameter of the model, is confirmed by processing test data. Investigation argues that driver's route choice can effectively described by Logit Model with variables of traffic signal split and route familiarity.

AB  - Full article: UK, 18th March 2013 - As part of the response to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) the UK government has announced it will not commit to long-term financial support for the National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) beyond 2013-14. This team plays a vital role in preventing wildlife crime here in the UK, and is also a contributor in the global fight against the illegal wildlife trade.  Commenting, Heather Sohl, species expert for WWF-UK said: "This is highly disappointing news, especially after the UK has fought hard towards an end to international wildlife trafficking at the CITES meeting over the last two weeks.[1] When the world is recognising illegal wildlife trade as a serious crime and looking for government commitments to end the trade, the UK should be stepping up its efforts to address these crimes within our own borders. The recommendations of the Committee are reasonable and would have achieved this, but the government is avoiding a long-term commitment to tackling wildlife crime."  The Government also rejected recommendations to tighten up the recording of wildlife crime data to help keep track and tackle trends in wildlife crime. Stephanie Pendry, Enforcement Programme Leader at TRAFFIC, who has worked as part of the unit, said: "I have witnessed first-hand the vital role that this unit plays. In the case of illegal wildlife trade, culprits are often part of wider criminal networks that operate across borders, and cracking down on such trade takes time and joint effort. It is precisely this time that the Unit have not been afforded by the Government, which is a real shame and will have a knock-on effect on operations to protect wildlife."  WWF and TRAFFIC gave evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) early last year and this was reflected in the October 2012 report on wildlife crime in the UK. It suggested that enforcement of wildlife crime in the UK is suffering due to the short term availability of funds, a lack of proper training and guidance over prosecutions, and unnecessarily complex legislation.[2]  UK prosecutors and judiciary must be aware of the serious nature of these crimes and how to handle them appropriately. Available penalties are not applied rigorously enough to reflect the nature of illegal wildlife trade crimes, so fail to act as a strong deterrent for future offences. Specialist wildlife crime training for generalist prosecutors and sentencing guidelines for the judiciary are needed.  The creation of specific wildlife crime codes have been rejected by the Home Office, but without the ability to record wildlife crime levels it is impossible to show the impact of such crime, and what trends are occurring, both over time and regionally. It is hard to justify more resources when it is not possible to demonstrate the true size and trends of the problem. If codes are not the answer, WWF and TRAFFIC urge the government to demonstrate an appropriate, alternative way to capture the information on crimes so desperately needed using existing systems.  Many of the EAC recommendations are also reflected in their inquiry from 2004.

AB  - Current network measurement systems are becoming highly sophisticated, producing huge amounts of convoluted measurement data and statistics. As a very common case, those networks implementing statistics reporting based on the NetFlow [15] technology can generate several GBs of data on a daily basis. In addition, these measurements are often very hard to interpret. In this chapter we describe a method that provides linguistic summaries of network traffic measurements as well as a procedure for finding hidden facts in the form of linguistic association rules. Thus, here we address an association rules mining problem. The method is suitable for summarization and analysis of network measurements at the flow level. As a first step, fuzzy linguistic summaries are applied to analyze and extract concise and human consistent summaries from NetFlow collections. Then, a procedure for mining hidden facts in network flow measurements in the form of fuzzy association rules is developed. The method is applied to a wide set of heterogeneous flow measurements, and is shown to be of practical application to network operation and traffic engineering [6, 5], where it can help solve a number of current issues.

AB  - This work presents two analytical models for the traffic signal control problem within dynamic traffic assignment framework. The bi-level formulation is based on a Stackelberg Duopoly game where the upper level objective is to determine optimal signal timing plans with the lower level representing a dynamic user equilibrium conditions. In addition, a single level system optimal model is proposed. Cell transmission model is adapted as the embedded traffic flow model in the form of a mathematical program. The single level program is solved and tested on a network containing multiple signalized intersections. It is found that the proposed model performs better than pre-timed signal timing plans.

AB  - Traffic congestion has become a stringent issue in urban areas. Traffic control systems are designed to make a better use of the existing traffic infrastructures in order to improve traffic conditions. Along with the fast development of the transportation infrastructures, traffic networks become larger and more complex. Therefore, network-wide traffic control systems that can coordinate the whole network and improve the utilization of the entire traffic infrastructure, are highly required. In this paper, a structured network-wide traffic controller is presented based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) theory. Two macroscopic models are proposed to be the prediction model of the MPC controller. One is more accurate, but correspondingly requires more computation time; the other sacrifices a certain amount of accuracy, but is computationally much more efficient. Based on these two models, MPC controllers are developed. Simulation results show that the MPC controllers are capable of coordinating an urban traffic network, especially in the situations that the traffic flow is not spread evenly through the network. Through reducing the prediction model, the corresponding MPC controller exhibits less on-line computational burden, and thus becomes more applicable in practice. Therefore, it becomes possible for the control system to deal with complex urban road networks more efficiently. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This research investigates the efficacy of using simulation in teaching the topic of transportation network growth through an experiment conducted at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota. In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, Hâ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - S-Paramics is a microsimulation modelling package that has been developed by SIAS in Scotland over a period of 20 years. It has been available commercially since 2000 and is used to model road traffic at a scale ranging from single junction analysis to wide area networks. S-Paramics simulates the intentions, decisions and subsequent actions of each driver in the road network as they move towards their destination. Each driver chooses their best route based on the basic network characteristics and their knowledge of the likely congestion they will encounter. As they move through the network, each driver prioritises a set of decisions over which lane to use, what speed to select, when to change lane and when to cross or merge with traffic in another lane. Calibration in S-Paramics is driven by correctly describing the network topology and the travel demand in it. For example, values such as saturation flows or lane use proportions are regarded as outputs from S-Paramics to examine the performance of the road network and may not be used as inputs to assist calibration. By modelling the cause of an action rather than prescribing the effect in the model, the predictive power of the simulation is preserved in subsequent changes to the model to test proposed road network changes.

AB  - Network user equilibrium or user optimum is an ideal state that can hardly be achieved in real traffic. More often than not, every day traffic tends to be in disequilibrium rather than equilibrium, thanks to uncertainties in demand and supply of the network. In this paper we propose a hybrid route choice model for studying non-equilibrium traffic. It combines pre-trip route choice and en-route route choice to solve dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) in large-scale networks. Travelers are divided into two groups, habitual travelers and adaptive travelers. Habitual travelers strictly follow their pre-trip routes which can be generated in the way that major links, such as freeways or major arterial streets, are favored over minor links, while taking into account historical traffic information. Adaptive travelers are responsive to real-time information and willing to explore new routes from time to time. We apply the hybrid route choice model in a synthetic medium-scale network and a large-scale real network to assess its effect on the flow patterns and network performances, and compare them with those obtained from Predictive User Equilibrium (PUE) DTA. The results show that PUE-DTA usually produces considerably less congestion and less frequent queue spillback than the hybrid route choice model. The ratio between habitual and adaptive travelers is crucial in determining realistic flow and queuing patterns. Consistent with previous studies, we found that, in non-PUE DTA, supplying a medium sized group (usually less than 50%) of travelers real-time information is more beneficial to network performance than supplying the majority of travelers with real-time information. Finally, some suggestions are given on how to calibrate the hybrid route choice model in practice to produce realistic results.

AB  - Route guidance and information systems are developed and popularly applied to help travelers to make route decisions today. Such devices can present information or give recommendations, so they have influence on the travelers travel choice in the traffic network. In this sense, the influence of guidance system on travelersâ route choice should be considered when the scenario of traffic network design is developed. However, few of existing traffic network design problem model considers the effect, and this motivates us to develop a Continuous Network Design (CNDP) model under a traffic network with guidance system. This study is based on the research of Jahn et al. (2005) to develop a single level program for CNDP under the traffic network with guidance system. The guidance system give advices to travelers based on system optimal rules with user constrains. From the result of simulation, it can be inferred that if the tolerance factor Ï is properly chosen in our CNDP model, travelers all can decrease their travel time after network design than that they experienced at user equilibrium before network enhancement. That is to say, every traveler can profit from our CNDP scenario for proper tolerance factor Ï.

The state of Oregon is entering its third decade of what many commentators describe as the nation's most aggressive urban growth management programme administered statewide. This article reports a recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the state urban growth management policies as they are implemented by the metropolitan Portland area. The metropolitan Portland area contains the largest population, employment and land base within a single urban growth boundary in the USA. Using primary data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the urban growth management and resource land preservation effort is assessed. Nearly all regional development has been directed to the urban growth boundary and away from resource lands. Many problems with administration are found, however. Policy implications are suggested.

The solution algorithm employs a FrankâWolfe method to identify the descent direction at each iteration, which requires the input of the derivatives information. A post-simulation sensitivity analysis is developed to estimate the derivatives in the TRANSYT traffic model. Good agreement of results with the values determined by numerical differentiation is obtained. Using these derivatives information, the FrankâWolfe method shows a good convergence behavior to the equilibrium solution. Comparison with other methods is also discussed in a numerical example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

We find a self-organizing collective behavior of such a model through simulation on a one-dimensional lattice model road: traffic congestion is greatly diffused when traffic signals have such autonomous adaptability with suitably tuned parameters. We also find that effectiveness of the system emerges through interactions between units and shows a threshold transition as a function of proportion of adaptive signals in the model.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The vertices of UTN are the road junctions or terminals and the edges are road segments.

AB  - This dissertation involves the development of three key components of the ATMIS: dynamic traffic assignment (DTA), surveillance, and management. Traffic volume (or queue) control scheme is widely used in traffic control practice and has been proven to be effective in managing congestion or gridlock. However, DTA considering the effects of traffic volume control schemes has been missing from literature. To fill this gap, this dissertation considers the analytical traffic volume (queue) control for traffic networks under two route choice behavior assumptions, i.e. dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) and dynamic system optimum (DSO). Existence of equilibrium to the DUE with traffic volume control is proven. The DSO analysis highlights the differences between the dynamic externalities of the two vertical queue models. The results are applied to investigate the traffic induced air pollution pricing. For the surveillance part, this thesis concentrates on the development of a macroscopic traffic flow model to capture traffic dynamics on networks influenced by demand and supply uncertainties. Based on the modified CTM and the switching mode model (SMM) a stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM) is proposed. The uncertain wavefronts are captured by probabilities of occurrence of operational modes which describe different congestion levels. The SCTM is calibrated and validated by several empirical studies. We compare the performance of the SCTM with Monte Carlo Simulation of the MCTM (MCS-MCTM). The results confirm that the SCTM outperforms the MCS-MCTM. We apply the SCTM to estimate the queues and delays at signalized intersections and compare the results with some well-known delay and queue estimation formulas. The comparison results show a good consistency between the SCTM and these formulas. In the traffic management part, optimal and robust decision making problems for managing uncertain network traffic are investigated. The traffic management problems are formulated as stochastic dynamic programming problems. A closed form of optimal control law is derived. The robust decision making problem, which aims to act robustly with respect to the supply uncertainty and to attenuate the effect of demand uncertainty, can be recognized as an equivalent optimal decision making problem. The applications of the proposed methods to incident management are also highlighted.

AB  - Our research work concerns the development of a multimodal urban traffic simulator designed to be a tool of decision-making aid similar to a game wherein the user-player can test different scenarios by immersion in a 3D virtual city. Our approach is based on the activity-based model and the multi-agent technology. The implemented result is a hybrid simulator connecting numerical simulation and behavioural aspects coming from real data. This paper is focused on two points: firstly, we introduce how a final user (the traffic regulator) instantiates and assembles components so as to model a city and its urban traffic network; secondly, we present the use of Dempster-Shafer theory in the context of discrete choice modelling. Our approach manipulates input variables in order to test realistic representations of behaviours of agent categories in a decision-making process. The traffic modelling is based on a questionnaire elaborated from standard arrays of Taguchi. The significant variables and interactions are determined with the analysis of variance which suggests a reduced model describing the behaviour of a particular social category. The belief theory is used to take into account the doubt of some respondents as well as for the preferences redistribution if the number of alternatives changes. The effects of external traffic conditions are also quantified to choose a 'robust' alternative and to use the agents' memory.

AB  - Urban traffic control systems evolved through three generations. The first generation of such systems has been based on historical traffic data. The second generation took advantage of detectors, which enabled the collection of real-time traffic data, in order to re-adjust and select traffic signalization programs. The third generation provides the ability to forecast traffic conditions, in order to have traffic signalization programs and strategies pre-computed and applied at the most appropriate time frame for the optimal control of the current traffic conditions. Nowadays, the fourth generation of traffic control systems is already under development, based among others on principles of artificial intelligence and having capabilities of on-time information provision, traffic forecasting and incident detection is being developed according to principles of large-scale integrated systems engineering. Although these systems are largely benefiting from the developments of various information technology and computer science sectors, it is obvious that their performance is always related to that of the underlying optimization and control methods. Until recently, static traffic assignment (route choice) modes were used in order to forecast future traffic flows, considering that the parameters which affect the network capacity are fixed over a given origin-destination matrix. Traffic engineering considers traffic flows as being constant and tries to optimize the control parameters in order to optimize certain parameters and measures of effectiveness. These two procedures, although largely depend on each other and known as the combined traffic assignment and control problem, are usually handled separately. The recent scientific and research developments in the fields of traffic assignment, with the rapid development of the advantageous Dynamic Traffic Assignment models, the new dynamic traffic control strategies and the evolution of ITS tend to modify the way with which networks are being modelled and their efficiency is measured. The current paper aims to present the major findings out of a critical review of existing scientific literature in the fields of dynamic traffic assignment and traffic control. Combined traffic assignment and traffic control models are discussed both in terms of the underlying mathematical formulations, as well as in terms of algorithmic solutions, in order to better evaluate their applicability in large scale networks. In addition, a generic and easily transferable scheme, in the form of a methodological framework for the Combined Dynamic Traffic Assignment and Urban Traffic Control problem is presented and applied on a realistic urban network, so as to provide numerical results and to highlight the applicability of such models in cases, which differ from the standard test networks of the related bibliography, which are usually of simple nature and form.

AB  - Traffic system is a complex adaptive system. Traffic assignment principle models route choice behaviour of the travelers. Efficiency and fairness are two important indexes for evaluating traffic assignment strategy. To date, disutility minimization behavioral rule has received most attention. User Equilibrium assumes that all the users are strictly selfish, they will strictly select minimum travel cost route. This assumption is not practical. In fact, when the driver selects the route, he will not consider whether his route to be selected is optimum. If travel cost is acceptable, he will select. The paper bases on boundedly rational notion and satisfying decision rule to formulate Boundedly Rational System Optimum model, in which the travelers will be assigned to the tolerable paths, and the objective function is to minimize the total travel time. Sensitivity analysis showed that Boundedly Rational System Optimum model can realize the integration of efficiency and fairness.

SNMP is simple but has limitations in terms of bandwidth overheads. High object identifier (OID) overhead, single request single response, no filtering capability are the typical limitations of SNMP which make the response time of a poll request high, especially over a low speed network. In this work, we propose a few extensions to SNMP to optimize the traffic and response time with minimal changes in the managed devices. From the implementation and experiments carried on corDECT networks, we show that there is considerable reduction in bandwidth requirements and response time for the management operations especially over dialup and low speed links.

AB  - A dynamic user-optimal link-based variational inequality assignment model in saturated urban traffic network is proposed. The flow is assigned to network accord the boundary-optimal principle. The flow propagation constraint, first-in-first-out constraint, link capacity constraint and the physical queue are considered. The link travel time experienced by vehicles in saturated network is dealt with two components: the uncongested cruise time over the link and the queuing delay. Finally, a discrete model and its nested diagonalization algorithm were given. An example was used to test the necessity and validity of the modeling.

AB  - SUMO is a microscopic road traffic simulation made available as open source under the GPL license. The complete suite includes tools for importing road networks, generating routes from different sources, and two versions of the traffic simulation itself, one started from the command line and one including a graphical user interface. The simulation uses the microscopic, space-continuous and time-discrete car-following model developed by S. KrauÃ and a lane-changing model developed within the work on the simulation. Traffic assignment is normally performed using the iterative approach formulated by C. Gawron, but further methods, such as a one-shot assignment method, exists. The traffic simulation offers a socket-based interface to external applications, allowing to interact with a running simulation online. Values and states of objects the simulation consists of can be both retrieved and changed. SUMO has been used within different projects both by the DLR and by external organizations. The software and documentation can be accessed at http://sumo.sf.net.

AB  - This paper deals with modelling of traffic networks (TNs) for control purposes. A modular framework based on coloured timed Petri nets (CTPNs) is proposed to model the dynamics of signalized TN systems: places represent link cells and crossing sections, tokens are vehicles and token colours represent the routing of the corresponding vehicle. In addition, ordinary timed Petri nets model the signal timing plans of the traffic lights controlling the area. The proposed modelling framework is applied to a real intersection located in Bari, Italy. A discrete event simulation of the controlled intersection validates the model and tests the signal timing plan obtained by an optimization strategy presented in the related literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Delivery of the glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) from an intracellular location to the cell surface in response to insulin represents a specialized form of membrane traffic, known to be impaired in the disease states of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Like all membrane trafficking events, this translocation of GLUT4 requires members of the SNARE family of proteins. Here, we discuss two SNARE complexes that have been implicated in insulin-regulated GLUT4 traffic: one regulating the final delivery of GLUT4 to the cell surface in response to insulin and the other controlling GLUT4's intracellular trafficking.

AB  - Recently, Daganzo introduced the cell transmission modelâa simple approach for modeling highway traffic flow consistent with the hydrodynamic model. In this paper, we use the cell transmission model to formulate the single destination System Optimum Dynamic Traffic Assignment (SO DTA) problem as a Linear Program (LP). We demonstrate that the model can obtain insights into the DTA problem, and we address various related issues, such as the concept of marginal travel time in a dynamic network and system optimum necessary and sufficient conditions. The model is limited to one destination and, although it can account for traffic realities as they are captured by the cell transmission model, it is not presented as an operational model for actual applications. The main objective of the paper is to demonstrate that the DTA problem can be modeled as an LP, which allows the vast existing literature on LP to be used to better understand and compute DTA.

AB  - The paper investigates a distributed control system scheme for urban road traffic management. The control algorithm is based on model predictive control (MPC) involving Jacobi iteration algorithm to solve constrained and nonlinear programming problem. The signal controllers of traffic network constitute a network of computers. They can distribute their computation realizing an efficient traffic control without any central management. However the optimal control inputs can be also calculated by a single traffic controller if the traffic network contains few intersections. The control aim is to relieve traffic congestion, reduce travel time and improve homogenous traffic flow in urban traffic area using distributed control architecture. The MPC based control strategy can be implemented in any urban transportation network but adequate measurement system and modern traffic controllers are needed. Theory, realization possibilities and simulation of the control method are also presented. The simulation results show that the system is able to ameliorate the network efficiency and reduce travel time. The distributed MPC based traffic control strategy proves the effectiveness by realizing a dependable control operation and creating optimal flow in the network subjected to control input constraints. &copy; Periodica Polytechnica 2010.

AB  - Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities growâtheir shape and sizeâwill have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growthâthat is, transportation routes, land use, and topographyâwere directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study siteâSt Louis, Missouriâto predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naÃ¯ve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naÃ¯ve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the modelsâ performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth.

AB  -  In this paper a new model for urban traffic control is presented. An urban area, composed of elementary components such as priority controlled intersections, simple road links, road links with on-ramps and off-ramps and intersections controlled by traffic lights, can be modelled as a discrete event system. In this work we use a modular and hybrid approach, where coloured timed Petri net models allow a microscopic representation for some parts of the network, while coarser, more aggregated models are used for other parts. One of the main aims in urban traffic control is to maximize the throughput of the system by means of real-time actions. One can, for example, maximize the network throughput by dynamically adapting the signal timings in response to changing traffic demand and by coordinating the operation of adjacent signals. The proposed hybrid model may be easily implemented in a simulation routine that is useful for state estimation and for model predictive control.

AB  - Many approaches had been proposed for travel time prediction in these decades; most of them focus on the predicting the travel time on freeway or simple arterial network. Travel time prediction for urban network in real time is hard to achieve for several reasons: complexity and path routing problem in urban network, unavailability of real-time sensor data, spatiotemporal data coverage problem, and lacking real-time events consideration. In this paper, we propose a knowledge based real-time travel time prediction model which contains real-time and historical travel time predictors to discover traffic patterns from the raw data of location based services by data mining technique and transform them to travel time prediction rules. Besides, dynamic weight combination of the two predictors by meta-rules is proposed to provide a real-time traffic event response mechanism to enhance the precision of the travel time prediction.

Aiming at reducing the saturation of arterial roads and microcirculation roads, the paper develops the bi-level programming model for optimizing one-way traffic organization with consideration of the maximum saturation restriction. The decision-making variable of the upper level programming is the scheme of one-way traffic organization of branch roads and the optimization targets are to minimize the average saturation of arterial roads and to minimize the excess of saturation over its maximum of arterial roads. The lower level programming is an equilibrium traffic assignment problem under the restrictions of the capacity of arterial roads and branch roads and the maximum saturation. The genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the model. The traffic conditions of arterial roads and microcirculation roads before and after optimizing of one-way traffic organization were compared by an example, which also proves the effectiveness of one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network. The proposed model provides an optimization method for one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network.

AB  - Driver's route choice has become a hot issue in the field of traffic research in the last years. However, most of the researches didn't pay attention to the relationship between the driver's route choice and the traffic control signal. Obviously, driver's dynamical route choice is notable affected by delay due to crossing signal control in his running course. On the other hand, the familiarities of the route can also affect driver's route choice. Basing on inquiries to drivers, driver's route choice behavior is studied. How driver makes choice among those routes with different familiarities influenced by urban traffic control system is analyzed. As a result of signal control strategy, orientation of driver's transferring from familiar route to unfamiliar one is discussed by using multinomial Logit Model. In the first part, this study introduces the necessity of the integration between traffic signal control system and navigation system. On the basis of building pertinent Logit Model and travel time estimation model, typical route choice model is presented then. At last, route familiarity, as a parameter of the model, is confirmed by processing test data. Investigation argues that driver's route choice can effectively described by Logit Model with variables of traffic signal split and route familiarity.

To be able to plan and dimension for the expected (increase) in data traffic it is important to have a model for the traffic that will flow through the network. A concept often talked about in conjunction with M2M communications is the âInternet of thingsâ, where billions of âsmartâ objects are connected to the Internet and can be easily shared and used or re-used by many applications. One sub-field of M2M communications is sensor/actuator networks that are installed in households, creating automated homes by enabling home appliances to talk to each other and to applications that can be running on hosts connected to the Internet. Such sensor/actuator networks extend the uses of home appliances into completely new and exciting applications, while also potentially making homes more energy efficient by smarter management and operation of these appliances.

Officers from the Crime Suppression Division and the Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division of the Royal Thai Police have arrested a Thai man and a Vietnamese man in connection with the crime. All three species are protected in Thailand, and are all listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).  The animals, found chopped up and stuffed into a freezer in the house, were believed to have been sourced from Malaysia and moved through Sadao, a district in the southern Thai province of Songkla, which shares a border with Malaysia.  Initial investigations have shown the animals were bound for China via Nong Khai, a town near the border between Thailand and Lao PDR.   From Nong Khai, the animals were to be transported across the Mekong River to Lao PDR before being moved to China.  Police said the suspects were paid 8,000 Baht (USD250) to transport the animals from the south of Thailand to Bangkok.  The seized animals have been handed over to the Wildlife First Aid Clinic where samples will be taken for DNA analysis.  âAny DNA analysis should be undertaken with an eye toward establishing the origins of these animals. Going forward, it will be important to know exactly where they came from.â noted TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director, Dr. William Schaedla.  âWe also hope the Thai authorities will undertake a thorough investigation of the transport routes being utilized by the smugglers and co-ordinate with their counterparts in neighboring countries.

AB  - For a local area road network, the available traffic data of traveling are the flow volumes in the key intersections, not the complete OD matrix. Considering the circumstance characteristic and the data availability of a local area road network, a new model for traffic assignment based on Monte Carlo simulation of intersection turning movement is provided in this paper. For good stability in temporal sequence, turning ratio is adopted as the important parameter of this model. The formulation for local area road network assignment problems is proposed on the assumption of random turning behavior. The traffic assignment model based on the Monte Carlo method has been used in traffic analysis for an actual urban road network. The results comparing surveying traffic flow data and determining flow data by the previous model verify the applicability and validity of the proposed methodology.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Control in urban traffic networks constitutes an important and challenging research topic nowadays. In the literature, a lot of work can be found devoted to improving the performance of the traffic flow in such systems, by means of controlling the red-to-green switching times of traffic signals. Different techniques have been proposed and commercially implemented, ranging from heuristic methods to model-based optimization. However, given the complexity of the dynamics and the scale of urban traffic networks, there is still a lot of scope for improvement. In this work, a new hybrid model for the traffic behavior at an intersection is introduced. It captures important aspects of the flow dynamics in urban networks. It is shown how this model can be used in order to obtain control strategies that improve the flow of traffic at intersections, leading to the future possibility of controlling several connected intersections in a distributed way.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are the major solutions to relieving traffic congestion. Traffic signal control and route guidance, two key subsystems of ITS, jointly influence traffic flow in time and space. Over the last three decades, combined traffic signal control and route guidance (CTSCRG) has been research emphasis. There are two kinds of model for describing CTSCRG: multiple user class traffic assignment model and discrete choice model. The intent of the paper is to compare the traffic equilibrium results of these two models. For describing route guidance system which is composed of guided driver and non-guided driver, the concept of multiple user class (MUC) is introduced. In MUC traffic assignment model, guided drivers are modeled as complete information user equilibrium traffic assignment, and non-guided drivers are modeled as stochastic user equilibrium traffic assignment. In discrete choice model, guided drivers and non-guided drivers are modeled as stochastic dynamic user optimum and route choice model is logit model. The perception error of non-guided drivers is larger than the perception error of guided drivers. In this paper, perception error is the function of current travel time and sampled from uniform distribution. Because simulation-based method can allow more complex interactions and win in reality value than travel time formula, we combine Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with cellular automata simulation to calculate travel time and optimize signal setting plan. Iterative simulation and assignment procedure is built: road is discretized by cellular automata. Traffic flow dynamics is represented by cell transmission model; signal setting is optimized by hybrid genetic algorithm; vehicle agent can receive route guidance information and select suggested route. Comparison results show that MUC traffic assignment model converge, discrete choice model does not converge. Average delay of MUC traffic assignment model is lower than that of discrete-

AB  - A distributed regional traffic signal control method for the high-density network is proposed according to the characteristics of the high-density network. The method adopts the distributed architecture to improve the effectiveness of system optimization and the stability of system operation, which is suitable for the high-density network where the distribution of intersections is dense and traffic flow varies frequently. The method takes travel time delay and average queue ratio as the optimal objectives to build the traffic signal optimal model based on cell transmission model, and employs the discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm and goal programming principles to optimize the traffic control parameters of the intersections. This method can improve the reaction speed for each intersection, timely optimize and assign space-time resource for the traffic flow in the network, and eliminate the gridlock caused by the too long queue that spreads to the upstream intersection.

Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - With the rapid increase of the urban vehicle's number, the contradiction between the vehicle and road has become increasingly remarkable, and the bottleneck effect of the intersection has become more striking. Practices have proved that reasonable controlling on traffic signal light in the city and designing reasonable signal timing control system can play a significant role in solving the problems such as traffic pollution and traffic energy consumption. Meanwhile, it can contribute to the implementation of the security, speediness and comfort of traffic flow. Based on the characteristics of the urban road traffic flow, this article puts forward an optimization timing plan of the synchronous change of signal lights timing and traffic flow rate in the single intersection, and evaluates the data through computer simulation. The results show that the number of queuing vehicles after being optimized reduces by 30% than that before optimization.

AB  - Due to the many complex aspects of a traffic system, it has been
difficult to determine the optimal signal timing. Much of this
difficulty has stemmed from the need to build extremely complex models
of the traffic dynamics as a component of the control strategy. This
paper presents a fundamentally different approach for optimal signal
timing that eliminates the need for such complex models. The approach is
based on a neural network serving as the basis for the control law, with
the weight estimation occurring in closed-loop mode via the simultaneous
perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. Since the SPSA
algorithm requires only loss function measurements, there is no
system-wide model required for the weight estimation

AB  - A coordination of vehicle flows is usually reached by a cyclical operation of traffic lights, and by synchronizing these cycles. The typical conditions, however, for which traffic lights are normally optimized for, never occur exactly. Large fluctuations in the number of vehicles arriving during one cycle time may lead to an inefficient usage of green times, which are often either too short or too long. The method we propose here allows for variable adjustments not only of the duration, but also of the order of green phases, while it reaches at least the same intersection throughput capacity as an optimized fixed-time controller. This is particularly important, when intersections are highly saturated, road networks are heterogeneous, or if public transport is to be prioritized. We reach the stabilization of queues and red-time durations by a decentralized supervision of (potentially unstable) locally optimizing traffic light controllers. The proposed supervisory concept makes sure that all network flows get a green light regularly and long enough. In addition, it enables flexible responses to local fluctuations in the demand, and it favors a self-organized coordination of traffic flows. In a simulation of the city center of Dresden, Germany, we could compare the proposed concept with an adaptive state-of-the-art controller (which has been optimized within the same simulation suite and includes green waves). Results indicate that not only the mean value of travel times is reduced, but also in their variance, which is positive for the reliability of public transport and individual trip scheduling.

AB  - Most existing dynamic traffic assignment models assume that drivers have sufficient knowledge on roadway networks. However, past experiments have shown that drivers' familiarity with the network layout is an essential component in route selections. In this paper, the concept of recognition level is defined to categorize drivers based on their unfamiliarity of the network and of the alternative routes between origins and destinations. Each catalog is assigned a specific utility function that is dependent on travel time, length of route and recognition parameters. Drivers' route choice behavior is determined by these specific utility functions. A sample network is first employed to test the feasibility of the proposed model, and the result complies with the specified travel patterns. After that, a real network near downtown Houston is used to further test the proposed model. An experiment is conducted based on the information collected from an on-site survey and the on-line realtime traffic map from Houston TranStar. In order to validate the necessity of the proposed model, a control experiment is carried out with all parameters being set in the same way as the designed experiment except that drivers are assumed to be fully familiar with the network layout and alternative routes. Test results show that the proposed model better fit the real case.

AB  - Presents the research agenda of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) addressing safety issues related to younger (aged 15-24) and older (aged 65 and older) drivers. For younger drivers, the NHTSA will develop programs, activities, and procedures to help build safe driving habits, and evaluations will be conducted to assess the impact of programs intended to reduce crashes, including provisional licensing and lower blood alcohol concentration limits for those under age 21. In the past, NHTSA worked with the American Association of Motor Administrators in developing guidelines for the states to use when dealing with driving problems that may be related to aging. Unfortunately, many of these efforts lacked detailed information on the difficulties caused by aging. In the future, the agency's efforts will focus on identifying and analyzing research data linking declining physical and mental capabilities of older individuals to their driving safety. Following these activities, NHTSA will recommend appropriate driving practices for persons with various conditions and develop information to assist them in making safe driving choices. Additionally, the agency will develop guidelines for families, medical practitioners, and others to identify those older individuals who have driving problems. NHTSA will also assess the use of improved technologies and vehicle crashworthiness characteristics. It is important to determine that technologies arising from Intelligence Vehicle and Highway Systems do not, in fact, overload the decision-making and informational capacities of older drivers. Charts and figures illustrate driving safety data, broken down among various age groups from 15 to 85 and older. (AgeLine Database, copyright 1993 AARP, all rights reserved)

AB  - It has been approved that the scale-free feature exists in various complex networks, such as the internet, the cell or the biological networks. In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - A trend is emerging among architects, urban planners, and others traditionally in demand of scale-models and 3D vi- sualisations away from what will this look like? models to what will this look like, and how will it work? simulations. Amajor demand of these simulations is the addition of real- istic urban traffic in a non-intrusive, scalable way such that massive amounts of road traffic can incorporated. This kind of feature can be used to demonstrate how intersections and pedestrian areas in proposed new building cope with traffic flow. It allows lay-persons to better immerse in and ap- preciate a proposed design or reconstruction, and is also a highly valuable resource for increasing the realism of com- puter games and animations. To address this challenge we have designed a system for rapidly laying a working road- network within an existing 3D simulation, coupled with an agent-based approach to traffic simulation such that every vehicle has its own intelligence, goals, and decision-making ability.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. Â© 1995.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field âscience of complexityâ has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Todayâs self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic âpatternsâ. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially âenslavesâ its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the âhigherâ level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the âlowerâ levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

The problem domain, a freeway network integration management application considers the efficiency and equity of system, is formulated as a distributed fuzzy reinforcement learning problem. The Gini coefficient is adopted in this study as an indicator of equity. The DFRL approach was implemented via a multi-agent control architecture where the decision agent was assigned to each of the on-ramp or VMS. The reward of each agent is simultaneously updating a single shared policy. The control strategy's effect is demonstrated through its application to the simple freeway network. Analyses of simulation results using this approach show the equity of the system have a significant improvement over traditional control, especially for the case of large traffic demand. Using the DFRL approach, Compared with traditional methods, the network's Gini coefficient has fallen by 30% or more.

The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

Traffic control strategy will influence the driver's route choices, so these effects should reflect in the dynamic traffic assignment.

The traffic control strategy will influence the road impedance, which is one of important constraint conditions in dynamic traffic assignment.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

Those associated primarily with food, ornamental use, timber or fuel have been excluded. The report examines the exploitation of native European medicinal and aromatic plants, investigates the trade of medicinal and aromatic plants in Europe, and recommends actions to ensure the legal and sustainable use of the taxa involved. The findings are based on country-specific surveys carried out in Albania, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Spain, Turkey and the UK during 1994-97. International trade data from the UNCTAD Comtrade database were also analysed. In Europe, at least 2000 species are used on a commercial basis, some 1200-1300 of which are native to Europe. Of these, 90% are still wild collected (some 20 000-30 000 t/yr). Wild collection is particularly prominent in Albania, Turkey, Hungary and Spain. In the EU, medicinal and aromatic plants are cultivated on an estimated 70 000 ha, the main countries being France, Hungary and Spain. Analysis of trade data revealed that Europe imports about a quarter of annual global market imports (440 000 t valued at $1.3 billion in 1996). Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the UK are among the 12 leading countries of import and Germany, Bulgaria and Poland are among the 12 leading countries of export. Legislation relating to the harvest and trade of medicinal and aromatic plants in Europe is considered. In national reports, about 150 species were reported to be threatened in at least one European country as a result of over-collection from the wild. Detailed descriptions of 15 taxa reported as threatened are presented. Species subjected to international, European or national legislation and/or reported as threatened in a number of reports are tabulated. The recommendations made in this report for the conservation of medicinal and aromatic plant species propose action in the spheres of trade monitoring; adjustments to legislation; improvement to law enforcement; regulation, in particular, of the trade in orchid bulbs used for salep; in situ and ex situ protection; improved management programmes; public awareness initiatives; enhancement of cultivation efforts; future research into trade in wild-harvested plants; and certification of plant material from sustainable sources.

Various researchers have reported traffic measurements that demonstrate considerable burstiness on a range of time scales with properties of self-similarity. Rapid technological development has widened the scope of network and Internet applications and, in turn, increased traffic volume. The exponential growth of the number of servers, as well as the number of users, causes Internet performance to be problematic as a result of the significant impact that long-range dependent traffic has on buffer requirements. Consequently, accurate and reliable measurement, analysis and control of Internet traffic are vital. The most significant techniques for performance evaluation include theoretical analysis, simulation, and empirical study based on measurement. In this research, we discuss existing and recent developments in performance evaluation and control tools used in network traffic engineering.

AB  - This paper proposes a method to solve shortest path problems in route choice processes when each link's travel time is a fuzzy number, called the Perceived Travel Time (PTT). The PTT is a subjective travel time perceived by a driver. The algorithm solves the fuzzy shortest path problem (FSPA) for drivers in the presence of uncertainty regarding route travel time. For congested networks, the method is able to find the shortest path in terms of perceived travel time and degree of saturation (congestion) along routes at the same time. The FSPA can be used to support the fuzzification of traffic assignment algorithms. The applicability of the resulting FSPA for the traffic assignment was tested in conjunction with incremental traffic loading and was applied to a large-scale real network. The results of the traffic assignment based on the FSPA, User Equilibrium (UE) and a stochastic loading network model (Dial's assignment algorithm) were compared to the observed volume for certain links in the network. We conclude that the proposed method offers better accuracy than the UE or Dial's assignment algorithm for the network under testing.

AB  - Microscopic simulation of traffic, while often necessary to capture the effects of interest, is a computationally expensive simulation strategy. What can be observed, however, is that the accuracy required from the simulation for post simulation analysis can depend on the simulated world and vary over simulated time - roads becoming crowded may be simulated differently than sparsely used roads. In this paper we explore multi-model simulation as an adaptive simulation strategy. Multi-model simulations are capable of selecting and switching to a suitable simulation model at runtime, based on the state of the simulated world. This simulation strategy reduces the computational complexity of traffic microsimulations while still maintaining the desired level of accuracy needed to produce meaningful results. We illustrate the approach via an experimental set-up that allows switching between a road queue model and a fully detailed road simulation model.

AB  - In current societies, the presence of an organized civil society is becoming more evident, and its duties affect and provoke transformations in the relation of power between governmental institutions and social actors, such as Non-governmental Organizations, Committees, Civil Associations, etc. Some of these changes and transformations in the relations of power have been so significant that they have influenced the design of new institutional initiatives, through which civil societies acquire more capacities for negotiation, management and incidence in the decision-making process across different levels of the government. Under this premise, this work focuses on the case study of the Public Works Committee of the Sport Unit of Santa MÃ³nica, in Santa MÃ³nica, Ocuilan, with the intention of analyzing the ways that this Committee is influencing the urban growth of this settlement, so that in this way it would be possible to identify ways for the social movements to organize for the promotion of urban growth and development.

AB  - In order to generate self-similar network traffics, researchers designed network traffic simulation system using sequential methods to generate network traffics with self-similar property on a short time scale. But there is one difficulty in how the simulation system can generate network traffics with high accuracy on a much larger time scale. So, in this paper, we present an architecture design for the distributed testing system of generating self-similar network traffic based on parallel methods and implement it via TCP/IP. We also carry out some experiments to show that this distributed system can generate highly accurate network traffics in specified Hurst parameters.

AB  - This paper presents a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model for urban multi-modal transportation network by conÂ­structing a mesoscopic simulation model. Several traffic means such as private car, subway, bus and bicycle are conÂ­sidered in the network. The mesoscopic simulator consists of a mesoscopic supply simulator based on MesoTS model and a time-dependent demand simulator. The mode choice is siÂ­multaneously considered with the route choice based on the improved C-Logit model. The traffic assignment procedure is implemented by a time-dependent shortest path (TDSP) alÂ­gorithm in which travellers choose their modes and routes based on a range of choice criteria. The model is particularly suited for appraising a variety of transportation management measures, especially for the application of Intelligent TransÂ­port Systems (ITS). Five example cases including OD demand level, bus frequency, parking fee, information supply and car ownership rate are designed to test the proposed simulation model through a medium-scale case study in Beijing ChaoyÂ­ang District in China. Computational results illustrate excelÂ­lent performance and the application of the model to analyÂ­sis of urban multi-modal transportation networks.

AB  - In this paper, a cellular automaton model of vehicular traffic in a Manhattan-like urban system is proposed. In this model, the origin-destination trips and traffic lights have been considered. The system exhibits three different states, i.e. moving state, saturation state and global deadlock state. With a grid coarsening method, vehicle distribution in the moving state and the saturation state has been studied. Interesting structures (e.g. windmill-like ones, T-shirt-like ones, Y-like ones) have been revealed. A metastability of the system is observed in the transition from the saturation state to the global deadlock state. The effect of an advanced traveller information system (ATIS), the traffic light period and the traffic light switch strategy have also been investigated.

AB  - The classical Wardrop principle assumes that users minimize either individual travel cost or overall system cost. Unlike the pure Wardrop equilibrium, this study deals with the problem of user equilibrium traffic assignment with game theory. We present a Stackelberg game on the network in which the SO player is the leader and the Cournot-Nash and user equilibrium players are the followers. The Cournot-Nash and user equilibrium players select the route, which is given the SO player's routing. In contrast, the SO player select the routes to minimize total system travel cost. Based on combined model, the traffic assignment method was discussed, and the VI and generalized Lagrange multiplier method was used to get the solution. A simple example is presented. The example result shows that the efficient of Stackelberg model is higher than that of the UE system or SO system.

AB  - Currently most optimization methods for urban transport networks (i) are suited for networks with simplified dynamics that are far from real-sized networks or (ii) apply decentralized control, which is not appropriate for heterogeneously loaded networks or (iii) investigate good-quality solutions through micro-simulation models and scenario analysis, which make the problem intractable in real time. In principle, traffic management decisions for different sub-systems of a transport network (urban, freeway) are controlled by operational rules that are network specific and independent from one traffic authority to another. In this paper, the macroscopic traffic modeling and control of a large-scale mixed transportation network consisting of a freeway and an urban network is tackled. The urban network is partitioned into two regions, each one with a well-defined Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD), i.e. a unimodal and low-scatter relationship between region density and outflow. The freeway is regarded as one alternative commuting route which has one on-ramp and one off-ramp within each urban region. The urban and freeway flow dynamics are formulated with the tool of MFD and asymmetric cell transmission model, respectively. Perimeter controllers on the border of the urban regions operating to manipulate the perimeter interflow between the two regions, and controllers at the on-ramps for ramp metering are considered to control the flow distribution in the mixed network. The optimal traffic control problem is solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach in order to minimize total delay in the entire network. Several control policies with different levels of urban-freeway control coordination are introduced and tested to scrutinize the characteristics of the proposed controllers. Numerical results demonstrate how different levels of coordination improve the performance once compared with independent control for freeway and urban network. The approach presented in this paper can be extended to implement efficient real-world control strategies for large-scale mixed traffic networks. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The physical division of one cell into two requires the highly orchestrated separation of genetic and cytoplasmic contents during M phase of the cell cycle. Mitosis, the physical segregation of the genetic material of a cell into two daughter cells, has traditionally received more attention than cytokinesis, the partitioning of the cytoplasmic contents, yet clearly the two processes must be intimately co-ordinated and tightly regulated. While plant cells divide by the formation of a membranous cell barrier called the phragmoplast, animal cell division is largely driven by contraction of an actomyosin ring. However, recent evidence has suggested that membranes derived from one or more intracellular compartments are also required to break the cytoplasmic bridge connecting two dividing cells during late telophase. In this review, we focus on studies of animal cell cytokinesis that support a requirement for specific endomembrane fusion during fission, define molecular components of the membrane fusion apparatus that may be involved and point to possible roles for an emerging family of cytoskeletal proteins, the septins, in this process.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we simplify a fluidodynamic traffic model and derive a new traffic flow model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is obtained by spatial discretization of an averaged density evolution and a suitable approximation of the coupling conditions at junctions of the network. We show that the new model inherits similar features of the full model, e.g., traffic jam propagation. We consider optimal control problems controlled by the ODE model and derive the optimality system. We present numerical results on the simulation and optimization of traffic flow in sample networks.

Over the theory the realization of the control method is also presented. To validate the effectiveness of the controller a busy traffic network was chosen for test field. The MPC strategy was implemented into the test network control system (hardware in loop simulation). The applied environment is a microscopic traffic simulator with mathematical software and proper computational applications for the evaluation. The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the designed MPC based traffic control strategy. The system is able to improve the network efficiency and reduce travel time, creating optimal flow in the network subjected to control input constraints.

AB  -  This paper deals with an Agent-based Model of a Decision-Support System for an Urban Transport Network. The present Multi-Agent Decision-Support System (MADSS) assists the regulator in the search of the appropriate regulation decisions in case of a bus traffic disturbance. It is composed of a Supervision Module and a Regulation Module that rely on the information given by the Automatic Vehicle Monitoring system (AVM). The supervision Module represents the temporal axis of the network by the agents of type BUS and the spatial axis by the agents STOP. These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach. Hence, through the cooperative aspects of the agent interactions, the MADSS is able to perform a coherent and preventive regulation process.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to deÂ¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system deÂ¯nition during the design process to include the network deÂ¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to deÂ¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network deÂ¯nition to Â¯nd a system-level solution that best satisÂ¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network deÂ¯nition for a selected few cities with a Â¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-deÂ¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ineÂ±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

AB  - Traffic signal conspicuity is likely to be a factor behind difficulties in detecting traffic signals. There is increasing interest in South Australia in providing mast arm mounted traffic signals at intersections to increase traffic signal conspicuity and reduce specific crash types. This report aims to review best practice principles in the conspicuity of traffic signals and determine the extent to which poor conspicuity of traffic signals contributes to crashes at signalised intersections. Without any recent Australian studies, it is difficult to determine the extent to which crashes result from a failure to detect traffic signals. According to best practice principles, the installation of additional traffic signals on mast arms at intersections has potential to improve traffic signal conspicuity. The second aim of this report is to attempt to quantify any road safety benefits in terms of crash reductions for installing additional signals, specifically traffic signals on mast arms at intersections. Research evidence from a number of evaluations shows that the installation of mast arms at intersections is associated with effects ranging from an estimated 89 per cent reduction in the total number of crashes to a 21 per cent increase in crashes. The greatest crash reductions were reported for right angle crashes (15-100%) while left turn crashes (equivalent to right turn in Australia) were associated with small crash reductions. Although this review shows that mast arms were associated with some crash reductions, it is important to note that these findings are not conclusive as many of the evaluations suffered from poor methodological design.

AB  - The consequences and outward signs of urban growth are increasingly being called into question. In particular, urban growth involves new travel practices which change old urban references. The urban space as experienced by the inhabitants does not necessarily follow the administrative borders of towns. This involves an increase in the use of the private car, the mode most adapted to this new urban reality. And this raises the question of the influence on road safety. Links between urban growth, new travel practices and road safety have been little dealt with in the literature. The article looks therefore into the question of the consequences of urban growth on travel practices and their influence on road safety problems. To deal with this question, a "life territory" was defined to account for new travel practices. This method gives a better picture of new urban realities. The study was carried out in the area of Salon-de- Provence (France). An analysis of urban evolution in the area was then placed alongside the evolution of road safety. And the results show that the question of the influence of urban growth on road safety can be posed in terms of a reflection on the effects of road network management and road improvement. Urban growth causes road safety problems due to the increase in traffic and use of the networks, but these can be managed to a certain degree. And reflections should include the effects of regulations within the urban system. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities, both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes, road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes, and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads due to different travel purposes, problems from using current non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes: comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km. The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research estables a three-tier NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift), NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms, benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network at the urban central area of Beijing is built up. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Transportation planning models do not usually consider intersection delays explicitly in calculating path travel times. However, because intersection delays often make up a considerable portion of total travel time in urban areas, ignoring them will result in inaccuracy in model results. Incorporating intersection delays into a traffic assignment model presents several challenges. One is that future signal timing plans are unknown, and another is that introducing intersection delays into traffic assignment renders the necessary condition for convergence invalid. This paper proposes a pragmatic approach to considering intersection delays in traffic assignment by assuming that signal timing plans will be optimized for given traffic conditions and by demonstrating that a convergent solution can be obtained when intersection delays are explicitly accounted for. A large data set of traffic volume combinations representing the operation of an intersection and the corresponding intersection delays based on optimized signal timing are obtained from TRANSYT-7F. This data set is used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) model that provides delay estimates for given traffic conditions for certain types of intersection configurations. An iterative process of traffic assignment and delay estimation is carried out to obtain a stable assignment solution. The delay estimates from the ANN delay model are evaluated by the percentage root mean squared errors, which are less than 25.6%, with larger prediction errors typically associated with severely oversaturated conditions. An example is presented to show the use of the delay model in traffic assignment. The delay model allows the concurrent optimization of signal controls and traffic routing to obtain a local optimum network solution.

AB  - User equilibrium is a central concept for studying transportation networks, and one can view it as the result of a dynamical process of drivers' route choice behavior. In this paper, based on a definition of O-D First-In-First-Out violation, we propose a new dynamical system model of the route choice behavior at the aggregate, route level for both static and dynamic transportation networks. An equilibrium of such a dynamical system can be a user equilibrium or a partial user equilibrium. We prove that, for static, symmetric traffic assignment problem with fixed or variable demand, only user equilibria are stable for the dynamical system, and the objective function in the mathematical programming formulation (Beckmann, McGuire, and Winsten, 1956) can be considered as the potential energy of the dynamical system. We then present an Euler-based perturbation method for finding user equilibrium and solve two examples for both static and dynamic traffic assignment problems. This new model is simple in form and could be applied to analyze other properties of transportation networks.

AB  - The dynamic traffic control problem and the dynamic traffic assignment problem are integrated as a noncooperative game between a traffic authority and highway users. The objective of the combined control-assignment problem is to find a mutually consistent dynamic system-optimal signal setting and dynamic user-optimal traffic flow. The combined control-assignment problem is first formulated as a one-level Cournot game: the traffic authority and the users choose their strategies simultaneously. The combined control-assignment problem is subsequently formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The traffic authority is the leader; it determines the signal settings in anticipation of the users' reactions. The users are followers who choose their routes after the signal settings have been determined. Finally, the system-optimal control-assignment problem is formulated as a Monopoly game. The sole player-the traffic authority-determines both signal settings and traffic flows to achieve a dynamic system-optimal solution. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the equilibria of the games.

The adopted robustness measure is the weighted sum of expected total system travel time (TSTT) and squared up-side deviation from a fixed target. The model propagates traffic according to Daganzo's cell transmission model. Furthermore, we formulate five additional, related models. We find that when evaluated in terms of robustness, the integrated robust model performs the best, and interestingly the sequential robust approach yields a worse solution compared to certain sequential and integrated approaches. Although the adopted objective of the integrated robust model does not directly optimize the variance of TSTT, our experimental results show that the robust solutions also yield the least-variance solutions.

AB  - The management of severe congestion in complex urban networks calls for dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) models that can replicate real traffic situations with long queues and spillbacks. DynaMIT-P, a mesoscopic traffic simulation system, was enhanced and calibrated to capture the traffic characteristics in a sub-area of Beijing, China. The network had 1698 nodes and 3180 directed links in an area of around 18 square miles. There were 2927 non-zero origin-destination (OD) pairs and around 630,000 vehicles were simulated over 4. h of the morning peak. All demand and supply parameters were calibrated simultaneously using sensor counts and floating car travel time data. Successful calibration was achieved with the Path-size Logit route choice model, which accounted for overlapping routes. Furthermore, explicit representations of lane groups were required to properly model traffic delays and queues. A modified treatment of acceptance capacity was required to model the large number of short links in the transportation network (close to the length of one vehicle). In addition, even though bicycles and pedestrians were not explicitly modeled, their impacts on auto traffic were captured by dynamic road segment capacities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Discovering traffic bottlenecks and taking action to alleviate congestion to enhance the performance of a traffic network are the most important tasks for the advanced traffic management system in the intelligent transportation system. However, traffic bottlenecks are affected by several factors and vary with spatial and temporal environments, which makes them difficult to define and discover. This paper proposes a three-phase spatiotemporal traffic bottleneck mining (STBM) model, including several spatiotemporal traffic patterns and STBM algorithms that use the raw data of location-based services to discover urban network spatiotemporal traffic bottlenecks. This paper implements an STBM prototype system based on a taxi dispatching system in a Taipei, Taiwan, urban network. The experimental results show that the congestion prediction capability of the proposed heuristic methods (congestion-propagation heuristic) is up to 79.6% during workdays and 72.1% on weekends, which outperforms other methods (e.g., the congestion-converge heuristic, the congestion-drop heuristic, and congested object item), and the discovered spatiotemporal bottlenecks match the travelers' experience.

AB  - From the mid nineteenth century, the City of Dessau (Germany) developed as an economic centre. The development of new residential and industrial areas changed the natural landscape having an adverse impact on the surface water, soil water and groundwater regimes. Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - The optimum control of traffic in urban networks is an important requirement of city authorities as they seek efficient and sustainable transport. A feature of most urban networks is the high density of city streets with numerous road junctions, which require efficient control mechanisms if congestion is to be contained. Traffic signals have become the most widely used form of control in this context, with increasing sophistication in detection and real-time optimization providing new levels of efficiency. A changing policy background in many cities has also required greater emphasis in traffic control on the needs of public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and on the need to minimize vehicle emissions. This paper provides an overview of problems, methods, systems and applications in the context of urban network traffic control, concluding with a look at future needs. The paper focuses particularly on signallized junctions within computer-controlled urban traffic control (UTC) systems, which are increasingly at the heart of traffic control in cities around the world.

The hybrid model is important to large-scale real-time network simulations, where the packet-level emulation traffic is handled by discrete events and the majority of the background traffic is described more efficiently as fluids. We present a simple performance analysis of this hybrid approach. We propose three techniques-namely, pointer caching, update dampening, and dynamic time stepping-in an implementation of the hybrid model. Experiments show that these techniques can significantly improve the performance of the fluid-based network simulation.

AB  - It is very important to select hub nodes or key junctions before urban traffic signal control system (SCOOT or SCATS) divides control sub-areas. Usually, traffic flow and link numbers are used as indexes to find out which hub nodes are in urban traffic network. However, these indexes could not reflect the traffic network topology characteristics like free scale features which are very helpful to protect the effectiveness of regional traffic signal control system under `intentional attack' of traffic incidents. In this paper, new method of node importance analysis, hub node selection and application of urban traffic complex network is discussed. Firstly, urban traffic network is abstracted as weighted complex traffic network using junction as node and travel expense (travel time) as link weight. Secondly, using network cohesion as index, weighted node contraction method is applied to evaluate the importance of node and effective results are shown applying it on simulation network. Finally, based on hub node selection, SCATS system optimization strategies are also illustrated.

AB  - The problem of traffic congestion is attracting lots of attention with the aim of investigating efficient solutions. To achieve models that comprehensively describe the system, useful data from the network is needed. A suggestion is to mount detectors in selected regions and study the system responses to various stimuli. This, however, might be costly and impractical in many cases. Traffic simulators are beneficial tools for providing a simulated environment of the network. The current study tries to develop a traffic simulator within NetLogo, an agent-based environment. Using this simulator, the effect of different light plans on average delay time (ADT) of vehicles is investigated. The results indicate that in a normal-sized network a better choice is the simultaneous change of lights. A long length is appropriate for low entering frequencies and an average length is more efficient for high entering frequencies. In geometrically bigger networks, lights are better to change every other one with an average length for low entering frequencies and a long length for high entering frequencies.

AB  - This paper shows the similarity between transportation networks and thermodynamic systems. In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The implementation of a tram system within a highway network results in the fundamental need to review the existing traffic signal control system. The principal aim of such a system is to provide a fast and efficient service, and ultimately reduce the reliance on the private car. In order to ensure that projected journey times on the route are realised, delays to tram vehicles are minimised by providing a tram priority mode as a higher priority within the normal mode hierarchy. Clearly, this will have some level of detrimental effect on all other road users, and therefore any tram priority mode introduced also needs to ensure all other road user demands are serviced within a reasonable period of time. This paper describes all aspects of the tram priority system to be introduced for the Nottingham Express Transit (NET) scheme, including the overall tram and highway control system, the tram detector system, the complex traffic signal controller logic applied to ensure maximum tram priority, the provision of additional UTC functions to improve the monitoring capability of the system, and the remedial measures applied to ensure that all tram operations are maintained during various fault scenarios.

AB  - A traffic condition identification method based on regional road network was put forward in order to accurately identify real-time traffic condition and distribution of road network. On the analysis of the traffic status parameters of the intersection and section, the road network model was built. With the average travel time as the traffic parameters of regional network, traffic condition analysis models were built. The connected matrix and reach ability matrix were used to identify the traffic states of network. The case analysis results show that the connected matrix and reach ability matrix could reflect the connectivity of intersections and the reach ability of different paths under different traffic crowded degree threshold, and could find out the key intersections and key sections in the network. It could be used to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of traffic state of the whole network. The simulation result shows that the method of traffic state judgment of road network is feasible, which can be used in traffic control, traffic information release and traffic induction.

The effectiveness of accidents prevention programs can be increased by changing periodically the position of the available ISCs on a given time horizon. To this aim, we propose a novel multiperiod maximal covering location approach designed to maximize the overall coverage on the whole discretized time horizon.

AB  - The technologies and applications aiming at the dynamic properties of micro-level road traffic have made plenty of contributions for the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in past decades, which causes a lack of understanding and analysis for the dynamical properties of the whole structure at macro-level. Therefore, in this paper, we construct the Variable-Structure Dynamic Network modle (VSDN) and the Extended Variable-Structure Dynamic Network model (EVSDN) for urban road traffic systems, basing on the Level-Of-Service (LOS) and the traffic reachability. The VSDN model defines the edge set at any time includes only the edges whose LOS lies in un-congestion levels, which causes that the structure of the urban road traffic network varies with time. Furthermore, we extend VSDN to EVSDN that redefines the edge set to combine the micro-level time-varying characteristics into the macro-level topology. The experiments with traffic data and topology data of the Beijing road traffic system show that the EVSDN model is scale-free at some peak-time phases and the appearance of the scale-free property represents the significant change of topological features of urban road traffic networks. During rush hours, the scale-free property can be used to characterize urban road traffic networks.

AB  - This paper presents a vehicle routing problem in dynamic urban traffic network with real-time traffic information. Both re-current and non-recurrent congestion are considered in the problem. We develop a method to solve the problem by combining the initial routes arrangement with the real-time route adjustment. The initial route planning is made by solving a time-dependent vehicle routing problem under recurrent congestion conditions. The genetic algorithm is applied. During the plan implementation, a new mechanism updating at the critical node is proposed to adjust the routes with real-time traffic information subject to the unexpected traffic accidents in non-recurrent congestion environment. Through the numerical simulation, the results show that the new route updating mechanism is more effective than others in the literatures, and the advantage by adopting the new mechanism becomes more prominent when the network becomes more dynamic.

AB  - Quality of traffic messaging is currently defined in terms of quantitative or technical characteristics that relate almost exclusively to the broadcasting of the information. This pays insufficient attention to the traffic messagesâ content and conformity with the real situation experienced by drivers. Accuracy of content however is a decisive factor in customer satisfaction and acceptance. Given these problems, this paper presents a new method for determining quality criteria, the aim being to assist independent and objective assessment of traffic information. Three extensive test series were carried out to assess the quality of traffic information reporting. The tests include a study and comparison of both private and public traffic information providers. Two indices QKZ1 and QKZ2 are defined to describe quality. This process, which is derived from the area of signal detection theory, offers the possibility of continuously measuring the quality with which traffic information is reported and comparing traffic information services objectively.

The congestion pricing models for two time periods (peak and off-peak) and two travel modes (car and bus) on a general urban highway network are constructed and are resolved by an excess-demand approach. A simulation study is conducted to analyze the temporal, spatial and modal effects of congestion tolls. Then the sensitivity analysis of key parameters is conducted to test the stability of the model. The main findings of this study are that congestion pricing schemes are effective in shifting peak time period traffic to the pre-peak time period; diverting traffic from tolled mode to untolled mode and from low occupancy vehicles to high occupancy vehicles.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a traffic signal optimisation model to improve real-time operations of traffic control systems. Advanced computer algorithms and traffic optimisation techniques can provide benefits over existing systems by reducing delays, improving travel times and reducing environmental emissions. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated by interfacing the traffic signal optimisation model to a microscopic traffic simulation tool, which enabled the evaluation of the benefits of the algorithm using computers in a controlled environment without disrupting traffic conditions. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is its ability to detect dynamic changes in traffic flow conditions by using short-term historical demand data obtained from upstream vehicle loop detectors. The experimental results for under-saturated traffic conditions showed that the algorithm's performance was superior to optimal fixed time control. The results also confirmed that as traffic volumes reach saturated conditions, the performance of the algorithm decreased but remained better than what can be achieved by fixed time control systems.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation systemâs capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - Full article: Geneva, Switzerland, 26th July 2012âStatisticians from the University of Reading in partnership with TRAFFIC are helping in the global fight against the trade of illegal ivory, with a major revision of the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), a global monitoring system for tracking illegal ivory trade.  With elephant poaching levels the worst they have been in a decade, and recorded ivory seizures at their highest levels since 1989, the revised system will give accurate and up-to-date information on the illegal trade of ivory. This will be of huge benefit for international and national policy makers on elephant conservation and on illicit trade who have previously struggled to get reliable and timely data.  At the heart of the upgrade is an innovative new database that allows countries to report seizures of illegal ivory online, making data entry easier and more accurate than ever before.  It will also encourage more countries to report illegal ivory trade as they will be able to access statistical summaries of their data and review other seizures where their country is implicated.  TRAFFIC manages ETIS on behalf of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). It is one of two elephant monitoring systems under CITES, the other being the Monitoring Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) system.  The revised online ETIS will be showcased today at the CITES Standing Committee currently taking place in Geneva. In attendance will be representatives from many of the CITES Parties who will use the revised system. They will witness the functionality and the effectiveness of the database by way of a demonstration, ahead of its launch in September 2012.  Bob Burn and Dr Fiona Underwood, statisticians from the University's Department of Mathematics and Statistics, have worked closely with TRAFFIC to develop the revised ETIS. Dr Underwood, project leader, said: "We are very pleased that we are able to provide a solid statistical foundation to ETIS to ensure that it provides high quality and timely information on the illegal ivory trade at a crucial time for elephants." Recording illegal ivory seizures is just one aspect of the revised monitoring system, which now has enhanced capability to provide indicators of hidden illegal activity.  Applied Statistics Research Fellow Bob Burn, who conceived the current project and has been involved with ETIS since its inception in 1997, said: "Not all illegal ivory transactions are discovered or officially reported.  The challenge in analysing seizures data is to adjust for this gap by accounting for factors such as law enforcement effort and corruption. Using cutting edge statistical methods the monitoring system can now begin to combat this problem."  The statistical analyses will provide information on how patterns of illegal trade are changing over time and will identify problem countries so that attention can be focused upon those countries most heavily implicated in illicit trade. This provides crucial evidence for CITES and individual governments in their decision making when it comes to elephant conservation. The work was carried out under a Darwin Initiative project, led by the University of Reading, funded by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).  UK Environment Minister Richard Benyon said: "These magnificent creatures are suffering horrific deaths at the hands of poachers, and if we don't act now they may not have a future. This database, funded by Defra's Darwin Initiative, will accurately record illegal ivory seizures so we get a real picture of what is happening on the ground. This information can be shared around the world to help stop the illegal trade in ivory and put poachers out of business."

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - The detected traffic data for single point or link cannot satisfy the needs for network-level traffic status information with the rapid development of the traffic control and guidance systems. This paper proposed a modeling and clustering method for network-level urban traffic status based on the dynamic traffic flow assignment ratios. The traffic assignment ratio matrix model integrates traffic status, topology and relation between links, with the dynamic traffic assignment ratios estimated by Linear Programming. The network-level traffic status is clustered by Self-Organizing Map and the typical patterns are discovered. The experiment proves the efficiency and applicability of this method for network-level traffic status modeling and analyzing.

AB  - The evaluation of ITS measures, such as advanced traveler
information systems and advanced traffic management systems depend
heavily on the use of faster than real time traffic simulation methods.
Although many micro-simulation traffic models have already been
developed, their execution times are still too slow for large-scale ITS
applications. This has lead to the development of mesoscopic simulation
and traffic assignment methods. These are simpler traffic models, which
trade off some of the fidelity of the results for significant gains in
computation time. This paper presents a new dynamic traffic assignment
model that is based on the mesoscopic space-time queue network loading
method developed by Mahut (2000). This hybrid optimization simulation
method was applied to a portion of the Stockholm road network, which
consists of 220 zones, 2080 links and 5000 turns

AB  -  The evaluation of on-line intelligent transportation system (ITS) measures, such as adaptive route-guidance and traffic management systems, depend heavily on the use of faster than real time traffic simulation models. Fast-running traffic models are needed off-line for use in iterative approaches that imitate drivers' adaptation to changes to the network topology. The paper describes a simulation-based dynamic-equilibrium traffic assignment model. The determination of time-dependent path flows is modeled as a master problem that is solved using the method of successive averages (MSA). The determination of path travel times for a given set of path flows is the network-loading sub-problem, which is solved using the space-time queueing approach of Mahut (2000). This loading method has been shown to provide reasonably accurate results with very little computational effort. The model was applied to the Stockholm road network, which consists of 4342 links, 1980 nodes and 250 zones, representing over 11,000 turns. The results show that this model is applicable to medium-size networks with a very reasonable computation time.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - Full article: Alor Star, Malaysia, 7th February 2013âA court case involving Malaysiaâs biggest ever seizure of trafficked Tiger parts today saw the conviction of a 29-year old man, who was sentenced to a total 60 months in prison. However Mohd Nor Shahrizam Nasir, found guilty on two charges of illegal possession of Tiger parts and one for possession of African Elephant ivory, will only serve 24 months in jail as the judge ordered that his sentences run concurrently. A conviction under the section of the law involving Tiger parts also carries a mandatory fine of "not less than RM100,000 and not more than RM500,000 and a jail term not exceeding five years.â However, the court did not issue the mandatory fine. In February last year, he was arrested at this home where Wildlife Department officers found eight Tiger skins, 22 bags of Tiger skulls and bones and nine African Elephant tusks.  Mohd Nor Shahrizam, from the town of Alor Star in northern Peninsular Malaysia claimed trial to charges under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2010. This morning he was handed down a sentence of 24 months each on the charges of keeping the eight Tiger skins, and the 22 Tiger skulls and bones. He received a further 12-month jail term on the third charge of keeping African Elephant tusks. Judge Mohd Rosli Osman granted the defence a stay pending an appeal and ordered that the convicted manâs bail, initially set at RM70,000, be increased by an additional RM10,000. If Mohd Nor Shahrizam raises bail, he will be free pending his appeal.   TRAFFIC welcomed the conviction but noted its concern that the sentence imposed contradicted the provision of the laws under which Mohd Nor Shahrizam was charged. âThis is shocking given that the mandatory fine is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is also disappointing considering it has taken 13 years of hard work and the effort of so many to include a punitive minimum fine for heinous wildlife crimes,â said TRAFFIC Southeast Asia Regional Director Dr William Schaedla. TRAFFIC has learnt that the prosecution will seek a revision of the sentence. Schaedla also disagreed with the argument raised by the defence during the trial; that the crime in question was insignificant because it did not involve loss of life. âSuch arguments fail to recognize that the arrest in this case was linked to the largest Tiger seizure Malaysia has ever seen â eight skins and the skulls and bones of 22 Tigers were impounded from the culpritâs Alor Star residence,â he said. âIt also contradicts recent international developments that are putting wildlife crime on a par with other serious crimes such as drugs and arms smuggling and human trafficking.â âThe short jail term and the lack of a fine are a demoralizing finale to what should have been a victory against wildlife crime. We hope the lapse does not crush the spirit of those authorities who are still working hard to protect Malaysiaâs 500 remaining Tigers.â

AB  - Traffic flow forecasting provides important information for both traffic control and traffic guidance. It should be both quick and accurate. A short-term traffic flow forecasting method is given based on the macroscopic urban traffic network model. The model is established to describe the substantial mechanism of traffic flow movement and the topology of the entire urban traffic network. It can simulate the traffic movement in the urban traffic network, and forecast the traffic flow states in the near future accurately. Also, the method has a good real-time feature due to the macroscopic model. In the simulation experiment, microscopic model CORSIM is used as the practical traffic system, and the proposed method is used to forecast the traffic flow of it. The simulation results show that the method has a good forecasting effectiveness.

AB  - In the context of serious congestion in most metropolitan areas and the development of intelligent transportation technology, variable message signs (VMS), as a part of route guidance system, are developed to alleviate congestion via providing drivers real-time travel information. It is expected that by providing dynamic travel time to drivers, both the congestion in network and average individual cost will be reduced. So getting the knowledge of the efficiency of a VMS system is important to researchers and designers. In order to evaluate the effects of variable message signs at urban network, a simulation-based, time-dependent traffic assignment model is proposed in this paper. The model uses a cell-based network loading model and the method of successive average algorithm to achieve stochastic user equilibrium at each sampling interval. A numerical example of the VMS system in Beijing is used to illustrate the effects of the variable message signs. The evaluation process is both based on network level and user level in situations of recurrent congestion and non-recurrent congestion. Finally a conclusion is drawn that the VMS system can alleviate congestion even if not all links in network are displayed by VMS.

AB  - A predictive continuum dynamic user-optimal (PDUO-C) model is formulated in this study to investigate the dynamic characteristics of traffic flow and the corresponding route-choice behavior of travelers within a region with a dense urban road network. The modeled region is arbitrary in shape with a single central business district (CBD) and travelers continuously distributed over the region. Within this region, the road network is represented as a continuum and travelers patronize a two-dimensional continuum transportation system to travel to the CBD. The PDUO-C model is solved by a promising solution algorithm that includes elements of the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method (FEM), and the explicit total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta (TVD-RK) time-stepping method. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the utility of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the solution algorithm in solving this PDUO-C problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - The existing network traffic signal optimization formulations usually do not include traffic flow models, except for control schemes such as {SCOOT} (Split, Cycle, and Offset Optimization Technique) system that uses simulation for heuristic optimization. Other conventional models normally use isolated intersection optimization with traffic arrival prediction using detector information, or optimization schemes based on green bandwidth approach such as {MAXBAND} (Maximal Bandwidth). In this paper we present a complete formulation of the problem that includes explicit constraints to model the movement of traffic along the streets between the intersections in a time-expanded network, as well as constraints to capture the permitted movements from modern signal controllers. The platoon dispersion model used is the well-known Robertson's model, which forms linear constraints. Thus it is a rare example of a traffic simulation being analytically embedded in an optimization formulation. The formulation is an integer-linear program, and does not assume fixed cycle lengths or phase sequences. It assumes full information on external inputs, but can be incorporated in a sensor-based environment, as well as in a feedback control framework. The formulation is an integer-linear program that may not be efficiently solved with standard simplex and branch and bound techniques. We discuss network programming formulations to handle the linear platoon dispersion equations and the integer constraints at the intersections. A special-purpose network simplex algorithm for fast solution is also mentioned.

AB  - This article presents a model and a procedure for determining traffic assignment and optimizing signal timings in saturated road networks. Both queuing and congestion are explicitly taken into account in predicting equilibrium flows and setting signal split parameters for a fixed pattern of origin-to-destination trip demand. The model is formulated as a bilevel programming problem. The lower-level problem represents a network equilibrium model involving queuing explicitly on saturated links, which predicts how drivers will react to any given signal control pattern. The upper-level problem is to determine signal splits to optimize a system objective function, taking account of drivers' route choice behavior in response to signal split changes. Sensitivity analysis is implemented for the queuing network equilibrium problem to obtain the derivatives of equilibrium link flows and equilibrium queuing delays with respect to signal splits. The derivative information is then used to develop a gradient descent algorithm to solve the proposed bilevel traffic signal control problem. A numerical example is included to demonstrate the potential application of the assignment model and signal optimization procedure.

This study selects the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe traffic flow characteristics and design an optimal control model using one kind of network throughput performance indices, system dispersal time, as the control objective. Signal timing plans are calculated by gene algorithm optimization with single cycle strategy (SCS) and double cycle strategy (DCS) respectively. Results show that a proper non-maximum cycle length will disperse congested network vehicles rapidly and fixed double cycle strategy is feasible in oversaturated network traffic control especially with higher priority in artery

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - In this paper, a dynamic system-optimal traffic assignment model is formulated as a convex control problem for a congested general network with many origins and many destinations. Analytical and computational difficulties caused by the nonconvexity of the previous models are eliminated. The modeling of arc traffic dynamics is improved to prohibit instantaneous flow propagation on each arc even though the concave exit functions are still employed to represent the physical process of traffic congestion. An economic interpretation of the optimality conditions is given as a dynamic assignment principle which requires equilibration of actual marginal costs on all the paths that are used. A numerical example is also presented.

AB  - The study on the model of traffic flow is one of the research hotshots in computer network. Employing fractal theory, we set up a mathematical model of traffic flow whose properties depending on the parameters like the ratio distribution of the traffic flow and corresponding time intervals. The self-similar or multifractal traffic can be simulated when the parameters are in different certain ranges. Furthermore, some numerical experiments are shown in this paper to verify the effectiveness of the traffic mathematical model.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of transportation energy consumption constraints in the organization of an urban system, and the relative allocation of its land use activities, through the use of a combined land use transportation model based on a modification of TOPAZ. In addition to the formulation of the mathematical structure of the model, the paper reports on the development of the solution algorithm, and some preliminary tests indicating rapid model convergence and minimal computational costs. These tests also reveal that transportation energy cost is an important variable in determining metropolitan structure and the location of urban activities.

AB  - This paper proposes an equilibrium system model for analyzing urban traffic congestion problems. According to the traffic equilibrium theory, each link on the traffic network has an optimal capacity to achieve equilibrium, with matching grade and settings. Traffic congestion occurs when capacity appears to decrease, when the road's capacity is less than the traffic demands. In order to find out all the congestion links on the network, a hierarchical model is established according to the network structure and road category scale; it includes the main roads and the branches. Comparing the road's optimal matching capacity and the real capacity, we computed the difference. For each link, if the optimal matching capacity was greater than the real capacity, it would need to be widened or reconstructed. For the whole network, the matching degree reflects the compatibility of the road supply and transportation demand. The traffic congestion diagnostic process should encompass the whole network down to a partial road; the bottlenecks would be a indicated by point, a line, or even an area, where congestion occurs. In the paper, we discuss the measurement of the congestion, the congestion degree on the link and the matching degree of the network. The congestion degree shows the severity of the problem, while the matching degree explains the efficiency of the network. This model describes the conflict between road supply and transportation demand, from macrocosm to microcosm. It, moreover, finds the discrepancy in the road network, and gives some reference for the urban transportation infrastructure construction and planning. Â© ASCE.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

AB  - The rapid growth of international container handling in recent years has led to an increased utilization of mega-containerships and the rebuild of container network. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - In USA, traffic simulation was originally developed to evaluate the traffic signal control system in the 1970s by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This paper first introduces the traffic signal control system software development process developed at Traffic Research Laboratory, in which traffic simulation is integrated to develop, debug, test and evaluate traffic signal control system software. The topics related to traffic simulation software and the interface between traffic simulation and traffic signal control devices are discussed. Next, those key roles are demonstrated in five prototype developments under FHWA's Adaptive Control System programs. Finally, the future activities in this area, including FHWA's Next Generation of Simulation program, the ACS-Lite program, the National Transportation Communications for ITS Protocol compliant interface in CORSIM, and the possibilities of creating a benchmark test network and CORSIM application server are discussed.

AB  - Cameras enable synthesis of disaggregated vehicle information from multiple locations. This paper addresses the problem of how to determine the optimal locations of cameras for best traffic surveillance in urban road networks. All users are divided into multiple classes according to their own acceptance degree of camera monitoring (ADOCM). A bi-level programming model for camera location problem (CLP) is introduced. The objective of upper level problem is to maximize the total observed traffic flow from the viewpoint of network planners. The lower level problem is to depict the logit-based stochastic route choice behavior of users. The method of successive averages (MSA) and Frank Wolfe algorithm are employed to solve the problem. Numerical examples show the managerial insight that the behavior against camera monitoring has brought considerable loss to network traffic surveillance.

AB  - This paper describes NETVACl, a model for simulating the traffic pattern during an emergency evacuation. The development of the model has been motivated by the need to estimate network clearance time for areas surrounding nuclear power plant sites, and the model has been applied in this context. {NETVACl} is a macro traffic simulation model sensitive to network topology, intersection design and control, and a wide array of evacuation management strategies. The model can handle large networks at modest computational costs and includes many reporting options. The paper includes a review of other approaches used to model evacuations and estimate network clearance times, a description of the structure and logic of the model and some computational experience.

AB  - Incident-induced traffic congestion is a critical issue in formulation urban traffic congestion problems. This paper presents a method which serves to alleviate incident-induced traffic congestion for urban traffic network. The proposed approach includes two major parts: models and optimal control algorithm. Based on the typical phase types in Chinese cities, calculation models for controlled flow at intersection exit lanes, for movement offsets, for delay and queue of each movement, and for delay and queue of links adjacent to incident location were formulated respectively. Movement was the basic unit when delay and queue were calculated. Then a real-code genetic algorithm was presented to implement the optimal control under incident condition, in which we used a penalty function to ensure constraints. In the preliminary test, eight optimization strategies were chosen for the network control. The result showed that the total delay could decrease approximately 20% even if no vehicle diversion was considered under incident condition.
