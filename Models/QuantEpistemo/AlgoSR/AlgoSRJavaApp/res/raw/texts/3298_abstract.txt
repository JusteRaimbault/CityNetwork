This paper presents an approach of potential groundwater capture of Piton de la Fournaise volcano in the Reunion Island (France - Indian Ocean). Different methods exist to capture groundwater resources. To further the traditional method of vertical wells, the horizontal wells could also used as volcanic structure is well adapted to them. But, at the Reunion island, there is no example of a horizontal well because of the doubt existing on the horizontal distance of the aquifer. The method developed in this study is therefore original because it gives a way to calculate this distance for the entire massif. In this article, the method to calculate vertical and horizontal accessibilities in a relational database is explained. Unfortunately, the result coverage gives data on the accessibility. It is therefore necessary to define criteria to select the most productive areas. The results of this study demonstrated that it is possible to calculate the vertical and horizontal accessibilities on the whole massif in coupling hydrogeologic modeling and GIS.
