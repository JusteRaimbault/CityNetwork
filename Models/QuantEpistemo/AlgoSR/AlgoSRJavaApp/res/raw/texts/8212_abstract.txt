An approach of self-adapting morphological segmentation using new type of images associated to segmentation enables the exploitation of the extracted data, in order to collect, to model and to homogenize them within descriptors. The use of this information available on the objects relies on spatial relationships, among others, in order to describe the relations between the objects, and their characteristics. It is the modeling and the generation of descriptors which makes original this approach in the context of processing remote sensing images.
