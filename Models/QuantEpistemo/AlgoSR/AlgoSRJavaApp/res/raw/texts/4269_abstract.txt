According to the classification of S.Rokkan, four cleveages have generated political parties in democraties : church/secular, center/periphery, owners/workers and rural/urban cleveages. The rural/urban cleveage is the most recent and has produced fewer parties than the other divisions. Nevertheless, the growth of green parties is sometimes associated to electoral urban structuration and we can suppose that the apparition of a agrarian party in France («Chasse, Pêche, Nature et Tradition») is related to a rural structuration. To test the hypothesis of the influence of urbanisation on the localisation of «les Verts» and «CNPT», we’ll use spatial analysis methodology at two different scales : France by «canton» and Basse-Normandie by «commune». Our goal is to illustrate the actual electoral realignement in the occidental democraties (both decline of the great parties and the class vote, relative decrease of the «left wing/right wing» cleveage, votes on particular stakes) and to demonstrate that this changes are produced by new spatial patterns.
