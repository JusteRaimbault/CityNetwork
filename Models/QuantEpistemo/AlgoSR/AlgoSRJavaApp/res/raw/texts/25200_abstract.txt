Drawing its methodology both from literary geography and cultural history, the present article studies a specific place – Litang (Kham) – through the explorers’ narratives, taking into account geographical and cultural determinations as well as the in situ encounter. In other words, here and there, past and present are the criteria that enable to read the narrated experience of the explorers fully. How do they give shape to Litang, a Tibetan town on the road from Beijing to Lhasa they are the first to visit? What kind of relationship with the place of the other do they develop? To what interaction does their encounter lead? The way they describe a place that had never been seen before them suggests reflections on the introduction of a foreign place into Western geographical consciousness and on the multiple patterns of our toposensibility.
