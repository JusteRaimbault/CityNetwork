The economic geography of greater Paris has experienced important changes in the last 25 years. The increase in both services and high-tech jobs has obviously had consequences on the employment location. Such changes might affect the way data and statistics help to understand the region. They might not be as accurate in the end of the period as they were at the beginning. Hence the data that were available between 1975 and 1990 seemed to reveal a dramatic evolution for the eastern part of the urban area. A new analysis made on the same data but coded in a different way (thanks to a new nomenclature) tends to tell another story. Both eastern and western parts have evolved, but the former data were able to reveal only a part of the changes. And that part concerned mostly the jobs concentrated in the western part. So it missed the changes of the east.
