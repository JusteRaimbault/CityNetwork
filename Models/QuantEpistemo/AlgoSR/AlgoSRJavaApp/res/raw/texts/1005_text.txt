Introduction
The European colloquia on theoretical and quantitative geography are held every two years in a different country. After a 1999 session in Durham, the 2001 meeting took place in Saint-Valery-en-Caux (Normandy), and the next meeting will be organized in 2003 near Pisa by Silvana Lombardo (s.lombardo@ing.unipi.it).
These meetings are concerned with recent advances in the areas of theoretical and quantitative research, and , as so, they may be considered as the searching head in the methodological field of the discipline. 122 searchers attended the 2001 colloquium, and 75 papers have been presented, covering a large range of thematic aspects. Unlike most of the geographical congresses, traditional presentations of themes or regions must not be expected here, the main concern being the search for new tools, new methods, new problematical and theoretical improvements.
After an outlook on the general perspectives on the research agenda, by Denise Pumain, and an exploration on the practices and objectives of models in geography, by Roger Brunet, several papers deal, of course, with theories, models and spatial analysis. A lot of technical papers deal with statistical and mathematical models , space-time processes or GIS and remote sensing. But this 2001 session of the European Colloquium was concerned by a specific involvement in fractal analysis and cellular automata models.
The thematic applications of these new methods applied mainly to environment, pollution and risks, geography and health, transportation networks, amenities and consumption, and urban models.
The proceedings published in Cybergeo are limited to the papers revised by the authors for publication, and submitted, as the other papers of the journal, to the advice and modifications of two referees. As such they may be considered as a valuable outlook on the level of the geographical methods at the dawn of the 21th century.
