Photographic samplings representative of a space and recorded in an image databases now give us access to a new set of information on the landscape (landscape architecture, atmosphere, colours...). The presented example is based on a survey that allows us to characterise landscapes in an objective manner, as seen from two different projected itineraries heading towards Santiago de Compostela from Franche-Comté. The point was to put ourselves in the position of future users by taking pictures of the landscape as it will be displayed. and thus viewed by the person walking towards Santiago. It also is to apprehend landscape variations that give a pace to the walk, making it pleasant or tedious. A typology of the encountered landscapes is being produced based on an analysis of the pictures, processed three at a time. Image banks and GIS tools then allow us to visualise landscapes as they are perceived all along the paths. A representation by histogram does facilitates the visual distinction of different types and make easier to assess landscape variations or "rhythms". The fact of taking into account the perception processes of the users of a space shows how landscape will appear strongly diversified – in a linear approach – by the rhythms of the walk. This way we can link space, mobility and temporality.
