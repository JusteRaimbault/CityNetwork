Ecological network concept is a growing core element of conservation strategies. Based on the need to integrate ecological processes which underlie spatial dynamics of biodiversity at a landscape scale, network planning is largely based on a single model that allows the identification of natural core areas and linkage corridors. In this context a structural mapping approach is the most often used means to discuss and identify conservation issues at stake and to prepare recommendations for action. In this paper we analyze the process of ecological network construction at the scale of a Regional Natural Park in southern France. We show that by sticking to a classical and highly technical approach focused on mapping spatial organization, the group of actors involved was unable to produce neither a collective representation of the conservation stakes nor recommend a plan of actions. Our study highlights the need to integrate more correctly the ordinary biodiversity of the landscape matrix and consider that a mapping approach should above all make possible the construction and functioning of a social interaction process.
