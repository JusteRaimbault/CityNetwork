According to different approaches in social sciences, the notions of water and territories change when one shifts from « resource » water to «network» water. This bi-polar approach has been overcome by a new environmental model. After a resource « naturalistic » approach « the hydraulic territory », studies on water follow two different lines : one looks specially at the territories scale  shaping (the water shed) while the other stresses the inequalities of water distribution (social geography modelling). In contrast, in relation to territories, the network approach encompasses water as a public utility. It focuses on administrative and concession territories, as well as on technical matters – connected/non connected areas. Then in between, a different model of analysis appears based on environmental sciences and sustainable development. This approach is based upon the cycle of water. The urban territory is gradually replaced by an integrated system including man and nature.
