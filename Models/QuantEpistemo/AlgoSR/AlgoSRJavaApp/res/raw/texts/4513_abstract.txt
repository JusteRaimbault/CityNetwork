In the Aegean sea, in the Greek archipelago of the Dodecanese, the small island of Psérimos welcomes every day between May and October, hundreds of trippers who have come there in order to enjoy the beach and the supposed authenticity of the place. These visitors, mostly foreigners, are staying in the neighbouring islands of Kalymnos or Kos which Psérimos has become a kind of tourist hinterland. This phenomenon resulting in substantial profits, helps to keep on the spot a local population which is getting more and more involved in and sensitive to the need to preserve a good quality environment. However, the persons involved are taking part into a harsh competition which might be detrimental to the development of that very activity. Such a situation implies outside interference and decisions stating clearing the rules of the game.
