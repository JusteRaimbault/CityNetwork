This paper aims at showing the usefulness of the optimal location-allocation models for planning health care facilities in a developing country. Â Several simulations are performed for one province of Rwanda (Kibungo) leading to quite interesting conclusions in terms of planning as well as operationality of the model. The outcomes of two planning hypotheses are evaluated: (i) massive changes in the location of population, and (ii) changes in the transportation conditions by an enhancement of the road network.
