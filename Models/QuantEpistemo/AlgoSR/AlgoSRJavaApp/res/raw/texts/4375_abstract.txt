The Chinese Overseas form what one estimates to be the world's wealthiest diaspora. They progressively settled throughout the world for more than fifteen centuries, a migratory phenomenon still unmatched. The causes of this exodus, for exodus applies if one speaks about diaspora, plunge in the history of ancient China and the major values of its civilization. Confucianism and Chinese strategy contributed very strongly to form what some now call a "global tribe" whose assets could even exceed those of the People's Republic of China itself.
