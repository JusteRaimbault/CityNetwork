The relationship between space, power and identity has to be mediated by symbols. A symbol is a concrete reality (a building, a statue, a coin, etc.) that communicates something intangible (an idea, a value, a feeling...): consequently, a place of power would be necessarily a symbolic place, which brings the power in the space order and the space in the power order. The symbolic mediations between these different orders of reality are produced and interpreted only in their context of emergence. A place can be considered as “symbolic” whenever it means something to a group of individuals, in such a way that it contributes to give an identity to the group. With examples taken throughout the Americas, this paper investigates how symbolic places are produced and controlled by public authorities, civil societies and economic actors.
