The French Polmar-Terre contingency plans aim at organizing the action of Governemental services in the event of a major marine pollution affecting the French coasts. Set up by the Departement Prefect, such plans contain a marine pollution sensitivity atlas, i.e. an operational document that states and prioritize the geomorphological, ecological and socio-economical stakes of the departemental coastal zone. This paper  presents an updated version of the Polmar-Terre atlas of the Département de la Manche, that have been ordered to GEOMER by the Basse-Normandie Regional Direction of the Environment and the MIMEL. The method used to produce the atlas, especially regarding the built up of the sensitivity indexes and their mapping, is presented to feed the current discussion about the national standardization of Polmar-Terre atlases. According to the recommendations of the Polmar-Terre Revision Guide of CEDRE, this work is based on the development of an interservices GIS. Its implementation constraints and its current and future stakes are discussed in the frame of the MIMEL’s Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure purposes.
