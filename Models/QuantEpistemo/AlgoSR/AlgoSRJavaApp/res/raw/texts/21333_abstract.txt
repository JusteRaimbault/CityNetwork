This paper argues for the interest of GIS for economic appraisal of transport policy. In a first part the article shows that gravity accessibility indicators are consistent with the surplus theory. Then gravity accessibility calculations are performed on a case study of the Strasbourg area. These calculations underline the possibility to take into account both the population heterogeneity with a partly disaggregated analysis, and the heterogeneity of transport supply through a detailed zonal approach, with an appropriate GIS. The results underline that GIS are relevant tools for public decision making.
