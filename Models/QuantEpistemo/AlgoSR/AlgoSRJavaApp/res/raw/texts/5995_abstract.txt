After pointing out the difficulty of assessment of the risks linked with the transport of dangerous goods (TDG), a method of vulnerability assessment is proposed. This method is based on some mathematical techniques allowing to take into account subjective judgements of experts in order to formalise complex problemsÂ : multicriteria decision help methods and fuzzy logic. The practical application of this method requires the use of a geographical information system. A tool destined to prepare interventions is then proposed and the simulation of an accident allows the efficiency of vulnerability maps to be tested.
