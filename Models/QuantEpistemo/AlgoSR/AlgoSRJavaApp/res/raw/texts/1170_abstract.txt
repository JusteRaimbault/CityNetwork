Since the beginning of the 90s, different French cities and regions have been organised to host film shooting teams. In a way to help them to choose the different film settings, the city is "cut" by the local authorities into "selected pieces", presented on different materials (Books, CD-ROMs, SIG, etc.). Our hypothesis is double : first, these materials both create and communicate a new idea of urban aesthetics, which does not obey to the classical aesthetic codes of current urban communication materials. These are not the "aesthetics of conformity" of the urban marketing brochures or materials, but "anti-aesthetics" exploiting any different, trouble, or original element. Second, local authorities tend to exploit these cinematographic aesthetics : they thus try to show the city as it has been caught by the camera. "Cinema eye" gives an added value to places which had not an a priori recognised aesthetic quality. We speak about the "city as a setting" because we thing that the different initiatives taken by the local authorities in a way to attract film shooting tend to transform the city into a gigantic setting. Material created in this occasion (brochures, books, CD-ROMs) "cut" the city into photographic sequences, which are characterised, legended, commented. In a context in which, thanks to television, cinema, internet, urban experience tends to be less and less real, and more and more virtual, the question of the creation of urban image and aesthetics by the cinema becomes extremely important.
