Since several decades, French urbanisation evolves in a way that can hardly be seen favourable to public transportation. Innovation is needed in this field, if the individual automobile is to be faced on its own territories. This need for innovation concerns the miscellaneous stages of the public transport production, including the preliminary analysis ones. Indeed, many work remains to be done to understand mobility behaviour, what is more if we are to propose versatile and viable alternatives to current trends. Geomarketing based surveys, combining revealed and stated preferences, are a powerful way of acquiring such an accurate information. From a qualitative point of view, this kind of information allows to calibrate public transport services adapted as much as possible to the targeted customers. However, the major problem of the spatial generalisation of this individual information remains often unsolved. In this context, a strategy is proposed, based on the combination of miscellaneous methods.
