In 2003 dramatic forest fires in Var department renewed the French government interest for fire hazards. This resulted in an acceleration of the implementation of forest fire risks prevention plans (PPRIF) in all French Mediterranean regions. In the Pyrénées-Orientales has been established a particularly aggressive policy towards urbanization in woodland. This case reveals complex issues: economic, political, environmental... For people living in woodland-urban interface, the result of PPRIF is an inflation of new technical and financial constraints which are difficult to accept: while public authorities have supported the protection cost against forest fires for about forty years, it is gradually transferred to house owners. This case confirms the conflictuality of risks management in France and the weak consideration of vulnerability in risk assessment.
