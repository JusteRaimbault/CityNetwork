The tsunami that affected the Indian oceanâ€™s rims on December 26, 2004 claimed close to 226 000 deaths, essentially on the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, which suffered overwhelming devastation.

In addition, other alternatives including land use planning and education focused on tsunami risk management are presented. Their application could strongly reduce financial and human losses if such hazard had to occur again.
