Naplesâ€™ botanical garden (Real Orto Botanico) serves here as a case-study to analyse the functions of distance at a micro scale level in a space devoted to presenting and organizing nature. My main hypothesis is that knowledge and symbols shapping the garden are experienced through the very material aspects of distance. How can distance make categories real?
