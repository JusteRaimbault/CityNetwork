Agricultural practices and their evolution play a key role on land use and environmental ecosystem change. Environmental studies have showed the importance of landscape structure element composition and spatial arrangement to maintain the agricultural landscape multifunctionality. Two of these elements were analyzed in this study: parcels, in analyzing crop rotation; and hedgerows by their physiognomy and continuity in the landscape. The two elements, parcels and hedgerows, had been put together in order to analyze the hedgerow spatial arrangement (continuity type) according to the land cover spatial dynamic (crop rotation) in their neighborhood. Results highlight a general spatial logic as densest hedgerows are concentrated within grassland parcel groups, while narrowest are border by more intensive parcels, i.e. always or predominantly in crop. However, results have also showed that landscape type influence the structure of landscape patterns: in case of opening landscapes, hedgerow network is indifferently bordered by crops or grassland parcels; associated agricultural practices for the management of this hedgerows are fundamentally different.
