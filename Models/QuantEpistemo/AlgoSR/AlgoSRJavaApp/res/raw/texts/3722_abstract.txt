The purpose of this article is to briefly describe the recent advances in the graphs theory using the concept of the minimal spanning tree in geomorphometric terms. The description of the distribution of a grouping of nodes in geographical space can be realised mathematically, giving rise to eleven distinct morphometric classes. These classifications constitute the basic spatial models from which it is possible to measure the rate of disorder, which is the deviation from the model. Other constructs than that of order/disorder in spatial organisation are also analysed. With a spatial quantification table, one is able to observe in a single table the models important to the space being analysed and their different rates of disorder.
