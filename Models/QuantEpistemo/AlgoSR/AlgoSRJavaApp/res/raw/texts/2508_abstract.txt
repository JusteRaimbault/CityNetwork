From the Middle Ages, irrigation canals are constructed in different places of the Alps mountains. These networks were needed by the dryness of the climate. Their numbers  evolved over periods of a few decade  depending of demographic requirements. We are looking for the spatial distribution of these canals to characterize a fractal geometry. This approach  is close to the one developed by urbanists to study the communication networks in and around cities. The distribution of the land surfaces must be characterized in the same way to check the good matching against the irrigation networks.
