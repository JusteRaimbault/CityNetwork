The climatic criterion impacts the behaviour and the decision of individuals and social groups; thus, it is a major component of the territory life. Therefore, dividing space according to different climate types is worth to be achieved by using updated data processing resources. With this aim in view, the authors suggest a spatial approach for defining climates and their geographical limits. Taking into account measurements made by Météo-France recording stations, a data set related to temperature and precipitation is worked out for a 30 years period (1971-2000), it includes 14 variables able to characterize the climates and their specific variability. An original method, so called Local interpolation, allows to represent each of the 14 variables as a continuous field and to store them in the form of GIS data layers. These data are then processed by coupling Correspondence Analysis and Ascending Hierarchical Classification in order to obtain a typology where 8 climates are identified and mapped on the French continental territory. An additional process using a probabilistic method enables to map the potential distribution space of each climate and to shade the strict type delimitation such as it is given by classification. A final synthesis leads to interpret the obtained results within the frame of a general climate understanding. Two annexes enable to download the cartographic documentation related to this paper.
