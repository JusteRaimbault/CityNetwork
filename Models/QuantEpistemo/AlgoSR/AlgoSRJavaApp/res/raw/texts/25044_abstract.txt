This paper examines the impact of urban forms on sonic perceptions in three public spaces in Grenoble: the Tilleuls square in the old center, the Mistral-Eaux-Claires square in the Eaux-Claires district, and the Centrale square on the U-campus. Both related to several disciplines, ambiance and public space are two notions that refer to experience, and thus to a place’s perception. Among this place’s determinants, the urban form is a current assessment indicator. This study is based on both quantitative and qualitative data. It aims to assess interactions between urban representations and soundscapes.
