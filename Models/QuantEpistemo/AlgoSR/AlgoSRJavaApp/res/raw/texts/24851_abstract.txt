This research aims at taking into account the mutations of the various zonings that are used to collect statistical data. The focus is on the conception of a model that handles the mutations of units that are composing those zonings, based on the building of the unitsâ€™ genealogy. An automation of the update process of such a model is highly desirable, integrating the zoning versions as they come. The identity of each unit and its life are at the core of the model, which uses events to index changes of those units. The update process uses an algorithm which detects events based on geometrical constraints, and units are matched by means of a belief function that combines the various criteria defining the identity of a unit through out time. The expert can use a dedicated interface in order to control and analyse the results, and integrate its own knowledge on the history of the considered territories.
