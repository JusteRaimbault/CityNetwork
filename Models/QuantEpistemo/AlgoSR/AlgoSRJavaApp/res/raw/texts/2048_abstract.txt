A survey was carried out among twenty professionals playing a role in the land management to understand better the social representations of the Swiss Jura landscape. In order to let the interviewees freely express their conception of landscape, it was decided not to use any type of graphical support but to ask only open questions. Some elements of a definition found in the answers shed light on the theoretical bases of landscape assessment. The results showed different levels of perception. A visual approach focusing on the relationship between relief and land-use appears as a fundamental topic. On more analytical grounds, the importance attached to the economic, sociocultural and environmental stakes determines the basis of the value judgement. These findings allowed landscape representation models to be drawn from the intervieweesâ€™ points of view, explaining how the landscape is conceived and what criteria are considered relevant for assessing it in the social groups. The next step will be to further define quantitative as well as qualitative indicators to be integrated in a methodology for diagnosing landscape using Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
