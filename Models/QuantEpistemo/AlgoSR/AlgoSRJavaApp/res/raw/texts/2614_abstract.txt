Since the last twenty years, natural hazard have taken an important place in our mind and in the media. Considered in the pastas the manifestation of the divine's anger and of the fatality, scientist progress has brought us to a rationalization of the way of thinking, making us less tolerant with natural hazard. If many studies have been made in a frame of the characterisation of the physical process that bring to natural hazard, few studies have been made in a frame of the a global estimation of the exposition of each country to natural hazard using two approaches of the vulnerability. The aim of our paper is to present a comparative study of the estimation of the risk exposure of each country, combining two approaches of the vulnerability (social and economic) with a probabilistic approach of the hazard. This work highlights the fact that using a social approach of the vulnerability, we can observe a great inequality between "rich" countries and "poor" countries that present a high level of exposure to risk while using an economical approach of the vulnerability, "rich" countries present the highest level of exposure to risk.
