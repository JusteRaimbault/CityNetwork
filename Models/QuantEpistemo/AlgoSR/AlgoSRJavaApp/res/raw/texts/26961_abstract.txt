This paper explores, using a Agent-based model approach (ABM), the conditions for the emergence and the structuration of quality wine’s historical areas as described in the work of Roger Dion, particularly in his article entitled “Querelles des anciens et des modernes sur les facteurs de la qualité du vin” written in 1952 (Dion, 1952).
