This article aims at synthesising the literature on migrants’ health, considering the different political levels that impact on it, and to analyse the various actions turned towards migrants’ health in two different settings, in France (Rennes and Poitiers). The article highlights the functioning of the local structures aiming at taking care of new migrants. In this article, I underline the importance of adjustments made by local policies to propose and compose structures appropriated to healthcare and social care for new migrants as well as migrants leaving in the city for longer, including questions on migrants associations’ role in such context.
