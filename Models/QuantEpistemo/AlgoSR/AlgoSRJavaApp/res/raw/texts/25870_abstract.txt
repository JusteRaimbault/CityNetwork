This article presents the discourse of the XXth century French geography about the American cities. This discourse evolves according to urban reality in the United States, but also according to French political context, to images and knowledge that exist within French medias (university books, press, literature, movies, TV shows, etc.). The way American cities are depicted in French geography textbooks of the XXth century reflects the way French society considers its own cities at this period.
