Based on my own memories, a number of interviews and personal discussions, I will present an overview of the work of Raymond Guglielmo, Bernard Kayser, Yves Lacoste, Andr√© Prenant, Michel Rochefort and Raymond Dugrand who were all born between 1923 and 1927. They were all former members of the French Communist Party and have all been instrumental in shaping French Geography after WWII and the emergence of various fields such as regional planning, urban studies, and the so called Third World geography after the decolonization era.
