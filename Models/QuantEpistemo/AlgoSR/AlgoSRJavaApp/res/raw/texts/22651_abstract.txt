The aim of this paper is to define “eco-frontiers,” both theoretically and methodologically. Our argument is illustrated and detailed by examples taken in South Africa (Wild Coast). “Eco-frontier” is a tri-dimensional idea. Firstly, it is an existing notion, normalised, used and instrumentalised by groups of stakeholders like environmental NGOs. Secondly, it a psycho-mental and spatial representation conveyed by a westernised imaginary of nature. Finally, eco-frontier is also a spatial category that can be understood through different parameters. Transversally, eco-frontiers are real or mental spaces marked by strong ecological and aesthetic values which are coveted by various stakeholders. Many types of ecological appropriations imply different conflicting categories of eco-frontiers: e.g., wilderness, landscape, and extractive use. Eco-frontiers are transitory and temporary spaces characterised by specific geographical parameters: a pioneer gateway opened to an isolated and low population density area, weakly bounded by unattainable limits; an ecological appropriation done virtually or physically by groups of eco-settlers; and a group of local inhabitants offering mixed reactions. Eco-frontiers create very complex situation for stakeholders disputing different legitimacies based on different uses of ecosystems, resources, or land. Winning ecological appropriations tends to shape new spatial patterns: e.g., conservation enclave, urban sprawl (tourism activity or peri-urbanisation), or wasteland. The South African example (the Xolobeni area, Wild Coast) illustrates a “wilderness versus extractive” eco-frontier with a detailed focus on environmental NGOs. This example is used to understand what are the different categories of eco-settlers which can be generalised.
