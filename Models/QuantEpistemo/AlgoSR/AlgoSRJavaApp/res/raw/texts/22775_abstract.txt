The health of the population of Vientiane, the main city in Lao PDR, was assessed by means of a health examination performed in 2000 adults in 2006. The examination focused on chronic diseases (diabetes and hypertension), overweight, deficiency disease (anaemia) and infectious disease (past exposure to flavivirus). These biomedical data were related to the residential neighbourhood. Spatial health disparities can then be observed within the small city of Vientiane: they are closely associated with the level of urbanization of the “villages” (villages are administrative units which constitute the main spatial reference frame for lao people). Multilevel logistic regression models are used to identify the factors responsible for these spatial health disparities. After taking into account their individual characteristics, residents in the more urbanized areas are more affected by diabetes, overweight and obesity, more exposed to flavivirus and less affected by anaemia than those of less urbanized areas. However, the influence that the area of residence has on health should not be regarded as operative in the same manner in all residents in Vientiane: cross-level interactions show that this influence varies according to sex, age and standard of living of Vientiane population. This study therefore underscores the influence of the area of residence on health, but it does not yield to a geographical determinism.
