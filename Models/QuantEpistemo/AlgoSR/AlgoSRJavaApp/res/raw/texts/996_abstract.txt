As the land use -and the density - is a predominant factor to determine the level of risks, the european and national laws plan to limit the land uses around dangerous industrial plants, like fuel oil storages. In urban areas, it leads to reduce the construction possibilities ; that is why planners sometimes proposed to remove those embarrassing industries. But then, they don’t take into account that the flows of dangerous substances may grow and increase transport-risks. With the help of a GIS where land use is precisely discribed, a method is developped to compare risks around a dangerous plant and risks relevant to the dangerous flows to and from that plant. It is based on the calculation of damages within the areas potentially touched by the consequences of an accident. The GIS is very useful to count these damages at a regional scale (where dangerous substances are delivered) and to compare the risks for various simulated locations of a plant in order to check the pertinence of the planners propositions of removal. The case of fuel oil storage and road trafic has been chosen, as they take place in a large urban area, the region of Ile - de-France for our example.
