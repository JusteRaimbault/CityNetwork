The majority of African savannas are each year traversed by fires for the benefit of hunting and agropastoral activities. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the contribution of Landsat imagery to the definition and the discretization of the zones affected by seasonal fires. The methodology used consists of three modes of treatment, namely the algorithm of detection of burned surfaces worked out by Eva and Lambin (1998), the unsupervised isodata classification realized on the thermal infra-red channel and the supervised classification by maximum likelihood carried out on optimized three-colour processes combining channels 6.1, 5 and 6.2. The treatments made it possible to highlight the areas affected by recent and old fires, the unburned forests and savannas. The method of thresholding of Lambin and Eva and the supervised classification give rather concordant results in quantitative terms as well as space covered. These two methods indicate that respective percentages of 28,25 and 27,9 of the total surface were affected by fires (old and recent). Automatic classification reduced the proportion of the territory affected by fires to 18%. This undervaluation of fires is related to the maladjustment of this last method to effectively discriminate the surfaces affected by relatively old or not very virulent fires and underlines the need for a joint use of channels 5 and 6 in the discretization of the burned surfaces. The distribution of the surface areas by type of vegetation indicates that 36% of shrub savannas, 23% of tree savannas, 7% of degraded forests and 0,4% of humid dense forests were burned at this period which corresponds just to the middle of the dry season in the study area. These experiments must however be taken again on other sites and at other periods of the year to better appreciate the contribution of the Landsat system in the study of vegetation fires in the Cameroonian territory.
