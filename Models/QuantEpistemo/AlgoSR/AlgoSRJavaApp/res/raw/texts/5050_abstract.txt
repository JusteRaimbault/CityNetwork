About landscape modelling and simulations, the use of a digital elevation model is absolutely necessary. However, the purchase of such a model is not always possible for the expected localization and precision. We developed a very simple software allowing to build digital elevation models from altitude measurements taken on the terrain. The aim of this article is to describe the GenMNT software freely distributed on the Cybergeo web site. The user's manual comes with a quick and non-exhaustive presentation of the main methods of interpolation. The running of our program (based on the Delaunay triangulation) is described step by step. Lastly, we insist on the software simplicity and its interfacing with the Vistaproïƒ¤ software to produce landscape 3D realistic views.
