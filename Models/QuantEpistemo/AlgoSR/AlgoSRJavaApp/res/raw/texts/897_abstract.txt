The subject of this study is the interrelationship between household formation and changes in the housing market. Young people's possibilities to move from their parental home are especially focused upon. These possibilities are dependent upon a number of processes in the housing market, such as production of new dwellings or the actions of other households. This means in turn that the situation of young people is treated as a part of a much larger and complex system of interaction in a local housing market. The primary thesis of the study is that interaction between individuals and structure is of crucial importance. The development of a method to describe complex interactions is an important part of the study. In order to describe many simultaneous processes on the individual level, in time and space, a micro-simulation model has been constructed. The model provides a good picture of the moves of young people and how their possibilities are restricted by both their own situation and structural conditions.
