The separation between residential and activity places is used to produce functionnal zoning such as " urban areas " or " employment areas ". Commuting and shopping trips reveal an increasing jobs, shops and services’ concentration in urban places and a large residential spreading around them. This study tries to replace interurban trips in different space categories (like urban or rural categories) by looking for the way differents grounds can be associated during a whole sequence. The main hypothesis is the existence of major trips generators (like working) relied to a number of secondary grounds (like shops or services). The main statistical source used is the Enquête Transports - Communications INRETS / INSEE 1993-1994 paired with datas from Population Census and Communal Inventory.
