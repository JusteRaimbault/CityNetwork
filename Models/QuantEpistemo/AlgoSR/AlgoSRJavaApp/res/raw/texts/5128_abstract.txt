All of our travelling is constrained by the structure of the transportation network. Furthermore, due to differences in their performance (incomplete spatial coverage, variations in the velocity of change), these networks tend to make space non-homogeneous an non-isotropic, that is to say, non-Euclidian. Traditional geometry isthus proving to be more and more inadequate to model space as it is really experienced. Consequently, in order to take account of changes in the relationships between places induced by the networks, we are proposing to analyze their effects based on fractal geometry, which does not assume that space is homogeneous and therefore affords a framework reference different from that of our own environment. We intend to analyze, first, the impact of this network structure in terms of its spatial coverage, then we will attempt to observe how the quality of accessibility to a group of service supply areas is dependent upon the morphology and the operation of the network that links them.
