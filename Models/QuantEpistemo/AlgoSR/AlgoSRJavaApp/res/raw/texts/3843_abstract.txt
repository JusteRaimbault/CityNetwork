Since September 2002, new public curriculum put into effect in the elementary school. What's it about, a real change in teaching geography or a simple continuity of the previous public programs ? The purpose of this article is the study of the city in public programs in the last terms of elementary school. On the one hand, the city, as a teaching subject, as been a recurrent part of geographical teaching in the official government’s program, and this since 1887. On the other hand, a study of town brings to the students (who are tomorrow’s citizens) knowledge to understand their living spaces, to take a part in their transformation, at their level.   The history of public programs (from 1882 to nowadays) allowed to quantitatively reveal the topic of geography and its connection to the very organization of related concepts.
