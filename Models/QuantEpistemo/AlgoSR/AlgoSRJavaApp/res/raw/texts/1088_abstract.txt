The night activities in Nancy are very limited and mostly reduced to «leisures» of which the evolution is linked to technical factors such as the lighting´s control, to geographical factors such as the lighting´s distribution in the urban space or the perception of the seasonal obligations of the east climat, but also to sociological factors such as the life´s style or the social composition of the quarters. Today, the «festivals» let the place essentially to the individual leisures in specialized establishments for townspeople looking after «entertainment» when the night left the city to those for whom it becomes the place of phantasm of any kind. In front of an increasing demand for «leisure» and night´s lifespace, this city socially quite searchs for a conciliation between the night´s function of the city –the rest- and the limited night´s entertainment function while progressively the «night» shifts from the previous center (today transformed into a residential function more classical) to the periphery.
