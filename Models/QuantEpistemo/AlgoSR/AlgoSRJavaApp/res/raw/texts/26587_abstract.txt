The purpose of this article is the reflection on land use and occupancy approach after major disasters, using the case of Tabarre, community of the Haitian capital, affected by the earthquake on 12th of January 2010. This earthquake, as did other large-scale events, showed the key place of the soil for crisis management, while this issue is not often addressed. The analysis is based on cartography representing land-use changes in times of crises. We highlight different modification types, opening areas for further reflection on operational scope. We also consider the theoretical value concerning development logic and resilience of urban territories.
