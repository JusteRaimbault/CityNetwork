The geography of boardgames practises, which remains to be written, can not avoid a preliminary research on the games themselves and their inner logic. Within that framework, "traditionnal" boardgames have the interest of being possibly considered models of social reality and lend themselves to an investigation of a geographical nature. The study of the features of these play spaces – scale, metrics, substance – and of the nature of their relationship is a first step towards a typology of games, based on the representations of space conveyed by them. Such a typology is a crucial step towards the writing of a geography of practises.
