In this paper, an economic alternative to the standard, group-based viewpoint on segregation measurement is presented. Relying on Justice Theories, a description of an economic measure of inter-individual distance is provided, where emphasis is put on the utilitarian definition of well-being. In this framework, urban segregation could be appraised as the conjunction of geographical distance within the city and this economically-defined distance. Using fiscal data and the 2006 Population Census, an application is supplied for Île-de-France, in order to highlight the empirical discrepancies or complementarities of the standard and the economic conceptions of segregation. While no major discrepancies are observed, the economic point of view allows for a generalization of some of the standard approach results, and also provides additional evidence on segregation in Île-de-France.
