This paper presents the construction of a model aimed to interpret, from interviews and observations, the various practices of high-school geography teachers. A disciplinary model is composed of four distinct standards of finalities, conceptions of knowledge and geographical space and methods. These four standards allow us to have a better understanding the teacherâ€™s choices towards the contents and learning competences.
