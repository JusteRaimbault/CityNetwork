The construction of European graduate labour market, through increased international graduate mobility, cannot take place without it appearing beneficial for graduates. Indeed, all types of mobility have a cost, even if the latter is not always financial (leaving family, adapting to a new environment, etc.). Moreover, we can wonder whether graduates employment prospects actually improve thanks to international mobility. Using the Céreq « Génération 98 » survey, our first results show that international mobility on entering the labour market appears to be rare.  Finally, this experience abroad is also valued if the graduates re-enter the French labour market: the mobile graduates have more frequently jobs with high-levels of responsibility and earn more than those who stayed in France.
