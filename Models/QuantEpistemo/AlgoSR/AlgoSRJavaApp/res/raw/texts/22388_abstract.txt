The aim of this paper is about the trends of regional disparities in the European Union who can be considered as a complex system.. For modelling the uncertain efficiency of the regional policy we attempted to use a cellular automata (Geocells) developed by P.Langlois). Methodologically, this cellular automata Geocells is based on interrelated processes between variables (like time periods, growth rates in the GDP per head, flows of public investments) and three geographical levels (european level, national level and regional level). This three levels are used to lay the emphasis on the fact that the EU structural expenditure, and its spatial impact, work as a rules-based system. Simulations were made, in order to evaluate, on the one hand, the specific role of each level and each variable, and on the other hand how some change in one part affects the whole. In this perspective we could underline the role of increasing or decreasing budgets, the weigth of national policies and national economic trends and the contiguity effect according to the geographical location of each eligible region.
