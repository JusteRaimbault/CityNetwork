French urban law has been conceived as a framework for the urbanization of unused space. However, at present, its usefulness for the development of already urbanized areas is questioned. This is particularly true for the two main instruments of local planning, the Plan d’Occupation du Sol (POS) and the Zones d’Aménagement Concertés (ZAC). But the consequences of local urban planning on the real estate activity in the short and the long run are not well known. This study aims at analyzing how local urban policies - and in particular the rules of the POS and the ZAC - determine the change in urban texture. The research carried out is original in that it focusses on the urban transformation at the level of land lots by the means of a data base on building permissions. This instrument allows us to analyze the spatial dimension of the change in real estate activity quantitatively. It is used to study the urban transformation of two municipalities in the western Parisian outskirts - Issy-Les-Moulineaux and Boulogne-Billancourt - since 1980. The study shows that the rights to build and the programs of ZACs may influence the real estate activity and its spatial distribution significantly. However this link is not systematic and exhibits non trivial features.
