The SPOT satellite imagery has been used to follow the development of aquaculture over the last decade in the wetlands and former salt-pans between the mouths of Guadiana and Guadalquivir rivers in Atlantic Andalousia (Spain). The rapid spread of aquaculture is observed and measured. The effects on the environment, discernible by remote sensing, are also studied.
