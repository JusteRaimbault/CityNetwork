Spatial point pattern analysis of large data sets involves powerful visualization techniques. This paper intends to present two suitable methodsÂ : the first one is based on kernel density estimation technique, while the second uses regular grid of quadrats superimposed on the event distribution. Both methods are applied to road accidents analysis in the urban community of Lille (France).
