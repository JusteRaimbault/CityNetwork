This article aims to analyze the dynamics of the housing stock in Bogota between 1973 and 1993. We set up a typology "multi-dates" conceived in order to account for the strong and permanent structures of the habitat and in housing conditions of the households of Bogota. Methodology suggested consists in defining a coherent space of reference, the whole of the households listed in 1973 and 1993 and working on usual descriptors of the morphology of the frame and housing conditions of the households, commun runs to many devices of data acquisition with robust tools of multidimensional exploratory analysis. These structures are significant with their localization and in the confrontation of the types of housing with the characteristics of the occupying households. They especially make it possible to analyze in a total way the evolution, the transformation of the habitat between 1973 and 1993 and the space dynamics of the park of housing.
