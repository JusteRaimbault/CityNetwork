The aim of this paper is to model the potential accessibility to jobs in the French municipalities according to the distance to urban centre. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follow. Section 1 formulates the measure of job accessibility and explains methodology and data to compute a travel time matrix between French municipalities following the road network. Section 2 shows empirical results: the disparity of job accessibility according to the distance to the nearest urban center and according to places of residence (urban centers, periurban fringe, predominantly rural areas).
