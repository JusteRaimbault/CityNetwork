This social geographical inquiry shows how peripheral university students connect their everyday living spaces. Based on quantitative and qualitative evidence, this article explores the living spaces and mobility practices of students from Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée University. Mobility issue is at stake in East Paris, a space between Paris city, suburbs and the surrounding rural area, characterized by polycentrism. In a context of large and polycentric in-between spaces, students experience a high mobility level. It does not mean emancipation. At the opposite, it reveals a stronger dependence towards parents’assets, family car uses and public transports. Thus, students are unequal as regards to mobility facilities. At the end, the article shows that these students have practices quite similar with suburban “franciliens”, and more precisely with carless households. Resulting from a negotiation between choices and constraints, proximity and distance, they create original living spaces.
