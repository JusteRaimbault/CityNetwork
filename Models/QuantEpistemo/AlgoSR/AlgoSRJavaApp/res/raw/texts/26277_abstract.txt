This paper focuses on the spatial concepts that Hannah Arendt has referred to throughout her work. It also underlines how spatial is her analysis of the main political and anthropological questions she has addressed in her most famous books. It concludes that the diversity of the spatial proposals in Arendt’s work is organized with three spatialities or conceptions of space: The spatiality of places, the spatiality of positions, and the spatiality of action. These spatialities do not refer to three independant modes of existence of space; they are articulated in her analysis of human condition and of “common worlds” and subsumed to two others concepts, even much more central, in her work: identity and plurality.
