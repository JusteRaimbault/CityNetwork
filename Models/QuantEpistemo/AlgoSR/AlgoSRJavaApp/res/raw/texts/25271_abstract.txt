We present and comment several methods and tools to visualize the internal graphical complexity of cartographic images, making clearly visible this particular form of complexity. The methods are tested on several types of thematic maps, and the results are discussed in relation to their usefulness to the cartographer and the map reader. The software tools that were developed are available as public web services. They could be later proposed as add-ons to cartographic softwares.
