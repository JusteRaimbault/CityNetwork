The vegetation mapping of the South Corsica coastal area (Sartène - Porto-Vecchio) is realised within the context of the International Park of Bouches de Bonifacio Project. Its main purpose is to study vegetation types and to assess the natural diversity of the site. The methodology is based on interpretation of aerial photographs at scale 1 : 25000 associated with field investigations and Geographical Information System technologies.
