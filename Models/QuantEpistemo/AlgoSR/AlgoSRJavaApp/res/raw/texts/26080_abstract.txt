The spatial structure of mobility flows is a key element in order to understand the functional reorganisation of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region (France). Mobility flows can be used to define urban networks and to follow their evolution over time. This paper analyses inter-municipal dominant flows of daily and residential mobility derived from census data over the 1980s and the 1990s. On the whole, regional urban networks grow stronger and become more complex over time. They shape two metropolitan networks showing different network configurations. Other differences can be observed between the spatial extent of commuting dominant flows, which are linked to the daily functioning of metropolitan areas, and that of residential mobility dominant flows, which are more linked to household life cycles.
