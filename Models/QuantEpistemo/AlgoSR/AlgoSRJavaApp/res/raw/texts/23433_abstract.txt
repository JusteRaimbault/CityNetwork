Built on S. Lupasco’s logic and L. Bolk’s neoteny, the 2009 paper [Reymond, 2009a] proposed a geographical model with a transdisciplinary cybernetic framework. The present paper, its continuation, shows that neoteny, a concept still difficult to quite settle into yet, can, however, be at the root of homo geographicus and the technical objects that he creates and, in particular, these concentrations of population we call cities. With this object in mind, the paper regroups the concepts of sphere (P. Sloterdijk), enaction (F.J. Varela), transduction (G. Simondon) and fractality (B. Mandelbrot) which, embedded into Lupasco’s logic, leads toward a geographical theory joining contradictory antagonism to mediance (A. Berque) and space/range (H. Reymond). In this context, the paradigm of complexity and H. Reichholf’s surplus theory are used and accepted, without having been deeply examined, and a development of the urbanization phenomenon in three phases is suggested : eco-anthroposystemic, biospherically limited, anthropo-geosystemic, economically unbridled, and geo-anthroposystemic, ecologically thought-out. This geohistoric reading of the geosystem concept results in an epistemological reflection on the elaboration of a geoanthropological ethics.
