A study was conducted in a Sahel pastoral area in Mauritania from 1987 to 1989 which involved the application of satellite sensor images to ground surveys, to determine the surface areas of different types of land cover and in particular those suitable for raising livestock. In the preparation phase, satellite sensor images were used in conjonction with the sampling plan that monitored the land cover inventory. During the ground survey phase, images representing enlarged survey units were used to complement the survey records. Finally, in the analytical phase, remote sensing was used not only to draw ground inventory maps but also to correct, by regression, the estimation of the surface areas of the various categories of land cover detected. The findings of our study show that remote sensing, while allowing for a reduced sample size during the ground survey phase, provides for a high level of accuracy in the estimation of surface areas.
