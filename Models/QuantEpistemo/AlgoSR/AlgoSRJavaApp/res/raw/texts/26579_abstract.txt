OASIS is an automatic internet interface that provides a wide set of statistical and cartographic tools for the analysis of spatial variables. Compared to what already exists, OASIS displays several advantages. Firstly, it is a complete platform that proposes new tools and includes a very large range of standard tools currently scattered in several software and interfaces. Secondly, OASIS provides access to a series of variables frequently used in the literature on spatial inequalities and segregation, which are available here at municipal scale for the entire metropolitan France (base maps included). Lastly, OASIS brings forward novel tools that allow for the testing of the statistical significance of all segregation and auto-correlation indexes with the help of Monte Carlo simulations. To our best knowledge, this kind of fully automatized tools are nowhere available, despite the obvious importance of ensuring the statistical reliability of spatial analyses.
