In this paper, we focus upon rural structures, land use and agricultural traditions in the Great Canary Island as they are expressed and even thought today through a specific set of words built over centuries, differing semantically from those used in other hispanic countries and islands. These terms reflect the way land use and property, as well as hydraulic systems were implemented both as outcomes and indices of the successive layers of social and economic structures.
