Since the Rio Summit, the sustainable development has become a part of the international law. The International participation in the subsidized projects related to sustainable development has further strengthened its importance.

Local actors do not seem to be willing to accommodate locally the sustainable development. This article aims to open a debate about this gap between policy as willingness and practice as action locally built.
