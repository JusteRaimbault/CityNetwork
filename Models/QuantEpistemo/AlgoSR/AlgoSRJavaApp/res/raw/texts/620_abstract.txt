The 1987-1993 evolution of the Alg√∂l lake (eastern part of the Konya plain) is mapped and mesaured, using diachronic approach of 2 SPOT XS imagery. The contraction observed is related to increasing water withdrawals from underground water resources. Geomorphological maps are established on other sites, to show the evolution of the lacustrine and marshy environments during Late Pleistocene.
