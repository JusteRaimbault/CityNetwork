It is well known that the social perception of coastal zone has partly changed under the influence of painting since the XVIIIth and XIXth centuries. However, this influence may only have concerned beaches, cliffs and ports, but in no way coastal wetlands. For medical, economical, social, technical and æsthetical reasons, this specific environment remained ignored by French painters till the beginning of the XXth century – what could partly be an explanation for its long-standing repulsive image in the French society. Nevertheless, picture and status of wetlands have recently evolved, as well as the social perception and the social context regarding them – last proof of a mutual but changing influence between pictorial representations, social perception and social context. The analysis of French painters’ actual works will illustrate this reversal and offer a dialogue between painting and geography.
