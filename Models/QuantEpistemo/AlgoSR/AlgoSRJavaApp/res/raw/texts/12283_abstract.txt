The emotions that as inhabitants we feel towards our environment suggest that we have an aesthetic relation to our territory. The formal criticism of works of art allows to extend the content of geographical discussion beyond technical considerations and to renew the understanding of the political stakes involved in our existence. Aesthetic pleasure is a way to make the space of architects and that of geographers coincide. The work of Frank Lloyd Wright may be viewed as an illustration of what such an approach can bring to territorial evaluation, all the more so as the formal research he undertook about space in domestic architecture stems from his ambitious conception of the territorial development of the United States. Far from being hostile to urbanity, Frank Lloyd Wright was throughout his career preoccupied with imagining the shape a modern city might take as a result of the free expression of its inhabitants. His visionary reflection can help us enrich our way of looking at the city-to-be.
