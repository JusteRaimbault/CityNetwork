The ecological restoration debates concerns environmental aesthetics. The latter will be initially introduced before carrying out the examination of various types of practices and of reflexions into the field of ecological restoration. The examination of these debates shows to which point the separation between nature and culture on which they rest proceeds of an empiricism which denies the determining character of the environment on the individuation of the human being. This article is based on the communications made during an international symposium entitled “Environment, aesthetic engagement and public spaces: the stake of the landscape” held on May 9th, 10th and 11th 2007 in Paris.
