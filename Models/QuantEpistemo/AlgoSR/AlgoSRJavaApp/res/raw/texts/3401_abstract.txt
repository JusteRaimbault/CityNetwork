In a previous article, I have presented the theorical contributions of phenomenology to the concept of dwelling such as we can use them in geography. Through the analysis of a concrete case the present article tries to make more explicit these different contributions of phenomenology and the possibility of suggesting methods and techniques which fit perfectly into this type of investigation in geography. In this way the use of methods which are both pragmatic and hermeneutic and the use of techniques of double interviews allow to rethink the constructions which inhabitants ake about the world and the meaning which they give to then.
