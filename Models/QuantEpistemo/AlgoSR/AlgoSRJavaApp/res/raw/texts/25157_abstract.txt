With the diffusion of the principles of systems dynamics, geography has experienced an important evolution since the 1980s. Consequently, the development of cellular automata or multi-agent systems and their progressive coupling with geographic information systems have taken place. Recent works have shown that the problem of urban sprawl was particularly well-suited to this kind of systems. In this paper, we focus on the formalization of dynamics, where we propose to simulate the urban growth under the congestion constraint. In order to design this model, we combine operating and interaction assumptions of urban spaces such as gravitation or fluid mechanics (theory of traffic). We also propose to check the validity of this system at the municipal level for the urban area of Dijon and to validate the growth hypotheses of this city and the ones of its suburban area by 2030.
