This paper offers a contribution to the debate sparked off by the annual publication of the report on World Development 2009 entitled “Reshaping economic geography”. It lists and evaluates the choices of urbanization data set and the way theses geographical measures are used in order to support development politics supporting demographic and economic concentration. It underlines the badly avoid difficulty to work with non-harmonized national wide urban data set ; evaluates the limits of the attempt to use harmonized data ; and suggests an alternative measure of world urbanization that emphasis the bias of the World Bank report notably to overestimation of metropolitanization and the way burgeoning micro-urbanization is kept in the dark.
