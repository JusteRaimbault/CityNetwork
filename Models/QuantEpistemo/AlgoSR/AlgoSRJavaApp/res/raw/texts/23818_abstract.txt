The article examines slavery in the Brazilian countryside by mapping available data on releases of slave laborers and denunciations of slavery cases. It analyzes the distribution of the phenomenon in Brazil, identifies situations related to slavery, and builds composite probability indices of the presence of slaves and vulnerability to recruitment. We hope to contribute to the fight against slavery in rural areas, facilitating its repression and its prevention.
