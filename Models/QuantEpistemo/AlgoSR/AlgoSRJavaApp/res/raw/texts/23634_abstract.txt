In this article, we compare two databases, one providing mobility data for 34 European cities (UITP database), and the other database providing population density grid cells for these cities at 200m scale. Looking towards sustainable urban forms, we assess explanatory power of socio-economic and morphological indicators, with respect to seven mobility indicators, including the energy consumption per inhabitant due to transport (base year 2001). We conclude that classical urban indicators (GDP per inhabitant, population density) and more precise morphological indicators (entropy, rank-size slope) are complementary towards such objectives.
