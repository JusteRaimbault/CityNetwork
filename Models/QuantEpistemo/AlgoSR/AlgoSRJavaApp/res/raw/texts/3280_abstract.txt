Understanding the process and speed of spatio-temporal changes on pionnier fronts in Latino America involves today the use of fine resolution satellite images and the use of appropriate methodologies to analyse multispectral and multidated informations in order to ensure a useful thematic indication, and a updated cartography of a disrupted environment. This is the subject of this demonstration which explains on this detailed study on a test site which was totally virgin ten years ago. This site is located in the north-west of Peten in Guatemala. Joint analyses of aerial photographs and Spot image sequence from the period 1987 to 2002, allow to measure gradually the deforestation, the impact of migratory population flows, the methods of illegal land appropriations. This study focuses on different production methods and territorialisation too, according to origins of the settlers.
