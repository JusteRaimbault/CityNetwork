This study examines the population redistribution in Sweden at municipality level between 1970 and 1996. The aims of this study are to analyse : (1) the importance of migration and geographical variations in fertility and mortality for the redistribution of population between municipalities in Sweden from 1970 to 1996 ; and (2) the impacts of age composition in municipalities versus local age-specific fertility, mortality and migration rates on changes in population distribution. The population change in each municipality was calculated as if it was only affected by one demographic factor at the time. The results of these counterfactual scenarios were compared to actual population change and the effect of fertility, mortality, in- and out-migration and age composition was thereby isolated. Measurements of concentration have been used in order to analyse the changing population distribution. The main demographic factor behind the redistribution since 1970 is the geographical differences in age composition and its effects on the natural population change. It is demonstrated that this factor lies behind the trend towards increasing concentration in Sweden, while the impact of migration affects the fluctuations from this trend to a greater extent.
