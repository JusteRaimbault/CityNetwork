This study deals with the pluridisciplinar approach to design an environmental model of a part of the Mer dâ€™Iroise Biosphere Reserve (Brittany, France). A multi-agents system (MAS) is implemented. Different scenarios simulate future plausible situations which bring information for land management and which makes the local population aware of the stakes of the environmental concertation. For this purpose a role playing game in a participatory modelling process is proposed to the Ushant population.
