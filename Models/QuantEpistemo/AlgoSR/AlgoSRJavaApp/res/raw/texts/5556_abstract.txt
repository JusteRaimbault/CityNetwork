The concept of system is probably deeply rooted in ecological thinking. However, the importance of space in the inetercations within a system is fairly new. In this manuscript, we recall the classical Lotka-Volterra model to model communities of interacting populations, and an historical result by May, linking stability and diversity in randomly connected Lotka-Volterra systems. The concept of permanence is introduced, as well as an interpretation of this result in a case which we hope closer to geographers concern, i.e. when the space plays a key role for commanding interactions. We show that restricting interactions between neighbours has a stabilising effect on a global equilibrium.
