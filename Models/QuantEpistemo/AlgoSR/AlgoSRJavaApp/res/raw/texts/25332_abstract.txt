The notion of life space was first proposed by geographers, then demographers, mostly interested in migration, picked up on the idea: individuals are no longer exclusively tied to their place of residence, but rather to every place with which they have a link. In empirical terms, the quantitative description of individual life spaces in demography involves two preliminary steps: delimiting the boundaries of the studied life space, according to its various dimensions; then finding the relevant specific sets of data. This paper sets out the introduction and operationalization of the notion of life space in demography, and then proposes an empirical descriptive application based on individual survey data and avenues for its use in migration studies.
