Borders in Central Asia became international in 1991, although their existence and definition had often been controversial. The post-Soviet states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) have now adopted these borders and use them as a tool to build their territorial independence. Borders have been equipped and functionalized, so that they have become key territorial structures in the regional space. In that way, they contribute to marking out national territories and consolidating states. The enforcement of these new borders has cut off some areas and divided others, which threatens the cohesion of national space but also encourages the emergence of national territoriality. This unprecedented compartmentalisation of Central Asia raises questions about how nations and regions cohabit and highlight the original links between globalisation and deregionalisation.
