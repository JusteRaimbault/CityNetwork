In Languedoc-Roussillon region, a strong population growth is an important factor of change in the equipment and public utilities of the commune, as well as in retails and services (PURSE) frequentations, mainly in urban rings and region margins.To keep or install equity in access to PURSE, especially because spatial disparities are strong, is a critical question of country planning. Structure and PURSE frequentations analysis in 1979 and 1988 allows to appreciate restructuring appeared in that dynamics. In a decade, population and area attraction contrasts have declined : intermediate levels gather strength, while population spreads in the country. The prevailing form of PURSE frequentations network is hierarchical, but more than 30 per cent of communes are engaged in complementarity relationships, which are in progress. That kind of relation reveal intercommunity links : communes complement each other in PURSE possession and frequentations. That communes could represent &quot;fictitious small market towns&quot; to encourage PURSE rentability in that places. The combined analysis of populations variables, PURSE frequentations, commuting and a road network shows the burst of the old cellular structure of towns in Languedoc-Roussillon, for the benefit of the major cities : Montpellier, Nimes, and of minor importance Perpignan.Two practices of the territory appear : a local territoriality according preferences to proximity PURSE frequentations, and a nomadic territoriality where employment and PURSE request to go to the major town. That study is a first attempt of a &quot;moving net&quot; on the territory, adjusted and functional, where interdependancy and social process preservation should be the ins of rural planning operations.
