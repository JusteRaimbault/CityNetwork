EUROSIM is a multi-agent model for simulating the short term evolution of the European urban system. The agents, the largest cities, are collective entities, whose attributes are size and function within the system of cities. Their interactions, based upon spatial proximity or connexity within networks, are controlling the relative dynamics while the global growth is driven by innovation. Multiscalar tools of analysis are presented in order to interpret the outputs of the model and facilitate the calibration.
