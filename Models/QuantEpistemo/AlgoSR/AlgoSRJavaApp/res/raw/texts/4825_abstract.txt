The analysis of the ski lift and of the ski slope distributions, is performed in the case of the Serre Chevalier resort. First, we show that the number and the rate of building of this equipment follow logistic equations over a 50 years period of time. Rank-size curves show some hierarchies of lift characteristics. Using the Fractalyse code, we confirm that the spatial distribution of the two networks â€“ approximated to an invariant scale system- is relevant to fractal geometry. The values of the fractal dimensions depend on the opportunities of the lifts, of the difficulties of the slopes, and of the distribution of the two networks. Some conclusions could be deduced from these results to characterize the ski resorts.
