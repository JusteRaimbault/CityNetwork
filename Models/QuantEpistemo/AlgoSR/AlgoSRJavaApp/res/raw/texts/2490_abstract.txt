While educational geography gets its legitimacy, partly by a declared link with scientific geography, teachers epistemological choices are subjected to a complex set of determinations, not always explicit or conscious. It varies according to individuals and their experiences, situations and job contexts. The notion of a practical connection to epistemology tries to describe the real nature of the work of geography teachers and to makes it sense. Our proposal is based on a didactic approach of to educational geography. It takes into account the way people are related to their jobs and professional world insofar as it constrains what they teach. It develops a methodology called reasoning by case. It is not intended to impose or offer solutions, but to describe and to make sense of facts that are not well known.
