Nowadays, microcomputers operating systems offer user-friendly interfaces. Moreover, some micro-GIS have interesting development possibilities through plug ins, in the common programming languages : Pascal, C, Delphi, etcâ€¦ On this basis, we have complemented functions of one micro-GIS (spatial requests, itinerary calculation, data managing, cartography) with a set of statistical and graphical modules. These tools give to users all statistical informations and graphical representations that are necessary for a comprehensive data analysis. Interactive links between modules allow a global approach, and the comparison and merging of different methods of analysis. Lastly, the associated map is triggered anytime clusters of individuals are defined. Indeed, we do have a complete interactivity between GIS, maps, and statistical modules. However, we plan to go further in experimenting of other graphic tools, especialy in the exploitation of factor analysis results.
