This paper presents a synthesis map that shows the spatial dynamics of gentrification in Paris since the 1960s. The notion of gentrification has been extensively studied since the 1970s, especially in England and Northern America, but the researchers seldom focused on the spatial dynamics of gentrification in a given city, and they seldom made map about this. Gentrification as such begins to be studied in France. The synthesis map I present here is based on a global approach of this process in Paris on various scales and, particularly, on three different sources : first, statistical analyses of the 1982, 1990 and 1999 census data, second, the works by Daniel Noin and Yvan Chauviré published in L’Atlas des Parisiens (1984), and third, a field work conducted from 2004 to 2007 in three neighbourhoods that are at different stages of gentrification. From theses different sources, gentrification in Paris can be interpreted as a diffusion process from the Western and left-bank Beaux quartiers. This corroborates the Anglo-American analysis, following which gentrification is a process of social conquest that takes the shape of a frontier. This paper aims to present an original map of this process about Paris.
