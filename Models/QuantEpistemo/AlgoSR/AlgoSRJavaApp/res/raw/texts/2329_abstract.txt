This paper proposes an exploratory study on a representation of countries sorted by socio-spatial complexes of risks within HIV. Using Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) on a set of socio-geographic, socio-economic variables with epidemiological features presents one way to synthesis infection structures. Used data are part of selective statistical results on 44 sub-Saharan countries that have been recently published. Both socio-geographic and economic components associated in Adult 15-49 years old population groups interfere in complex combinations varying from a place to an other. The set of insular (Comoros, Madagascar) and Atlantic countries (Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea) with low rate of infection (< 3 %) point out low exposure states. The southern set of rich countries (South Africa, Namibia, Swaziland, Botswana) with infection rates exceeding 12 % indicate high exposure conditions. Between these two extreme states, others diversified exposure situations can be differentiated and mapped. Sets of high endemic conditions, epidemic rise and deep epidemic occurred respectively in the East, in the West and in the Center of Africa.
