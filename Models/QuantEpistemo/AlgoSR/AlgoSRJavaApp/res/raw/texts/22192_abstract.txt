This paper aims at showing how the estimations of individual shopping travel behavior depends upon the city. To this end, we use nested multinomial logit models with random coefficients, and apply them to shopping trips in four different Belgian cities (Aalst, Antwerpen, Mechelen and Gent). Results highly depend upon the studied city: spatial behavior is influenced by the size and morphology of the city. These results are quite important when starting a data collection step, which is often expensive and time consuming. Large samples are necessary, and one needs to be careful when generalizing from only one case study. Space matters.
