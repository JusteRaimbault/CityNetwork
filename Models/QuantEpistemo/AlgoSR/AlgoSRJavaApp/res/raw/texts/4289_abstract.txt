Emerging applications such as cartography and multi-representation require new data modelling concepts to take into account specific characteristics of geographical data such as multi representation and dynamic spatial objects. This paper presents a multi-layered functional data model that allows the specification of geographic data at two levels: generic and domain. The generic level defines general spatial concepts that are common to different applications. The domain level specializes the general special concepts to model specific characteristics of different applications. We use the concept of role to define the semantics and structural links among different geographical data representations. The proposed model is illustrated by an urban application example.
