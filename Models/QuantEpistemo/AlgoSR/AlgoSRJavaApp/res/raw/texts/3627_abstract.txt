The article analyses the way the scale changes in association with the change of register. It is based on the analyses of the overlapping of two processes during the years 1830-1840. The first process corresponds to the developments of the arguments of a Deputy who at the beginning of is career relies on the local territory that elected him but who then progressively turns to the national scale. The second process concerns the discussion about the reform of the postal tariff that goes gradually from the reference to the territory and its roughness to an approach through social relations. The whole is to be seen within the framework of the years that precedes the start of the Second Republic bringing the Universal Suffrage, the unique Postal Tariff and the support of this Deputy for the Republican ideal.
