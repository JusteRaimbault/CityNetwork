We carry out a study about a consequence of the functional evolution of the European political boundariesÂ : the increasing number of crossborder commuters. The purpose of this paper is to study the evolution and the spatial diffusion of this practice since the seventies in Alsace, the first French region affected by this phenomenon. First we will show the different factors that cause the regular growth of these flows and their unidirectional orientation. Finally, we will analyse the processes of spatial diffusion of this practice and their partial distortion by the major Alsatian cities.
