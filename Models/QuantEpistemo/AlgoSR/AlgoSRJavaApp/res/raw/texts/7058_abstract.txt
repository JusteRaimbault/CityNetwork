The aim of this article is to expose the context in which the mapping and the use of Geographical Information Systems within the field of crime and security expanded, and through different experiences show the various uses of maps. First will be considered the theoretical and the political context in which emerged the spatial approach of crime in France. The major turn took place in the early 80’s, when the object studied in criminology changed. Focus on crime as an act, instead of crime as a delinquent person, would allow geographers to develop a new approach based on explanations linked to the local conditions in which the delinquent act took place. However the use of maps and Geographical Information Systems within the field of crime and security expanded in France only in the latest 90’s. This development of spatial analysis of the delinquent act was linked with the situational crime prevention politics and the implementation of the “Contrats Locaux de Sécurité” (Local security contracts). Secondly, this article proposes a classification of maps uses in the security field considering three points of view : time, space and variety of data types. This typology is drawn from the authors various experiences in several French institutions and/or companies (INHES, RATP, SNCF). First of all, two operational uses are pointed out : knowledge and tactical use. Maps are here shown as a tool for local actors in order to assess their knowledge of the location of the delinquent acts and to organize the prevention and struggle against crime. Then two analytical uses are identified : strategic and political use. In these perspectives the map is on the one hand a decision-making tool and on the other hand a tool for evaluation of the efficiency of the actions implemented against crime.
