During the last decades, vast suburbs were formed around Algerian cities. Planned or not, these suburbs are of different varieties. This work will draw the opposition between  two kinds of these suburbs by analysing the inhabitants perceptions about the living spaces that this suburbs offer. Called Bengladesch, the "600 habitations", section is included in  the large planned site of the western valley situated in the suburbs of Annaba. In the 1980’s, this programme offered housing for a part of the population which was previously living in an informal site. Considered today as the true Medina of Guelma, Oued Skhoun is, on the contrary a sprawling and informal urban space which includes a real commercial dynamic. Bengladesh or Medina, the inhabitants perceptions related to these two spaces are, there fore, radically contradictory. Rationally planned, the "600 habitations" section is, nevertheless, a poor and ill-conditioned region. On the other hand, Oued Skhoun propose sprawling urban forms  liable to bring profit for the whole inhabitants of Guelma.
