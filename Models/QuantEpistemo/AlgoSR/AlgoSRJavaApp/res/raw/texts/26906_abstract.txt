Environmental economics can be applied to enhance areas and contribute to the conservation and protection of the environmental richness of ecosystems. It is a powerful tool that contributes in a general way to preserve nature, as well as planning and landing management. This research was developed on the Fundo El Carmen property, located in the city of Quilpué in Chile, with a main objective to value environmental goods and services. According to land planning instruments, in the results we present considerations oriented to environmental conservation at local and regional level. It is worth to note that for the Fundo El Carmen property the existing instruments did not deliver environmental conservation uses based on the proper identification of the highest value areas, consequently dismissing the biggest part of this environmental wealth.
