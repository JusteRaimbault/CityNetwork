Analysing the spatial diffusion of discourses expressed about « neoliberalism » since the 1930’s brings to light a series of geographical transpositions linked to recurrent semantic splits. The reference to « neoliberalism » which appeared in France and designating a European school of thought has since then been applied to various geographic areas (West Germany, the Latin American states, the world) to qualify contrasting political practices. These successive geo-semantic shifts resulted in a polysemic, confusing and contradictory label. In these conditions, it seems necessary to try and better define the various forms of neoliberalisms that structure the political organization of territories and societies which inhabit them.
