Reading is a common living experience ; it is source of dualism : travel through a linear oriented structure as well as graphe's projection on an imaginary screen. It is mostly automatic, underconscious. The reader's pleasure rises in this consciousness annulment. However, reading is part of the geographer's craft, where analysis replace reading, therefore ruling out its automatic dimension. Nevertheless, to move about, to outdistance, to take or lose one's bearings are metaphorically used while reading. This spatial knowledge is further achieved with hypertexte, which could be better used than current text to organise and unfold geographic knowledge.
