In France, the strong storms of the last decades and their impacts on coasts led to emphasize the relationships which may exist between the climate change and coastal erosion and flooding. It seems however necessary to consider the contemporaneous geomorphological dynamics of the coasts in the context of their evolution depending upon various factors such as the Flandrian transgression, the marine and climate weather, the sedimentary budget and human impacts. Some examples of coastal evolution in Brittany allow to remind that the shoreline mobility results from processes acting at various scales of time and space. In that context, the predictable impacts of the climate change could act as an aggravating factor in an already very unfavorable situation reinforced by the stakes growth.
