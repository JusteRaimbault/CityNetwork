In projects of urban sustainability, the uses of assessment by indicators are growing. Since 2007, Paris city council established a dashboard of indicators based on a guidebook for sustainable town planning so called “Un aménagement durable pour Paris”. This dashboard allows assessing urban planning projects, in order to increase the efficiency in terms of sustainability of urban operations. The aim is to progress towards sustainability thanks to this experiment.
