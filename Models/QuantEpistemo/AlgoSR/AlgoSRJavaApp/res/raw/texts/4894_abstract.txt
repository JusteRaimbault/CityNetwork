The presence of Black people in South African cities has long been severely limited and controlled by the segregation and apartheid regimes. The spaces they were allocated were designed for those purposes. Nevertheless, new social forms and an original and dynamic urban culture are today thriving in the same spaces. This paper shows how family structures, internal organisation of houses, and the networks of associations achieved these transformations. The analysis of mental maps also confirms the fact that space in Black neighbourhoods is most significantly a projection of social relations and networks.
