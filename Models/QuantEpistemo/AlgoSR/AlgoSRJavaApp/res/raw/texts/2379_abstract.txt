Most models of residential mobility describe observed behaviour as a function of socioeconomic and demographic covariates of the households involved and an error term. This term encompasses both unobserved constraints on the housing market and omitted variables. For theoretical and policy reasons the unobserved constraints are a major weakness. Overt behaviour of movers is treated as "revealed"preferences. In reality actual behaviour is a function of preferences of the household involved and the availability and accessibility on the spatial housing market. This implies also that no account is made of delay of moves or accepting what is available instead of what is highly preferred. This last type of behaviour is referred as substitution. A change of the availability and accessibility of supply will influence behaviour, but will be unobserved in the estimations. The objective of this article is summarize the results of a research project on bridging the gap between models that measure 'castle in the air' and model that measure ' my house is my castle'. The methode used is the Decision Plan Net.
