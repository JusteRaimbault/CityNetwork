The objective is to identify places of spatial concentration of road accidents by black zones rather than black points. The application of a geographical analysis method based on local measures of spatial autocorrelation permits to localise black zones. The relevance of the method is considered and a sensibility study of the results is proposed. The application of the method to an example of road shows its appropriation to the problem of black zones identification.
