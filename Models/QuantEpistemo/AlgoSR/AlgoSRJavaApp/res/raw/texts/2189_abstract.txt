This paper aims to identify the problems that arise when a transportation network has to be represented by one - or several - parameter(s). A short review of the literature leads to the conclusion that at present there is no single and unambiguous criterion with which to distinguish two graphs that are topologically distinct. Perspectives are discussed regarding the effects of the shape of the communication network on the results of an optimal location model.
