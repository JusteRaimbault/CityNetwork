This paper deals with the disparities of influence between port cities from the accessibility to population and wealth perspective. The location of port cities relative to trunk road routes and markets has an impact on their traffic and area of influence. There are major disparities between, and in the ranges. These disparities are quantified and analysed from a sample of 73 cities, using various accessibility indices. The resulting hierarchies give an insight of the dominance of some port cities on others that can help shape local and regional planning policies.
