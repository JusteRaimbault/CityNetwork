This paper focuses on evaluating usability of a Web-based Public Participatory GIS (Web-PPGIS) in the context of a real-world application. The empirical study involves the use of ArgooMap to support users in an online public participatory decision-making process where the users are asked to find the “best” location for a new parkade in the downtown of Canmore, Alberta. The datasets on system usability have been collected automatically using UsaProxy software.We have found that there are significant differences in the system usability among the participants. The system usability is higher for users with GIS experience, higher education levels, and more web surfing experience. The findings provide insights for Web-PPGIS practitioners to advance such systems. It is noticed that the way the Web-PPGIS website was advertised may influence the results. An approach to avoid this problem is needed.
