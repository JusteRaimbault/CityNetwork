Multifunctionality of agriculture is nowadays recognized by rural and agricultural policies but we donâ€™t know exactly what are its consequences on farms management and on farmers practices. A survey of some farms of a french rural area (la Dombes near Lyon) permitted to analyse how farmers manage cultivated lands and fish production in ponds, hunting, and protection of birds. We identify areas, practices and farming organisation patterns which with farmers take into account on their farms the multifonctionnality of the territory. Our work opens a new way for an applicated research to help farmers to plan the use of land on their farm sustainable development.
