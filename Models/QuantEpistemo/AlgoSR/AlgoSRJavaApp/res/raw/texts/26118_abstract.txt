The objectives of sustainable development in urban policies - beyond its heterogeneity – lead to negotiations between local levels of government and the operators of economic sectors involved in the organization of cities. In river cities, a negotiation is taking place between the different urban governments (municipal and inter-municipal levels) and the inland waterway managers and the port authorities. This negotiation seems to open a new chapter in the history of the relationship city / river by introducing reflections on reconnection. Two aspects of this reconnection are currently explored through various planning instruments: bringing industrial and port wasteland back into urban use (since the 1980s and 1990s) and considering the utility of ports with regard to sustainable development (since the beginning of the years 2000). The attempt to reconnect the city to the port and the port to the city may constitute a spatial issue. This reconnection, surrounded by conflicts, contributes to the evolution of urban morphology. The example of the French cities of Lyon and Strasbourg provides an illustration of this point.
