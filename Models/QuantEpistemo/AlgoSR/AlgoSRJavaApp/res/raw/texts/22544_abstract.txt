The Italian edition of the Nouvelle Géographie Universelle isn’t completely faithful to original text, because its translator and editor Attilio Brunialti, geographer, jurist, politician belonging to Depretis’ party, and very engaged for Italian colonialism, adds two volumes about Italy completely written by him, although all the work remains signed by the name Eliseo Reclus. Crossing the two texts about Italy, we discover two perspectives, similar by some aspects, but very different by many others, about geography, society and politics of the young Italian nation during the Age of the Empires.
