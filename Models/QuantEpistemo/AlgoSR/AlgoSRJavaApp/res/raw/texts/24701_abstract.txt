The urban dynamics during the XXe century makes it possible to understand the problems created by urban expansion (polluting industry on the littoral, clogging of the road traffic in the downtown area…) in Sfax agglomeration. The urban heat island was detected using NOAA-AVHRR data and in parallel, air temperature and sea breeze velocity and direction was observed in some points in the city. All these observations show that the downtown area is considerably hotter than the suburbs (variation around 5°C) and sea breeze is strongly slowed down there because of the roughness of the city. These two factors create discomfort conditions for the population. Monoxide carbon (CO) rate measurements, used here like tracer of pollution, were also carried out on several points in the agglomeration. It shows the major role of the urban traffic or, during some weather conditions, the establishments located in south Industrial Area (Chemical industiy, waste incineration). The spatial extension of sulfur dioxide (SO2), obtained by digital model, by using weather parameters, shows the strong influence of the sea breeze on the space concentration and distribution of this polluting.
