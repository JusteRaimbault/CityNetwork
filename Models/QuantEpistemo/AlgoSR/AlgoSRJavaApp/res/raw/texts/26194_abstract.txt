As a particular kind of prospective, the geoprospective emerged from the convergence between geographic, modelling and prospective studies. It aims to provide a better basis for integrating territories during the process of exploring the future through the use of various methods. This approach goes beyond considering the spatial dimension as a simple support to render the possible futures of territories. Three fields of research have contributed to its emergence: the companion modelling, the prospective and the modelling of land use and land cover changes. This article presents a short state of the art of the geoprospective and introduces some recommendations regarding the use of models.
