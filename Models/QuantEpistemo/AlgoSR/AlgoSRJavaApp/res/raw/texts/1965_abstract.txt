Urban sprawl, and its main form of disperse city, increases the competition for land and the conversion of agricultural land. We analysed the municipal land planning policies in periurban areas in order to understand how agricultural landscape and activities were taken into account in such policies. In a medium town of the Midi-Pyrénées region, Albi, we characterised the periurban dynamics in terms of demography and landscape changes. We then interviewed mayors and one public servant of the land planning service of twelve municipalities of the urban and periurban area. As a result, we identified four qualifications of agricultural activities : as a disappearing land use, as a land occupation useful for the urban land management, as a producer of urban open spaces, and as an economic activity. We then discuss the implication of these results in terms of periurban farms multifunctionality.
