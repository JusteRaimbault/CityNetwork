Spatial data quality has been attracting much interest. Much of the problem lies in the degree to which current data structures are unable to model the real world and the way imperfections in the data may propagate during analyses and cast doubt on the validity of the outcomes. Much of the research has concentrated on the quantitative accuracy of spatial data, the derivation of indices and their propagation through analyses. Geographical data invariably includes an element of interpretation for which linguistic hedges of uncertainty may be generated. The paper presents a new technique of handling such expressions in a GIS through fuzzy expectation - intuitive probabilities linked to stylized fuzzy sets. By using fuzzy expectation as linguistic building blocks, many of the difficulties in using fuzzy set descriptors in GIS have been overcome. The stylized fuzzy sets can be propagated using Boolean operators to give a resultant fuzzy set which can be ‘translated’ back into a linguistic quality statement. For the first time, linguistic criteria of fitness-for-use can be derived for GIS outputs regardless of the language being used.
