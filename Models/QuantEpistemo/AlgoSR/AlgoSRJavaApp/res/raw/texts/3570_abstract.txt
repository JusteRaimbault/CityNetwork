This contribution deals with a methodological framework dedicated to long-term changes modelling of the coastal environment under human activities influences. This research is focused on a modeling simulation methodology fitted to the analysis of interactions between human activities and environment. The methodology is based on the development of reality models which integrate spatio-temporal constraints (socio-economic, regulation and meteorology) in order to analyse activities progress and impact.
