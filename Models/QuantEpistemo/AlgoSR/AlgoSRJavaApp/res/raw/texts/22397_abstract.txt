This paper proposes to organize an ongoing geographical field of specific questions on spatial systems around a transdisciplinary cybernetic design. Structured as a developer, it is built on the contradictory antagonistic logic of S. Lupasco and associates the mediance of A. Berque, the dissipative structures of I. Prigogine and the enaction of F. Varela. This screening process allows us to compare the significance of the concrete resilience of the M’zab based solely on water control and that of the world system assessed according to the conceptual indication of the ecological footprint. One arrives at the heuristic necessity to separate a weak cybernetic self-organization through combinations from a strong self-organization through interactive triggers. A guide to geographical research is thus proposed, to the point of suggesting substantial modeling for experimentation. In conjunction with this construct, the outline of a geographical theory of anthropogenesis based on L. Bolk’s neoteny is suggested, which holds to the hypothesis that Homo sapiens sapiens is fundamentally Homo geographicus.
