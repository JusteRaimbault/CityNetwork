One of the requirements which are poorly supported by spatial data models is a consistent management of different representations of the same spatial phenomena under different viewpoints or at different resolutions. In this paper, we first identify the needs induced by the coexistence of multiples representations of the same objects, then we propose a set of concepts allowing the specification of several representations for the same real world object, the description of topological relationship validity, to link objets describing the same reality and finally to describe and query objects and their attributes at different levels of semantic resolution.
