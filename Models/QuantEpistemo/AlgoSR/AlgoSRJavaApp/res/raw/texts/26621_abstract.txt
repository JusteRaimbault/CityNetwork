To teach about France, the new geography curricula do not make any suggestion as far as work on a definition of France is concerned. This institutional abstention contrasts with the public expressions of territorial views, linked with the “national identity” theme. Nevertheless some teachers have chosen to address the question of a geographical definition of France, with their pupils as contributors. We consider these initiatives as opportunities to clear up what it is like, nowadays, to work as a geography teacher in high schools. Therefore we work with the sociology of engagement, and borrow from it the notion of “trial”, associated with taking up of a challenge. Last, an analysis of varied pupils works enables us to extend the definition of “trial”.
