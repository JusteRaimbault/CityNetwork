As many other cities of the South, Bogota, the capital of Colombia, entered twenty years ago into a new phase of development, slower than the former: the peripherical expansion dynamic turned into another dynamic dominated by population redistribution in the urban area. This article aims at analysing the evolution and the transformations of the main forms of the socio-spatial configuration from 1973 to1993. For that, we set up a “multi-dates” typology in order to show the perennials structures of the socio-demographic composition of Bogota. The methodology suggested consists in defining a coherent reference area that is the set of households listed in 1973 and in 1993 and working on basic socio-demographic variables on the households that are factual recognized information. The use of typological analysis (factorial analysis and clasification) enables, under these conditions, to test and to produce strong and stable structures of the population of Bogota. This multidates analysis gives a multivariate indicator of the social composition of Bogota, which enables to adopt a global approach to study the trajectories of the districts in the social structure of the city.
