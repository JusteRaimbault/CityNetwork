Since the introduction of plague in Madagascar by europeans settlers, research on the Madagascar epidemiologic cycle has been focussing upon the comprehension of the transmission process between the main host, rats, and the secondary one, humans, via a vector, fleas. This process is now well known, thanks to the experimental method. Nowadays, research integrates a new approach, derived from artificial intelligence techniques and founded upon sciences of complexity, to analyse emergence, reemergence, conservation and diffusion of plague in its environment, in order to improve its control. The aim of our paper is to present this new approach of plague, replaced in its historical context, and based on multi-agent modeling.
