The aim of the paper is to better understand the geography of risk associated with French nuclear power plants. In this context, we look for the determinants of the social acceptance of risk according to geographical area. Concretely, we proceed in two steps : we first identify factors explaining the willingness to live in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant. Then we test whether the location choices are associated with differentiated perceptions of nuclear risk. The first model confirms the psycho-sociological approach of risk and highlights a positive link between the acceptance of nuclear risk and proximity of the residence to a nuclear plant : the NIMBY effect (Not In My Back Yard) is not found at the local level. The second model confirms the existence of a location bias that we interpret as a “neighborhood halo effect”.
