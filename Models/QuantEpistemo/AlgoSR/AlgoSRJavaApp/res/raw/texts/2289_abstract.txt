Many modellers use micro-level dynamics to study aggregate behaviours. Since this approach was pioneered in physics, I call it "Thermodynamic modelling". I revisit Sandersâ€™ comparison of synergetic with microsimulation methods and propose a new taxonomy of modellers. If "microsimulation modelling" is defined as "thermodynamic modelling with post-hoc alignment", then the synergetic and microsimulation paradigms are irreconcilable.
