This research focused on the economic transfers between a university and its local and regional setting, assessing how research and higher education activities contribute to local economic development. Interactions between university research and businesses are enhanced by spatial proximity, especially in the case of the largest universities within metropolitan regions. What are the effects of a smaller university associated with a medium-sized town? We studied the case of Pau University (UPPA), investigating all interactions between university research and the social, economic and cultural fabric of the area. The results show that Pau University has a real impact on the local region in several complementary ways. We identified an economic relationship corresponding to the transfer of knowledge and research methods and capability from Pau University to local businesses. Secondly, a strong component of the local cultural fabric is theÂ socio-cultural incorporation of scientific knowledge by the general public which serves as a resource for the entire region. The economic and cultural transfers mainly benefit to the local area, the urban zone around Pau, and by this way the University is a driving force behind local development.
