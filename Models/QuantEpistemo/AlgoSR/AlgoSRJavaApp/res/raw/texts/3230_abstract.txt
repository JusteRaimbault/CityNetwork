The frontier which currently divides Romania and Ukraine is due to the soviet decision to annex in 1940 North Bukovina and Bassarabia. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the romanians leaders tried to assert their rights to these lands, from which they had been despoiled. The question of the minorities was still at the centre of the debate, even if the real stake in the regular romanian-ukrainian negotiations seems actually to have been the “Snakes’ Island”, an unoccupied sandbank off the Danube Delta, which is close to territories of important oil resources.
