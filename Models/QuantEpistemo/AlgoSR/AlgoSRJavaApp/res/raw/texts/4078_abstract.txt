This paper is part of a collective program called "Nature in town", the aims of which aim are to reintroduce biophysical and environmental dimensions in urban spatial analysis. It focuses on the exploration of what types of criteria are convenient for such a description. Applied to the square grid GIS of Rouen built by Guermondâ€™ laboratory (MTG), it proposes to create new layers convenient for the purpose and submits the first results leading to a pertinent multiple scaled analysis of nature/society relationships in towns.
