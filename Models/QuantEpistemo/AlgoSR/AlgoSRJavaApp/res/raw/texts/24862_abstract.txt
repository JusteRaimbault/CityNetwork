The concept of greenways becomes relevant also in town and challenges researchers and practitioners. We asked about the construction of this field and its disciplinary origins. For that we have found the scientific literature on the subject over the past three decades and developed a bibliographic corpus has identified the main lexical richness. Our results show that ecosystem services and the inclusion of urban biodiversity increasingly structure the scientific field of urban greenway. Issues of ecological connectivity and reports of humans with nature in cities gradually enrich the issue of green belt. The latest writings particularly emphasize the origin and the multidisciplinary construction of the term, combining ecological, geographical and sociological notions.
