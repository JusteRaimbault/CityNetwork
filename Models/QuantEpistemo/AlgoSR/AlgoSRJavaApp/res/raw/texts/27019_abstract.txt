In the long time running from the 6th to the 21st centuries, the Turks have followed a Eurasian path from Central Asia to Western Europe, which turned these conquering nomadic people into a mobile people of migrants, anchored in an Anatolian national territory still difficult to sanctuarize. Turkey, whose demographic reshuffling was carried out through violence during the first part of the 20th century, sees its relative ethno-national homogeneity confronted with its maritime or continental frontier interfaces, and with people and neighbouring spaces inherited from the Ottoman Empire. Five graphic models, or chrono-chorotypes, allow to seize better, in closely associated space and time, the impact of the Turks between Europe and Asia, and the constraints and challenges which Turkey is facing in its Middle-Eastern and European environment.
