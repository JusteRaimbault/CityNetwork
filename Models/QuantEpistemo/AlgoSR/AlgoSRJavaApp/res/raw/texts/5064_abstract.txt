Periodically geographies split up into specialisations linked to scientific evolutions and ideological fluctuations. Consecutively, this splitting involves reunification's tentatives. In 1978-1980, at the beginning of the actual dismemberment phase, three axioms of geography (chorological, of situation, chronological) were suggested to substitute the unifying vidalian principles of geography. The basic mechanism of the axioms, the differenciation/differentiation, was correct, but the formulation of the chorological axiom was circular. It was reformulated in the shape of two chorological definitions of the geography's object serving as fundament to a logic. This was not an umpteenth tentative of geographies' reunification but a starting point to create a language allowing communication between geographies. The two other axioms, which refer to principles that are not suited to geographies, are abandoned.
