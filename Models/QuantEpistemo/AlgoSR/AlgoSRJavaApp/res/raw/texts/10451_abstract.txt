In France the “natural sites” policy have constitued a framework feature for landscape protection that was very used in rural areas. This article surveys how this policy, little known by the broad public and currently considered as not very effective, was used in the Pyrenees mountain. In fact this policy was a real milestone in the history of nature conservancy in these mountains. The article underlines that the “natural site” tool was rather relevant against the claims of industrious programs (dams and hydroelectric plants implementation) but it was less effective to monitoring the expansion of tourism and mountain urbanization. Moreover its implementation needed early a local acceptance : local decision makers and stakeholders looked for monitoring its enforcement. Nowadays this policy seems obsolete because of its weak management capacity and because sometimes it was canted by certain influential players. Its effectiveness depends of each local context. The working of the feature also reflects important differences due to its provincial bulk-heading. However the initiatives established around this feature enabled it to regulate the environmental and socioeconomic conflicts related to land use in mountain area. In fact mountain stakeholders and environmental players used “natural site” framework as a place of discussion and negotiation for mountain regional planning action. This experience benefits to further nature conservancy projects.
