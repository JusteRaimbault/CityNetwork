We define a family of statistical distributions using a common functional equation they satisfy; this family includes Pareto's distribution, the exponential distribution and a « contra-paretian » distribution. A very simple method for fitting these theoretical distributions to empirical data is briefly presented, and applied - with many details, and some success - to the rank-size distribution of french cities, during the 19th and 20th centuries, and its temporal evolution.
