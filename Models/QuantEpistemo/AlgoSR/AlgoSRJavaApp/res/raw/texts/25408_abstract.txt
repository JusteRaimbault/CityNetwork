This paper analyses the issues raised by the development of a type of Internet use based on communication between local elected representatives and the people. This usage intends to strengthen the exercise of citizenship in Senegal. Based on the analysis of public discourse on ICTs, and other experiences implemented in this field, it demonstrates that ‘e-Citizen’ is a poorly integrated phenomenon, and that it has to cope with several structural and incidental issues. The better involvement and interest of Senegalese stakeholders in this emerging issue within the development agenda need both a greater awareness and some actions based on local realities.
