Xynthia storm that swept France on 27 and 28 February 2010, resulted in embankment failures or submersions causing flooding of coastal areas reclaimed from the sea over time and today agricultural or urbanized. This catastrophic event raises the question of the management of flood risk in France, its effectiveness and limitations. Protection, embodied by the construction of dykes, is an old solution on coasts and along the rivers. Nevertheless, this solution does not go without problems and questions about its effectiveness. Thus, new preventive responses, aiming to “do the part of the water” are starting to be implemented. Prevention, whose central element is the control of land use, is itself often difficult to implement as local resistance is strong.
