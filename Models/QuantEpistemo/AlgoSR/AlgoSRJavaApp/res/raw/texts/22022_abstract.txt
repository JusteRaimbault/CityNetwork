The territorial vulnerability analysis aims to identify, characterize and prioritize areas from which vulnerability is generated and disseminated in a territory. Risk prevention should give priority to these areas because they can disrupt, jeopardize or interrupt the functioning and development of the territory.The approach was developed under the research program entitled "Information System and Risks in the Metropolitan District of Quito”. The article aims to explain this approach, based on the identification of strategic areas of the territory and the analysis of their vulnerability, and the methodology leading to the cartography of Quito’s territorial vulnerability.
