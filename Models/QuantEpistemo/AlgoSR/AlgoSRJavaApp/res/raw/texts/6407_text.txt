Maps in India were once a rare artifact. Although this trend is changing, theyÂ still remain pretty scarce. Moreover, the development of automatic cartography tools available through internet tend to hide what remains a lack of knowledge of space. A good example of this situation is the census map website (http://www.censusindiamaps.net/), which, despite its richness, leaves the reader his own, without any explanation, to figure out what might be the spatialization of census data.
The atlas presented here aims to help the reader go beyond this simple presentation of data by offering an analysis of South Indian territory. For this purpose, we used the SIFP database, which georeferenced the 1991 census data both at village and town level. To produce readable maps, which include more than 75.000 units, advanced mapping methodology was used. We have selected data most likely to interrest the widest possible audience and ordered them into 5 categories: Demography, Gender, SC/ST population, Economy, Agriculture.
