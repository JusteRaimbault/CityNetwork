The lack of data and the persistent segmentation of spatial mobility approach handicap the understanding of the logics of urban settlement in Senegal. Focusing on the various forms of spatial mobility (international migrations, internal migrations, intra-urban mobilities) in the approach of urban change, we propose a new reading of the recent settlement in Dakar. Since the 1980s, Dakar urban area has been significatively concerned with both demographic and housing transformations. The landscape of the city is marked by the consolidation of the built-up areas, the verticalisation of the housing environment and urban sprawl. These transformations take place in a new context of urban populating in which the role of demographic factors requires a careful revision. The internal migrations which have been a key to the growth of the city and its spatial extension seem to be less determining than the natural growth of the urban population. Our aim in this paper is to stress on the demographic redistribution which takes place at the intra-urban scale and to question the functions of residential spaces in the dynamics of urban settlement.
