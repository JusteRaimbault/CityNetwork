This paper deals with the role played by Geography within the French university missions in Brazil in the 1930s, considered as fundamental for the development of local universities, particularly on the side of human sciences. I will focus mainly on the work of Pierre Deffontaines: crossing both French and Brazilian primary sources, and comparing the existing work produced in France and Brazil, both by historians and geographers, I interrogate the documents on the scientific networks of that time and on the political, cultural and didactic stakes of this example of international circulation of knowledge. Moreover, my aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of this crossing of geographical knowledge both for Brazilian university and social sciences in France.
