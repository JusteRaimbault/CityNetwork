The reason why it is so difficult to build some operational framework to sustainable development lies in the fact that sustainable development never happens out of the blue. This paper tries to figure out how such a framework can be imagined from three criteria: the type of governance, the type of sustainability and definition of the resources. It supposes abandoning the unique and universal sustainable developmentâ€™s myth, and to replace it by plural sustainable developments. European Union is a good target to focus on in order to define those sustainable developments, since the EU proposes an European strategy for sustainable development that European countries, regions or local governments convert into heterogeneous policies.
