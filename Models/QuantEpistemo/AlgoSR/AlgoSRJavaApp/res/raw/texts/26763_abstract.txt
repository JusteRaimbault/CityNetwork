Territories are increasingly interdependent. In this context, technical networks affect directly the well-being of the people and the smooth functioning of societies. So, in a risk context, it seems relevant to study strengths and weaknesses of technical networks. To this end, several approaches can be applied. However, for different reasons, structural analysis, which study technical networks pattern, are increasingly used. Risk studies do not escape this trend. Nevertheless, in current structural analyses, spatial dimension is often neglected, even though technical networks are actually spatial infrastructures. This research develops therefore methods to take this spatial dimension into account. Results highlight the criticality of peripheral components (nodes) and call into question criticality of central components. A new methodology has been therefore developed for identifying critical scenarios.
