The malaria remains a public health problem in spite of the implemented means. Among the existing information related to malaria prevention in the Gabon, there has a gap concerning the colonial period. Through a synthesis of the organization of this malaria prevention for 5-14 years, the aim of this study is to fill this lack in this target population and to supply information of decision-making support. In spite of the gaps in the data, the use of archives reveals that the activities of malaria prevention are differently led by the concerned institutions: the Indigenous Medical Care first, and the General Service of Mobile Hygiene and Disease Prevention then. Both departments had same kind of functioning problems, but the second focused on preventive activities. They evaluate the chemotherapy program in school, by measuring splenic index in june and october (at the beginning and at the end of scholar year). This index was approximately two times less in june than in october in most regions. In addition, the more regions are far from coast, the more the index is high. This program result on pupils absence fall’s and was completed by imagocid and anti-larval control. Children aged 0-5 who also participated to this distribution can’t be controlled because they parents don’t often bring them at pediatric nursing’s. The General department of mobile hygiene and prophylaxis furthermore, organized a survey, at the end of colonization, to update some epidemiological information’s and the geography of endemicity.
