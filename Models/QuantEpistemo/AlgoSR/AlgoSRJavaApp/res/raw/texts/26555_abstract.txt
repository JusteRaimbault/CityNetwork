This article described space and time variations of temperature and comfort indexes like humidex and heat index in eastern Maghreb. These indexes increase during the late morning and afternoon but decrease on the evening, thus improving thermal comfort. The THW Index incorporates the wind speed parameter. This index is lower than the previous two in the afternoon because the sea breeze speed is around 5m/s. Temperatures and thermal comfort indexes recorded in daytime are colder in coastal than in continental areas. Coastal area temperatures and thermal comfort indexes are deeply dependent on the sea-breeze diurnal cycle. During the hot season, see-breeze improves thermal comfort in a better way than sirocco wind.
