This article analyses the actorsâ€™ speeches, their ways to convince and the strategies of farmers and local officials concerned by the National Rural Development Plan - called PDRN in France - between 2001 and 2007. The outcomings highlight a perception of an unequal distribution and regionalization (localization in French regions), which sometimes lacks of consistency and undermines the program. The increase in the number of individual strategies is apparently the unintended result of this policy. The parties who pretty much depend on subsidies adopt various strategies and attitudes in order to keep their activities and income. Farmers have mainly a short term view on the prosperity of their farm. They hardly plan their future ahead and their working habits. One of the reasons put forward by the farmers, is a lack of communication networks.
