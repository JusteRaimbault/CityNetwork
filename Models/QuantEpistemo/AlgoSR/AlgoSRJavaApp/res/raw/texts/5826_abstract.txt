This research examines the ability of a usual indicator, the density of population, to apprehend the urban structures and processes. The socio-residential organisation of the agglomeration of Hamburg (Germany) was studied using two traditional and a priori irreconcilable methods of analysis: firstly, the factor analysis which allowed the construction of a "socio-spatial aggregation" of the districts of Hamburg, and a diachronic comparison processed according to the method of Y. AHMAVAARA (1954); secondly, a study of the densities through some traditional models. Indeed, their contribution to an improvement of the comprehension of urban ecology is not very important. The approach of B. KORZYBSKI (1976), while going beyond a simple adjustment of the relation between the densities and the distance from the centre of the city, gives an additional viewpoint to the study of the densities by introducing a social dimension. Thanks to a transformation of the physical space, the author proposes to replace the effective spreading of the city, which mingles a social component and the influence of the physical setting, by a spatial arrangement having only a social content. This form of "regularization" authorizes diachronic comparisons like those carried out between cities which could be very different.
