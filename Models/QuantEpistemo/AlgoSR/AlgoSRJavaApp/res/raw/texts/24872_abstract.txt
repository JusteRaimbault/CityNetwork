The spatial influence of cities can be apprehended from the way in which innovation diffuses, from the presence of modern and “rare” or out-of-the-ordinary activities, and from the networks formed by companies operating a number of sites. The analysis of these diffusion patterns casts light on the spatial dynamics in Tunisia in recent times, on the explicative models, on the changes occurring in the urban hierarchy, and on the inexorable decline of certain centres in favour of others. This article sets out to analyse the diffusion of innovative, modern and out-of-the-ordinary activities and their business networks between 1997 and 2004. It shows that the spatial diffusion observed is coherent with a hierarchical pattern on national scale, while on regional scale it is proximity that has the greatest influence. Further to this, the city of Sousse appears to be strengthening its position in relation to the second city, Sfax, while the coastal zone continues to be favoured by these processes, prefiguring the Tunisia of tomorrow.
