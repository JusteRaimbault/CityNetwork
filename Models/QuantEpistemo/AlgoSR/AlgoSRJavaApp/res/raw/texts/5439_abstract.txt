This paper is an answer to N. MathieuÂ´s paper published in the same issue. In the first place, the very notion of exclusion and its origins are examined. Then the relations between urban territory and exclusion are put under question, in particular in the works of the Chicago school of sociology. Finally a research agenda is set up, regarding factors and processes of social exclusion in post-industrial metropoles.
