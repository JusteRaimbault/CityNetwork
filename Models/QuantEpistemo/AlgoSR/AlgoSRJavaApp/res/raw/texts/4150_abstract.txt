Taking the example of oil producing cities of Colombia, some links between reconstruction of times and modification of geographical spaces are established. In a social geography viewpoint, the consequences of theses changes related with social inequalities are investigated. It is possible to identify time spaces, some of them only sketches, other very strongly defined: oil time spaces linked to globalization, time spaces of the “travelling” upper classes, times spaces of the oil-workers, time spaces of the more popular social classes living in the suburbs, the very fluctuating time spaces of guerrilla warfare, festive time spaces now become more commercial, time spaces of speculators thwarting urban planning, etc.
