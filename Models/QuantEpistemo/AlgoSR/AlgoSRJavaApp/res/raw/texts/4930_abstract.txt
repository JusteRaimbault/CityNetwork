The need to define synthetic indices useful for comparing the socio-economic profiles of areas is a major topic of interest in many fields of urban and regional analysis. Related to it is the need to address the problem of the spatial variability of phenomena. In this respect, the notions of heterogeneity, dispersion, disequilibrium and the complementary notions of homogeneity, concentration and equilibrium are particularly relevant. In many practical cases, however, the use of these notions can generate confusion and difficulties of communication because of their definitions. This papers aims to show that the several definitions which can be found in the literature refer to a same underlying concept and their differences are mainly due to the nature of data and measurement approaches. The paper is articulated into two parts. Part 1 discusses some main definitions of the above notions and illustrates the statistical indices associated with them. Part 2 presents an application of the proposed indices to the spatial distribution of jobs, by economic sector, in Piedmont.
