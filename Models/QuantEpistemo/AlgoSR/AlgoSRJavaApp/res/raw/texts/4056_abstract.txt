Since the geographical information system revolution of the mid-1980s, there has been a rapid growth in the number of spatially referenced databases. Data management, within these new systems, immediately took up a large place, but today, as argued Stan Openshaw, "analysis is no longer an optional activity". Nevertheless, we may keep in mind that spatial data have very special properties, that create a need for spatial data analysis and spatial. Furthermore, it may be argued that, in a GIS context, user's needs are mainly of a data exploratory nature. Yet, data-driven tools can be hardly found within classical GIS software, when they may be available at all.
