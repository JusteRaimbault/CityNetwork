In qualitative research, a methodology is more then a description of the techniques and methods to be used. It's the place of an ethical reflection on the way "one directs one's conduct" as a re-searching person. A qualitative method always incorporates a dimension transforming it into an intellectual and existential posture. Such a definition of method as posture allows one to seize the "boundaries of trust" of qualitative research, of "the techniques and sources" which it mobilizes. Constructing objectivity thus implies clarifying the different forms of a global social experience the researcher meets in his field work.
