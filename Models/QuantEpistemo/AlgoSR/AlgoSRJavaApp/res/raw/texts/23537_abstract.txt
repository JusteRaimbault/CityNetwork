The space-structural changes in Chinese megacities produce a variety of temporarily uncertain surfaces. Intensity, duration and kind of initiated interim uses have different extensive effects on the local hydrologic situation. The article in hand aims to bringing together findings from the special fields of hydrology and city/ landscape morphology. In the first chapter, the impacts of urbanization on groundwater and the specific role of abandoned sites in this research context will be shortly described. The second part will give an overview of ‘typical’ abandoned sites and situations within a mega-urban context on the basis of different examined urban units. The present study should carry out the interdependencies between self regulation mechanisms (in terms of interim uses) and their effects on the water resources as well as the underlying dynamic processes. The discussion at the end transfers the findings from microscale to the mega-urban context and thus allows conclusions about the overall urban development and the resulting vulnerability of megacity Guangzhou.
