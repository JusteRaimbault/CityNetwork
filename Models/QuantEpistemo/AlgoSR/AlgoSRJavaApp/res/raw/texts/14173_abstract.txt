We present an analysis of the particle accelerator families from the cyclotron to the proton collider LHC at CERN. Different properties of these families characterize a complex system. Jumps of technologic innovation provide very important leaps of projectile energies. Chronology of these jumps could be explained by a log periodic law. Such a law succeeds in analyzing the chronologies of primates, rodents, equidae and, even, financial crashes. Acceleration and deceleration of evolution define a critical epoch Tc. We conclude that new technologies are necessary in the future for the survival of the High Energy Physics.
