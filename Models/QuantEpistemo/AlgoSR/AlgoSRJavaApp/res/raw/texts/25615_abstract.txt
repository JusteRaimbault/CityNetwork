The agrarian sector has been strongly affected during the last few decades due to the liberalization of markets and the decrease in State intervention. In the case of the cultivation of sugar cane and the sugar agro-industry that have been strongly affected by these changes, different strategies have been adopted, varying from one region to another. In this research, we will study the case of Los Reyes Valley in the State of Michoac√°n, in which the cultivation of sugar cane has been continuous since Colonial times. However, in the nineties, the export crops of blackberry have gained terrain progressively at the expense of sugar cane, and this has caused multiple economic and social changes as well as changes in the landscapes. We will study the impact of the cultivation of blackberries in the valley and the resiliency of sugar cane in view of this new production, profitable but surely ephemeral.
