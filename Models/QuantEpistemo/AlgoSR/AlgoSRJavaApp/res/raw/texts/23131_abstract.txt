Agent-based simulation offers multiple advantages when dealing with complex phenomena like pedestrian movement, characterised by a possibly large number of locally interacting entities. The main goal of this article is to illustrate this key point, from the simulation of pedestrian movements in confined designed spaces. It specifically focuses on the formalisation of space and of agents populating it. The model developed, MAGE, allows exploring the role played by local interactions on the global dynamic of the designed spatial system.
