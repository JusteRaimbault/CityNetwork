What do Brasília and Jérusalem have in common besides being world capital- cities ? What unites them is the cultural amalgam and the counterposition of the weight of history – ancient, strong and present in Jérusalem and recent, weak and still "absent" in Brasília. Within this panorama, the question we are interested in discussing is why somebody, an ordinary citizen, who has the chance of choosing where to live, would decide to settle in Brasilia, of all places in Brazil, or in Jérusalem, of all places in Israel. Starting off from the principle that the residents of both cities are "citizens of the world", we put forward the hypothesis that in this decision there is a built-in will to chart the cultural history of a territory, or rather, to be an actor in charge of the multiculturalism of a territory living its day-to-day life.
