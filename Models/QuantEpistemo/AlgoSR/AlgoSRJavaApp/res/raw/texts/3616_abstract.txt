A GIS, with an original database, shows the spatial effects of ligneous cover dynamics. Spatial pattern depends on either biological or social factors, according to a continuous or discontinuous organisation. Several hypotheses upon driving factors - as grazing, burning and cutting- are put to test, by a stepwise method, using different functions of GIS. Landscape management by farmers of Causse MÃ©jan is sustainable in few cases.
