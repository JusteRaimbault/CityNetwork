The paper presents in a theoritical way a method using models which attempts to quantify the architectural and the urban homogeneity. The models exposed are two indexes named morphological deviation and rate of irregularity. Those indexes lead to a definition of urban fabric as a meta-system. Form is defined as the combination between shape and relative position. The shape is obtained by the discretisation of the objects' outline and its relative position is determinated by a Delaunay's triangulation.
