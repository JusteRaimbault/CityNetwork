Recent developments in interactive and dynamic cartography and development of Internet technologies are largely contributed to increase the number of interactive atlases on Internet. With client/server technologies and vector formats for Internet, itâ€™s now possible to deploy rapidly interactive web-atlases. In this methodological article, we expose a simple and effective approach based on C#, ASP.Net and SVG to product interactive atlases on Internet. This approach is very useful for two reasons: the cartographic production is very simple and fast, and the development of interactive and dynamic mapping functions is facilitated and almost unlimited.
