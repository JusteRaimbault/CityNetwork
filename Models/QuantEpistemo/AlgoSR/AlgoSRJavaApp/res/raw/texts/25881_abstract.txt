During the 1990s, ethnic conflicts in the Western Balkans have led to a fragmentation and a recombination of territories and populations mainly around the major ethnic groups. Based on a consociational approach and a pragmatic position of bringing the war to an end, the International Community interventions that followed have reinforced the ethnicisation of territories, societies and politics. While there is much research being conducted to highlight the limits of such an approach, there is still too little work devoted to possible alternatives. The aim of this paper is to theoretically and critically discuss to what extent new political and social dialogue may emerge in former Yugoslavia through cross-border cooperation (promoted in particular by the EU) and to consider the possible links of this with interethnic reconciliations.
