This article examines the use of a research method coming from Visual studies (photo elicitation interview) in a particular geographical field research (everyday landscapes discussed in terms of resident experience). The paper argues that photo elicitation interview is an appropriate technique to produce a different kind of information by driving informants in a thinking process about their relationship with their everyday landscapes. First of all, methodological insights and practical considerations about using photographs in interviews are presented and discussed. Whereafter, the paper shows, based on concrete examples, how this technique is able to promote more direct and stronger involvement of the informants in the research process and also provide access to a quantitatively and qualitatively different information to that obtained in conventional interviews.
