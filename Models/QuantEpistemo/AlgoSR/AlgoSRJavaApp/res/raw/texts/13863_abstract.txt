The deployment of the growth of the Great Tunis, over its immediate zone of influence, was carried on tardily and extensively in the absence of a functionality set up on the spatial division of labor and of a quality differential adequately settled. The operating processes within the peri-urban and rural neighbouring zones, together with the small and average-sized towns in the neighbourhood, 30-40 km end 60-70 km from the capital, have created a large integrated zone of metropolitan solidarity in the North-East areas : those of farming intensification and dairy basins, employment basins as well as two metropolitan bases of operations : One is the industrial harbor (Bizerte and Menzel Bourguiba), the other is a tourist one (Nabeul and Hammamet). The latter are related to new demographic tendencies, to the land market pressure, mainly, to the conversion of the productive system under the increasing effect of globalization, those processes infer the “emerging metropolity” of Tunis and explain the territory recomposition of the North-East of Tunisia. However, tourism and industry are no longer the only vectors of this opening up and of this metropolity. The new choices and projects on the sport-congress-culture and logistic and transport activities will contribute to strengthen the Tunis metropolitan zone of solidarity and to extend it to the South through a metropolitan trunk road assuming the junction of the North-East to the Sahel of Sousse. These two sets will shape a triangle representing the most competitive space of the country around a central metropolitan zone modernized, rehabilitated and more open. This triangle will be reinforced towards the South by evident master positions. That foresees, then, a deep reorganization of the Tunisian space in witch this competitive triangle, undergoing massive changes today, would take more and more land.
