Large areas of western Europe are still covered with atlantic heaths. The writer studies the distribution of these heaths in regard the leading ecological factors. At first, characterictics of bioclimates and soils are evoked. Then, consequences oh human activities are made clear to the mind because, for a long time , the heath formed the major basis of the whole agrarian system. In conclusion, the writer place in a prominent position some gradients and considers that the determinism is on the dependance of scales (spatial and temporal). Although this one is not easy to define, man plays a preponderant action in the heaths birth, their localisation and their evolution.
