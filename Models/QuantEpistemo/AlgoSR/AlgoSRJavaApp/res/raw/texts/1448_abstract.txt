Following the major changes which occurred in the " Camargue gardoise " during the sixties and the seventies, and because of the outdated " Traité des Marais " which was regulating the collective management of water levels, the economic actors dealing with water concerns have been developing individualistic policies. Water has become the origin of numerous conflicts of serious consequences concerning resources and natural spaces. The implementation of an environmental chart and of a " SAGE " in the early nineties was the outset of a comeback to a collective form of water management.However, water is still a long way from being looked-upon as a vector of territorial construction thanks to collective agreements about projects dealing with water."
