Inspired by Newton's law of gravitation, gravity models appeared in geography more than one century ago. For about fourty years, non-euclidean spaces have been of current use in geography. We know also that riemannian spaces are the formal apparatus of General Relativity. In Einstein's theory (1915), gravitation is nothing but space-time curvature. All along this paper, we shall try to extend gravity models by substituting for the Newton's law a relativistic model based on a riemannian space. We also try to answer the different kinds of problems raised by our theory : for instance, discontinuity of space, non symmetric matrices of distances, non-constant curvature, locally non euclidean riemannian spaces, etc.
