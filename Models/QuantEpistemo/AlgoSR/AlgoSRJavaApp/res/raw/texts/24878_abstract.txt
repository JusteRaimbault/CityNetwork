This paper—by means of an agent-based model called “LivingChristaller”—explores the possibilities for the emergence of the regular spatial organisation of the centres of production proposed by Walter Christaller for two distinct populations (the producers of goods and the consumers of these goods), and on the sole basis of the working hypothesis formulated by the author.
