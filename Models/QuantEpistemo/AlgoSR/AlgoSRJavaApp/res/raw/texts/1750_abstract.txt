Functional rehabilitation corresponds to intentional evolution of the functions of the building chosen by public actors in order to be revalorized and considered as tangible heritage. During all the 20th century, the use of monuments and traditional houses built in the heart of Uzbek pre-colonial urban areas are being changed, selected and invented by conquering States in order to answer ideological, economic and social needs. Since 1991, Uzbekistan is independent and functional rehabilitation establishes itself as a genuine tool for public city planning, working in the name of historic heritage preservation and, particularly, tourism development, gradually creating the urban space of Central Asia. But the reluctance of the locals, sensitive to the sacredness of the places, reminds us that they are holders of values in contradiction with those that the State proposes. The pre-colonial neighborhoods, considered as places of power and not as social spaces, are the mirror-image of political domination, which carries on.
