Despite its enduring fundamental relationships with space in contemporary societies, geographers have rarely concerned themselves with the family. This article seeks to demonstrate the relevance of a geographical study of family by focusing on the case of Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece), and by developing two related approaches to the subject. The first treats the family as a domestic group. Processes of family formation and the makeup of households in Southern Europe – strongly institutionalized marriage, low fertility rates, delayed departure from the parental home, etc. – remain very different from those in Northern and Central European countries. These persisting peculiarities call into question the theory of a geographical convergence of European family structures. The second approach focuses on residential patterns of Kinship. Southern Europe strong families are localized, and high geographical proximity between parents and children has relevant consequences on mobility patterns and urban structures. In conclusion, it is argued that the persistance of this Southern European family model can be traced to a peculiar division of labour between the State, the Family and the Market that allowed southern European countries to cope with a rapid process of urbanisation during the latter half of the twentieth century
