Defining what renewing territories really means proves difficult as it rests upon both countable values allowing socio-economic ranking as well as intangible values associated with city dwellers’ distinct representations and experience of urban spaces. Indeed, the values foregrounded through various urban operations vary greatly - values of change are shaping up actions and images related to the Euralille operation, the Neptune project in Dunkerque is grounded upon methodological values, while cliché and shifting values fall short of characterising the Euroméditerranée operation. Values, however heterogeneous, nurture conflicts, make up narratives and legitimise political figures, thus lying at the heart of the operational renewal process.
