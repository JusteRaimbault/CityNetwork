Managing cold water in collective dwellings has evolved in France with the implementation of recent regulations. This paper explores one such evolution, that is, the generalisation of individual meters. Examples of arguments favouring this are that they will help avoiding wasteful use of water, they will permit consumer responsabilisation, and they will ensure greater equity. However, technical, economic, and social problems appear. Relations between inhabitants and various water management actors are transformed because the circulation of water in collective dwellings reveals the complexity of everyday life.
