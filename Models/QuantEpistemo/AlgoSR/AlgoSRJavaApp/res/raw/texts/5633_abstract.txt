The Eurovision song contest pretends to be the oldest demonstration of european cultural unity, celebrating in 2005 its 50 years. Far from being only a kitsch show, the european song contest ask a certain amount of questions about the cultural frontiers in Europe. Can someone be european while singing a song and, however, be rejected from the European Union, cultural, economical and political space? Is the european space perfectly homoneous or are we in front of an aggregate of regional subdivisions put together? Has the device of the European Union “Unity in diversity” always been with us?
