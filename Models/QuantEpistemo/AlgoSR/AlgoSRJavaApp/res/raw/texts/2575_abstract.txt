With each new restructuring of the system of Higher Education in France, the scientific community is asked to undertake studies and offer reflections on the present state of the system as a whole and its possible future developments. By the time this phase is well under way, interest in the project has begun to wane.  Although the latest round of announcements of university facilities (U 2000) has been completed, the overall results have yet to be determined, quantified and analysed.  Using data from the DEP (the French Statistical Board of Education), this study aims to give priority to the situation at the regional level, and to describe the main features of access to educational facilities and the major changes recorded for the primary types of Higher Education during the past fifteen years.
