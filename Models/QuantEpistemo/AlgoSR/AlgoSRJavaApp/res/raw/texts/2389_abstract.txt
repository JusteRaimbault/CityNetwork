The multi-agents systems developped within the framework of distributed artificial intelligence represent a promising tool for modelling spatial dynamic. Using such an approach involves a reflexion on the objects and more especially on the geographical levels which have to be taken in account. In this article, we present and compare two simulation’s models for describing an agricultural conquest’s process. In one model the agents are defined at the level of individuals, as actors of change. In the other, the agents represent the spatial aggregates for which aggregated mechanisms of transformation are defined.
