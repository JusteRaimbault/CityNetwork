The Loire river is much less developed and artificialized than other big French rivers. However, its catchment basin planning has been at the heart of significant controversies for the last decades. The opposition between developers and environmental protectors has been strong but profitable insofar as it has been helping the transition from a technician watercourse management method – which prioritizes watercourse control through important developments regardless of their environmental effects – to an environmental management method – which strives to articulate planning while preserving the natural balances existing in hydrosystems. Studying the Loire catchment basin may thus highlights the rise of a new and more environment conscious watercourse management method.
