The Devices of Complexity. Cultural geography provides an interpretation of urban reality, which identifies it with a complex of signs. These signs have the fundamental purpose of introducing order and sense into complex social structures. The only way in which a complex artificial world can work is to put it under the control of intelligent human behaviour. The permanence of social order and its complexity is connected with the possibility of translating them into a language accessible to individuals. But all this has a limit. There are some places in the world which cannot be described completely because they cannot be understood completely. They are places in which our bodies can just live. These places are cities. Cities are places whose increasing complexity stimulate the man to develop new languages, theories and works of art.
