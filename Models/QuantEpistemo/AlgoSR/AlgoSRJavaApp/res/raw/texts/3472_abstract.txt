Likeness and proximity are studied in the particular context of geographical discontinuity, in both clustered (bounded) and continuous spaces. First, likeness and proximity are linked: likeness could be spatial and/or social; moreover, social structures influence proximities, and, conversely, proximity influence not only structures, but flows as well. Two options are available when measuring likeness of places at close range. One is couple-of-places-analysis; other is a particular smoothing method. This method allows computing a "heterogeneity vector" / "directed heterogeneity index", useful when mapping discontinuities. Despite existing varieties of geographical discontinuities are more or less sensitive to time and spatial scale change, morphology of discontinuities is an important matter: form of the discontinuity influences the development of the circumscribed system.
