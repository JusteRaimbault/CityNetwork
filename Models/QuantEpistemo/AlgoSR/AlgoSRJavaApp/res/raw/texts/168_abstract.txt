The Internet has revolutionised the many ways electronic data is distributed, stored and presented. The Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW) in particular have introduced new methods for the cartographic community to display and distribute map information. In conjunction with a wider audience, the Internet and WWW are presenting new commercial opportunities. The technical limitations for the current implementation of the Internet are slowing the process, yet are being rapidly rectified by the IT industry. This paper aims to highlight some of these problems, along with a brief appraisal of the mapping industry on the WWW. Two examples of organisations utilising the WWW for distributing their data are also discussed.
