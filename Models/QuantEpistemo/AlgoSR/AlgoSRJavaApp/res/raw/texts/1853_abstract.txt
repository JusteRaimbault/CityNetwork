In Haïti, an original scheme is offered by the rural environment : the share of communal sections in «habitations». The notion of habitation which is a basic form of the haytian rural space has a double meaning : it is first and foremost a physico-natural space which is limited by the communal sections ; it is also the reflection of an entire lifestyle. The subdivisions Habitations/Lakou which constitute the micro-organization of rural space confer to haytian reality a socio-cutural dimension which has to be the basis of all spatial planning policy.
