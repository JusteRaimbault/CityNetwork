The OSIRIS-Inondation tool was developed in the European Commission’s OSIRIS FP5-IST project. It is now used by several dozen localities in France to generate their Local Emergency Plan and apply action plans during training exercises or real flooding incidents (crisis planning/management). A multi-hazard version of the system has now been developed for helping the mayor and his/her technical services to elaborate, analyze and compare damage and crisis scenarios for natural or technological hazards. OSIRIS helps these stakeholders to evaluate and forecast the exact impact of an imagined or real catastrophe on their locality and is interfaced with external information sources (forecasts) and wider-scale decision-making centres (Prefectures, military zones, etc.). The platform (designed by and for field-based stakeholders) is based on an object-oriented data model and web technologies, enabling it to (i) evolve as a function of the feedback received and (ii) adapt itself to a local authority’s needs and constraints. In addition to the direct threat to local facilities during a crisis and the non-structural measures to be taken in an emergency, ongoing research work is seeking to better take account of induced risks (network crashes and evacuations) and scenarios which focus on mitigating structural vulnerability. In parallel with the immediate provision of decision support services (crisis preparation and management), OSIRIS helps build a hazard knowledge base by capitalizing on all the available digital information (regulation, action files, photo libraries, etc.) over the long term.
