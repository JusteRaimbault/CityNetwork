Economic studies on micro-territorial settings have received growing attention in the social sciences, highlighting the complexity of social and economic mechanisms in macro-economic dynamics. The aim of this paper is to analyse the spatial influences on the growth of the value-added per capita in the Italian local labour market systems.  We use the traditional non-parametric shift and share technique with a spatial weights matrix. In the end we apply a Jacobs’ approach to estimate the influences of externalities about the dynamics of the value-added.
