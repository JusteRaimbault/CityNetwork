The evolution of the urban systems shall pass different stages. The firs is the formation of hole system than the conformity to the rank-size rule is improving. The second is the transition from the quasi-amorphous state to the quasi-crystalline state than the conformity to the rank-size rule is getting worse, but the conformity to the central place theory is improving. The relativistic central place theory makes interdependent the spacing of the central places and their size. The attractor of the evolution of the central places systems is the state of isostatic equilibrium – the complete compensation of the deviation from the theory predictions by the spacing of the central places. The size of the central places is determined by the another way than in the classical theory. The type of Christaller’s hierarchy – the K – is depending on the degree of the urbanisation and is to change during the evolution of the central systems. So that the virtual hierarchies K=5 and K=6 which are not conforming to any optimization principle do exist. Than the urban population is below 50% K=3, if it is between 50% and 60% - K=4, for 70 – 80% K=5, if it is about 90% - K=6 and the extreme quantity of the urban population – 100% is corresponding to K=7. The evolution of the central places systems is closely related with the transition of urban systems from one Gibbs stage of urbanisation to another and with the evolution of transport networks. Many national and regional urban systems were studied in order to test these statements and the results were satisfactory.
