In the Lagdo region in the North-Cameroon, migrant peasants then the Agro-industrial society of the Benoue (SAIB) installed in 2000 at a strategic place for the realization of its rice and fruit cultivation project, should enhance the downstream hydroelectric dam.. As a result, this facility induced the departure of 36% of the farmers in this irrigated area. The occupation of the peasants site by the company awakened a series of land conflicts between the different actors (farmers, SAIB, elites, new generation, lamido) that have long been neglected by the decision makers. Also, the tenure insecurity has blocked the agricultural activities of SAIB and provokes the abandon of theirs equipments and the plant material in the bush. This not solved conflict by authorities amplifies the alliance between the state administration and traditional leaders, which effect lays on the identity withdrawal and the lack of interest of the population towards the agricultural development project, with the risk of asphyxia in the region.
