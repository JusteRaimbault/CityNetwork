What could be the role of regional and urban planning in reducing greenhouse gas emissions? For some planners, the climate change mitigation is an opportunity to implement policies that they promote since a long time, but whose implementation is fickle: smart growth, public transportation priority and so on. For some scientists, regional and urban planning could only have very indirect and modest effects on greenhouse gas emissions. A scientific literature review on this topic is presented. Many researchers have described and analyzed the links between local or regional characteristics and energy consumption. The present article shows that planning could only indirectly and modestly contribute to climate change mitigation but contributes however to the social acceptance of energy transition.
