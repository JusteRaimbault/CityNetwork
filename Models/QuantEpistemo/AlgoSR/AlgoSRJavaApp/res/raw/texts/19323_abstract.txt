Malagasy biodiversity conservation policies have experienced a renewal since the 1990s as a result of the integration of local modes of governance in relation to access to and management of natural resources. Local contracting is expressed by the re-designation of regulated areas dedicated to biodiversity protection as conservation territories in which local knowledge and practices are recognized. The resource access governance mechanisms, put into place by the project for Transferring the Management of Renewable Natural Resources (TGRNR) designate new territories for which different groups, organized into grassroots communities (COBA), do not have the same rights of resource access, control and use. Our study examines four cases of contractualized forest management (GCF) situated in the “corridor” of the northern forested uplands: two on the western slopes in Betsileo country, and two on the eastern slope in Tanala country. These resource management transfers are recent, dating from 2003. They are examples of local environmental governance that aim to give neighboring communities, in a legitimate and representative manner, the opportunity to address the main factors contributing to resource degradation. These territorial mechanisms for biodiversity conservation interfer with existing social and territorial forms of organization, which raises questions about their appropriation in a local context. Moreover, the lack of training in the new regulatory techniques, both social and territorial, is a cause for dysfunctional management of biodiversity conservation, which hampers community-based resource management.
