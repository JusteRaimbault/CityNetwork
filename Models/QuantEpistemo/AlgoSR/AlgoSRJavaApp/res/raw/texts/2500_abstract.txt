This paper puts forward a literary summary on the time issue in the world of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The insertion of time into spatial databases appears more and more to be the condition for their optimal historicity management. This one is directly linked to updating methods which are themselves dependent on the way in which the information was modelled in the database. Actually, if the object-oriented approach can be seen as the optimal solution to ensure a good spatio-temporal databases management, we can also say that the majority of the current suggestions are still built on the classical distinction from the (geo)relational model between spatial and thematic informations.
