This paper argues that there may be considerable advantages to including indicators within geodemographic systems that represent workplace-based characteristics and the commuting linkages between areas. Using the regional example of Yorkshire and Humberside in northern England, we indicate how a suite of workplace-based and residence-workplace linkage variables relating to the labour market can be assembled and used alongside a suite of residence-based (or demand) variables to generate a new area classification. Spatial interaction models are calibrated to derive some of the variables that take into account area self-containment and catchment size.
