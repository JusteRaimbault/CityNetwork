This paper discusses the relations between nation-states through the example of football (soccer). More precisely, we analyse from a geopolitical point of view the introduction in the main European championships of quotas limiting the number of non-national players, as well as the absence or presence of a policy of integration for players of foreign origins in national selections. To illustrate this, we adopt a historical perspective to better understand the ways through which soccer, and sports more generally, have become instrumentalised by nation-states in the context of the two World Wars. Moreover, we analyse recent developments regarding quota policies in relation to the emergence of the European Union, with emphasis on the permeability and displacement of frontiers for the free movement of professional football players. We then move to consider the national issue in football by showing that, if the European nation-states tried to homogenise their territories, in order to improve instrumentally the performance, naturalised players were integrated into national teams from the 1920â€™s onwards. However, not all nation-states adopted the same policy. This is shown through the example of the differential integration of players from colonised territories, as well as by the comparison between France and Germany. Finally, in the light of the concepts of denationalisation and transnationalism, we analyse the latest developments in the use of naturalised players by countries such as Qatar and Togo.
