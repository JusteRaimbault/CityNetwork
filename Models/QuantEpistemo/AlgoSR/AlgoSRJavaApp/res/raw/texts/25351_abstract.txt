In this article a cellular automaton model is proposed to analyze the effect of different kinds of proximity in urban growth process. Simulations showed that the modification of three variables (built areas density, Euclidean distance from each cell to road network and network distance to urban center) is sufficient to make different typical patterns emerge, and that these patterns correspond to different ways to organize urban space. This method improves understanding of the role of proximities in urban dynamics, in order to build models based on spatial and topological properties to describe evolution of urban systems.
