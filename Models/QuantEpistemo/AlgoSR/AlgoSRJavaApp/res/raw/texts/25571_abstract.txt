The evaluation of proximity-accessibility is quite different among residents, and among trip purposes. Location choice, as reflected through the decision of buying a house, is partly influenced by perception of accessibility integrating the functionality and the coherence of an intra-urban system. However, theses perceptions can vary in space as well as in time. A better understanding of these perceptions can help improving public policies in urban planning and regional development to satisfy population needs. The paper presents a simple methodology to test and model the spatio-temporal evolution of perception of accessibility to various types of services in order to sustain public decisions in Quebec City.
