The proliferation of legal texts on question of water shows that it seems a major stake of the 21st century on the local, regional and  global level. That brings to wonder whether the local rules of managment of water (police de l’eau) answers stakes which exceed the local and national level to serve an international policy. The local texts that restrict uses of water make it possible to evaluate the effectivity of an management of water in reference to a framework enacted at the international level whose objective is to protect water resource at the planetary level. This then raises the question of the evolution of the function of the french local authority (préfet de département). Did this one become an authority charged to transmit the rule of the national level at the local level which, in the current planetary context, would be serve a global environmental order?
