Manila Bay is an intercity space shared between five of the seventeen cities which compose Metro-Manila. This bay, considered as the showcase of the capital city of the Philippines, has focused all the efforts in terms of urban management since Ferdinand Marcos came to power in 1965. Through the control of the population and the spaces, the setting of the Martial Law in 1972 still influences the urban governance, which is dominated by government institutions/offices and estate companies, although the civil society finds ways to express itself through official consultation procedures. Yet, the Manila Bay management project is now completed according to the Marcos era plan, in a democratic frame, with a low level of renewal among the urban governance offices and its elites.
