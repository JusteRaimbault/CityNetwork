For about two century, massive rural outmigrations have affected french hinterlands and increase towns population. Migratory balances have been the object of several studies, but migrants trajectories from the original zone aren’t none very well. To rebuild its, scarces patronimics wich comming out from hinterlands, are used as plotter permitting to follow a population through a wide period. Patronimic’s information has been found in phone books and results have been interpreted thanks to gravity model. If the bigest part of migrations is essentially headed for nearest big towns, gravity model residuals analysis have permitted to find spatial particular logical.
