Valley landscapes are a major stake in environmental management. Diagnoses are necessary in order to understand the valley landscapes at the regional scale. A morphometric approach showed the importance of the valleys (hillslopes, valley bottoms) in the structure of the regional landscape and the existence of “ordinary valleys” with banal forms. In this context, the aim of this paper is to propose a methodology to characterize their internal diversity and to assess their singularity beyond the context. Landscape metrics are calculated to quantify valley structure. There are extracted from land cover attributes obtained by remote sensing data (Spot Imagery). This quantitative approach is applied on a well-known valley by qualitative criteria.
