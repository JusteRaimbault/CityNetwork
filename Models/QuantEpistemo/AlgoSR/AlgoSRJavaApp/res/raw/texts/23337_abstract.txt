Following works achieved by the Globalization and World Cities (GAWC), the research consortium Polynet has set out to uncover how advanced producer services which are key in Sassenâ€™s global city theory, contribute to the making of Mega-City-Regions (MCR). This paper tests the validity and limits of MCR formation in the two cases of London/South-East England and Paris / Bassin parisien. Both quantitative data inspired by the GAWC interlocking city model and qualitative information gathered through semi-directive interviews are used. Results show the predominance of first cities (London and Paris agglomeration) but also the existence of specific trajectories between the two case studies. Notwithstanding their similar participation to the globalisation of advanced producer services, London and its region proves to be closer to the MCR formation model than its French counterpart which follows a distinct (multipolar moncentric) pattern.
