This research has evaluated the interface of society-space-resources dynamics in the Massif of the Fouta-Djalon from a perspective of sustainable environmental and territorial decision taking. It combines remote sensing and systemic modelization to analyse the dynamics of the territorial system. From the treatment of Landsat satellite images from 1975, 1985, and 2006, the retrospective land occupation of 31 years is characterized. It shows an expansion of the inhabited and agro pastoral territory against the forestry one. The universe of possible future of the socio-ecological system of the massif was analysed over 150 years through three scenarios. The scenarios are “constant value”, “fluctuation mini-max” and “continued annual growth” Those scenarios showed that the territorial system of the future is worrying from the ecological perspective and also from the social stability perspective. After the analyse of these scenarios, the best future perspective of the territorial system is presented in the “sustainable acceptable” scenario or durability model. An implementation scheme accompanies this model of integrated and sustainable administration of territory and environment.
