In the extreme southeast of France the Alpes-Maritimes are regularly touched by ozone pollution. Pollutant emissions due to human activities and to certain natural sources are responsible for it in weather conditions convenient to their bad dispersal. This photochemical said pollution is numerically feigned by determinist models with diverse spatial scales: they take into account atmosphere chemistry and transport of pollutants. Excessively complex these tools allow to inform the citizens the day before or two days before about the air quality whom they are going to inhale. These models thus perform a preventive mission because certain decisions will be taken in case of peaks pollution forecast. This article aims to estimate the reliability of the AIRES platform, a local application of the PREVâ€™AIR model which models the atmospheric pollution on a European scale. This validation is established by the confrontation of the model outputs with the data measured on the ground during very numerous itinerant ozone measurements campaigns.
