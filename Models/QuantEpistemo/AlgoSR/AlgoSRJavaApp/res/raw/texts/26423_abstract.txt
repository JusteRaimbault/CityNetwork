How far do built up areas integrate vegetation? According to income levels, do households live in more or less vegetalised districts? This paper reports a research based upon data on land use, urban fabric and sociodemographic features in the city of Paris. A data base was built, using a GIS. Three sets of paradoxical relationships were found. The first â€“ haussmannian- paradox relies to the concentration of well off households in the least vegetalised districts. In the second paradox, gentrifiers were hypothezised to live in the most vegetalised districts: data analysis does not confirm this hypothesis. The third major findings are also counter-intuitive: retired households are living in the most vegetalized areas in Paris, wherever rich or poor. These results open up new lines of interpretation and of further research on gentrification processes, and of urban change more generally.
