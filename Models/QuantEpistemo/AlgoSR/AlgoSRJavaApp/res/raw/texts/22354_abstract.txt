When it was adopted in 1999, the European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP) was considered as a guiding document for actions and policies dealing with spatial planning from European to local levels. As a non-binding document, it was supposed to “shape minds” of actors implementing spatial planning actions and policies. However, according to a report published in 2007 by a consortium of European researchers within the framework of the European Spatial Planning Observatory Network, the ESDP remained widely ignored. According to the report, this situation could be explained by a weak dissemination of the ESDP objectives at European and infra-European levels. This article argues that the weak impact of the ESDP is less related to the unsatisfactory process of information dissemination than to the technocratic making of the ESDP. It argues that what is at stake when dealing with ESDP type document is the involvement of the actors in charge to implement policies, notably at infra-national scales. Taking into consideration this situation, the author makes propositions to insure a better application of European objectives in terms of spatial planning.
