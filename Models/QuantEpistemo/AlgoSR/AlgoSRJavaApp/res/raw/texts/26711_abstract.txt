Urban mobility represents a set of complex behaviors, which are difficult to measure. Independently of individual choices and motivations, these behaviors may be influenced by urban environmental characteristics. The level of physical activity is well recognized as a major determinant in the development of several chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, the obesity and some cancers. Increasing the PA level in the population through the promotion of active mobility is considered as a public health priority in France. However, there is a lack of data for analyzing active mobility (walking and cycling) as a health behavior. One of the main research challenges in this field is to better measure active mobility (in a real life context) and, at the same time, to better locate and identify places where the activity is performed. In this pilot study, we describe a method for collecting and processing data on active mobility combining motion sensors capacities (GPS and accelerometer) and implementing collected data in a Geographic Information System. Despite some limitations, the use of multi-sensor may hold potentials for collecting objective data on active mobility at a large scale.
