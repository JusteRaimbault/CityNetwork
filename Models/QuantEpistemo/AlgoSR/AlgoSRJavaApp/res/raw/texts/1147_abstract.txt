On the fourth of July 1996, the Walt Disney Companydedicated its last creation, the city of Celebration, its first true attempt at planning a whole city built to house 20.000 people. Celebration was designed according to the standards of the neotraditional town-planning movement and thus reproduces the Main Street section of the theme parks. Its attempt to function as a refuge-city is suggested through references to an idealized past. This article aims to show the influences used during the design stage and the promotion of the city, aswell as the reactions it sparked in the American pressÂ : Celebration was infact presented to the public as a prime alternative to decaying fifties suburbs of the Sun Belt, a utopia for the nineteen-nineties.
