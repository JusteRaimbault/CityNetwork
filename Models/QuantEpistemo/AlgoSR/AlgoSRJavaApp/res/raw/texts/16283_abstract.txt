Fractal dimension is used to measure the spatial arrangement (morphology) of built-up areas within a Nuts1 region (Wallonia, Belgium) and, more particularly, to test to what extent fractal dimension is related to some variables commonly used in urban economics/urban geography to characterise built environment, housings and residential choice (such as land price, housing rentals, history of urbanisation, type of housing). Special attention is put on the link with the perception of the built environment by households. A multivariate analysis concludes the paper. It is shown that fractal indices differ from other indicators and are very useful for characterising and understanding built landscapes, as well as for modelling and planning urban realities.
