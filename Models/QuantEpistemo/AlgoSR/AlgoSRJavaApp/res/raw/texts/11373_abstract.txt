This paper aims to develop innovative and efficient demand responsive transport in rural and low densities areas (Pays du Doubs Central, Franche-Comt√©, France). After having depicted the state of art of the main optimization methods for transport, we define precisely the parameters assigned to the TAD in the Doubs Central. We set the mathematical formalism to describe the problem. We then propose and evaluate a specific optimization problem able to find quickly rather good paths, according to the territorial and functional constraints. We conclude on discussing the results and opening on further improving works
