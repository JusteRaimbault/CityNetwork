This paper aims at reconsidering the position of decision taking in elaborating activity space. It suggests an alternate approach resting on two distinct yet interconnected aspects, cognitive routines and daily occurrences addressed by people, which occur outside and require movements. This approach leads to a new activity space heuristic in which cognitive routines and their adaptation by occurrences set the background of the peopleâ€™s daily behaviour.
