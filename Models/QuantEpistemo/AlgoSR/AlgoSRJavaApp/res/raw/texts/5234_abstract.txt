<r2r:ml lang="ru"><p class="resumeru" dir="ltr">The rural dynamics of the Ecuadorian Sierra are the result of the three-fold influence of demographic pressure, modes of land occupation and migration. The Bolívar province, situated on the outer slopes of the western Cordillera is of particular importance as it is a key territory in regional migration. Demographic growth, which is in fact fairly high, gives rise to a fairly low rate of population increase locally but a very high level of emigration towards the lowlands of the pediment, towards the country's major cities, Quito and Guayaquil, and also into Amazonia. When we add to this the two models of spatial organisation among the <em>mestizos</em> and the <em>campesinos</em>, we can clearly see the source of the conflict that is shaking the Sierra, namely, who should cultivate and who should control. <br />The study is based on three levels of analysis. First we look at the relationship between the Bolívar province and the rest of the country. Secondly, we analyse at regional level and using different chorotypes. Lastly, we focus on a small valley, examining the unequal distribution of land and the diversity of resources which give rise to three distinct socio-spatial systems : <em>hacienda</em>, <em>mestizos</em> and <em>campesinos</em> which are represented in a hillside model. </p></r2r:ml>
