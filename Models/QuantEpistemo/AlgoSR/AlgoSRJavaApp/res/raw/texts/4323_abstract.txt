Whereas several texts and articles have been published about the concept of a Québec nation, few of them tackle with the idea that the nation is also a geopolitical image and implies a territory. This parallels the extreme poverty of cartographic representation of Québec.

It illustrates the geopolitical dimension of map-making, as the establishes a direct link between the graphic image of a territory and the debate surrounding the definition of the national territory.
