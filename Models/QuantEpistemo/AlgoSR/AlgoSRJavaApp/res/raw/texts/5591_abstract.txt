This work is an analysis of the representations of street commerce (ambulantaje) in Mexico City through its representations in the 18th Century Pintura de Castas, in photography from the late 19th Century through the beginning of the 20th Century, and in press photos from the turn of the 21st Century. This essay looks at the transformations that ambulantaje has had in the different eras of the development of Mexico City through the analysis of the producers of the images and the imaginarium of this type of commerce, through the use of the Pintura de Castas or of photographs. The three articles that make up the essay look at how ambulantaje has been represented in each era, what features of this activity have been modified and which ones have been maintained from one period to another, and how the analysis of the representations of one time period helps to understand the images propagated in the following periods. The authors examine three dimensions of the representation of ambulantaje for each period: social, territorial and economic dimensions. In spite of the different sources and analytic perspectives of each author, we can identify aspects that remain constant throughout this long time period and allow us to understand the dynamics of the social phenomenon of this type of commerce in Mexico City, within an historical, as well as traditional, framework. We conclude that ambulantaje is an activity which adapts to the changing conditions of public space, and this adaptability makes it possible to continue throughout the different eras of urban development.
