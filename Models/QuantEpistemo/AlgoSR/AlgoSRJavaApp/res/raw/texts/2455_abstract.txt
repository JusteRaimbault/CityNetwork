The last South African census of 2001 is a data source extremely varied and accurate on the state of the population. More rigorous than the last one, it reveals the will of the statistical services to provide information at different spatial scales and to produce more or less aggregated data (persons or households). Some topics were the subject of a thorough reflexion (definition of the concept of “urban” for example) but others still need to be improved (approach of the informal economic sector). However, it provides new data, such as the transportation means used by the commuters. It opens a new era in the history of demographic statistics, accessible to all, and it allows for comparative studies.
