The railway station of Canfranc, located on the line of the western transpyrénéen (opened in 1928) did not know the traffic waited during its building. Symbol of whole country liking to show its dynamism and its modernity by opening with Europe, this vast international station made the object of a considerable architectural and urbanistic plan not to say immoderate with regard to actual railroad traffic (abolished quoted France since 1970). Having lost in a landscape of high mountain, the second biggest railway station of Europe represents a special heritage for numerous reasons, particularly because the rail landscape which comes to the visitor is absolutely unique. The Spanish actors concentrate on created it of emblematic building of the passengers today. The rest of hold is earned a little more every day by the abandonment and the waste land and urgent front to be transformed into urban space (according to the plan of discreet architect). This choice of a break-up programmed by rail hold, and by to a great extent not rail réaffectation, answers certainly the wish to promote this place but destroys what could constitute the vastest conservatory of the history of the western railway.
