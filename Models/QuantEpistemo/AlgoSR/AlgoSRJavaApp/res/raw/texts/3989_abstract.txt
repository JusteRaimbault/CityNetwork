After 40 years of relative political stability, India has experienced in the 1990’s six changes of government and the rise of Hindu nationalism. The ascension to power of a coalition led by the BJP (Bharatya Janata Party) is the result of this party’s policy to nominate for the first time candidates from intermediate castes in certain states and from regional parties in others that were traditional allies of the Congress Party, long run by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. The major challenges facing this government are improving governance, with the establishment of clear relationships between the Centre and the States, and keeping a safe distance from aggressive forms of hindutva.
