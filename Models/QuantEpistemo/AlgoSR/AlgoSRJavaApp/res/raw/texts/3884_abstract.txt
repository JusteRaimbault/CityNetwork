The goal of this work is to study urban dynamics on the Senegalese littoral by satellite image processing. Built-up areas have markedly increased during the last decades, especially on the Petite CÃ´te region, which is becoming the first region of the country regarding tourism and leisure activities. SPOT images from 1988 and 2000 are processed here in order to characterise the distribution pattern and the spatial dynamics of built-up areas. A method for the extraction of built-up areas through a semi-automatic way, by means of spectral and spatial satellite image processing is presented. Quantification of built-up dynamics is finally provided by granulometric analysis on the pre-processed satellite images.
