Begun with a series of statement reports in the sixties, studies of urban sprawl today focus more on an understanding of the phenomenon and explanations of it (in particular, in its relation to transport).  Much of the research analyzes urban sprawl from the angle of road speeds.  Because they often use very general combined international scales based on sketchy statistics, these studies do not manage to treat the question on a smaller scale—for example, on issues related to communal land—primarily because of lack of data on speed. The object of this article is to provide a methodology that will make it possible to obtain data speeds that are suitable for use in more general studies on urban sprawl.  The piece offers a series of procedures aiming at gradually integrating a wide variety of parameters:  the curve of the roads, statistics on the number of roadways, the percentage of heavy lorries, the volume of traffic and, finally, the number of traffic lights.  The latter are integrated in a hybrid model associating logistic graphs, a macroscopic traffic model (Greenshields) and a stochastic (random variation) model for calculating waiting times at traffic lights.
