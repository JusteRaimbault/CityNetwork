The “local democracy” law adopted in France in February 2002 has institutionalized urban neighborhoods as new political spaces for participative democracy. The law strongly recommends the creation of those political subdivisions and imposes it to communes over 80.000. As a result, the neighborhood becomes a political territory to be produced. I therefore sought, in the heterogeneous and complex urban context of the Paris area, the municipalities pushing for the creation of neighborhoods through participative democracy and the factors underlying their choice in 2007 and in 2011.
