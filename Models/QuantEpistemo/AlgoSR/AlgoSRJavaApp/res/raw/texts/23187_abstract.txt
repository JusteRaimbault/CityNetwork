“Trame verte” (greenway) has become one “star” of the Grenelle laws. However, the concept is not new as evidenced by the multiplicity of legal instruments (sometimes old) that may regulate and plan the components of a greenway (I). However, the local example studied, the Angers Loire Métropole urban region, demonstrates how difficult it is to connect the diversity of national and international tools to ground truth at the communal planning level (II). This shift from global to local can draw some lessons for a better consideration of greenways, but it also raises some questions that the future regional ecological corridors Grenelle plan will probably have to cope with (III).
