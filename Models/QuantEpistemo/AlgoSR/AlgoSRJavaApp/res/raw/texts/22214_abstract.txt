The first provincial geographical society in France was established at Lyon in 1873 and diffused geographical knowledge by means of lectures and publications for many years. Accounts of missionary activity, exploration, colonization and foreign trade satisfied popular fascination for the exotic, and also generated potentially useful information for the city’s merchants and industrialists at the time when the French empire reached its peak. African adventures appealed to large audiences, whilst the Far East was of special interest to silk merchants and investors, and other members of the Society were keen to learn about European destinations for future holidays. Academic geographers participated in the Society but had little impact before the 1920s. Earlier attempts to realign activities with the "new geography" professed by Vidal de la Blache were not immediately successful. The Society’s lectures continued to attract audiences until the late 1960s but the Bulletin ceased to exist in 1937 and was overtaken by publications from the city’s university, notably Les Études rhodaniennes later known as the Revue de géographie de Lyon, and subsequently Géocarrefour. Geography was no longer a topic of widespread popular interest having become a more emphatically academic concern.
