Within the transport research, modelling and simulation enable to analyse and evaluate the functioning of a mobility system which depends on the context. It is a necessary stage in order to develop and improve innovative transport service such as Demand Responsive Transport (DRT). Among various modelling approaches, Agent Based Models (ABM) are frequently used by geographers. ABMs allow to follow statistically and precisely the system advancement and we can observe intuitively spatio-temporal development of forms. This paper presents an example of theoretical flexible transport simulated with Netlogo ABM tool. Using the ODD (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol we explain the model operation, and results obtained relating to flows structuring and service optimization. Multi-agent paradigm's issues in transport research are discussed and we present some methodological and thematic perspectives.
