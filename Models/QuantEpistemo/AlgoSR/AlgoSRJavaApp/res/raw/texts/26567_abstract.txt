Portugal has launched an ambitious energy transition strategy, such as other European countries. To reach this goal, it committed to triple its production capacities of renewable in comparison with the situation in 2005, by 2020. Incentive policies helped to strongly increase the capacities of wind power. Nevertheless this considerable development of wind energy is limited by the unpredictable intermittency of production which requires a large increase in hydropower potential including the implementation of several reservoirs and pumped-storage plants. Portugal has launched since 2007 what is described as “the most important hydroelectricity project in Europe over the last 25 years”. However the construction of eight new dams provokes protests in the name of environment, heritage and landscapes protection. Indeed a new dam is built in the Upper Douro valley, a UNESCO World Heritage site, which has been listed for the value of its iconic vineyards landscapes. The various local conflicts in the Portuguese valleys and the protection of the traditional landscapes show the complexity of implementation of renewables, even when the aims of the planners seem to be compatible with concerns of environmentalist protesters, such as an ambitious policy of energy transition. Thus the Portuguese case shows the complexity to set up energy transition.
