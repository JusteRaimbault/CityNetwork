This contribution provides an animated mapping for representing  the concepts of spatial diffusion as applied to  a demographic variable : rare patronymics. The patronymics are used as marker of migration. Initially, the elementary rules of the diffusion are expressed on a map in a theoretical way as  regular and hierarchic networking processes. Then they are projected on the French space of départements taken in its distances, its limits and its hierarchies. Combination of the elementary rules, constrained by the spatial and temporal expression of the migration of the patronymics, leads to a model that is then compared with the observation. The cartographic representation of one scenario of combinations  allows the visualization of the assumptions and the experimentation on the space. In this context the animated map allows the transition from illustration to experimentation.
