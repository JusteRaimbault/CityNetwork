Two experiments were performed in the French Alps to study the reflectance of snow in the solar spectrum. This information is usefull for climatological studies and avalanche forescasting. The Landsat TM data are compared to the results of a theorical bi-directionnal snow reflectance model, and of a physically-based numerical model of snow metamorphism.
