Unlike other contemporary productions, mono-scalar, but ethnocentric (Levasseur), or cosmopolitan (Reclus), or multi-scalar with interlocking levels of scales (Geddes), Vidal de la Blanche’s Atlas has a structure that is complex, multi-scalar and polymorphous, because it makes use of ‘referential spaces’ that differ from one plate to another. This structure was possible because of an iconographic and textual assemblage based on a composite unity, the Atlas plate forming a composition that has become canonical: maps, insets, caption. The study of the whole of the iconographic system and the textual apparatus reveals that the work is multi-scalar in two ways: first of all because, in conformity with the Vidalian epistemology, each region of the world possesses its own referential spaces, which give it its specific dimension, and on the other hand, because the Earth is in principle the ultimate unit of reference, the all-inclusive meta-scale. This meta-scale in fact includes three separate ‘worlds’, economic, imperial and civilisational, forming three intermediate meta-scales. Beyond the concern for universality, the metropolises of one or the other of these worlds (France and Europe) remain central in this representational system.
