The current urban world is basically different from the rural world. Indeed the quite systematic enforcement of the Chart of Athens has increased a lot the number of districts without any soul. The young living in those districts are thus facing great difficulties for building their own identity in so far as this environment does not give any framework. As a result, they get difficulties to find out a balanced way of live enabling them to get success at school. Hence, the "Education nationale" in France has to develop a cultural policy which can cope with those difficulties. After processing the legitimity and the goals of the cultural action of the "education nationale" in France, we will show its shapes and means. Eventually, it will be interesting to try to evaluate this policy.
