Every day, each of us uses his own cognitive representations of space. Cognitive localisations are an aspect of this knowledge. The averages over chained lists of points (ACLP) method is presented in this paper as a solution to summarize several of these individual cognitive localisations into a single geographic coordinate system. The proposed method allows to collect and process information using places, understood as the basic component of individual cognitive representations of space. ACLP method is adapted to the context of work with geographic information systems (GIS) and applied to welfare.
