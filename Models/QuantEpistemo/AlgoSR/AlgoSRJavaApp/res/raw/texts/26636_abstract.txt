This text presents a long version of August 4th 2013 meetings conference in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, against the international airport project for the metropolis of Nantes. Metropolization is presented to the public as the future of humanity. Here we demonstrate that it is primarily the result of the long-term Crisis, started in the seventies and in which capitalism survives by indulging in his penchant for rent, predatory economy, and spatial adjustment usually called Globalization. Metropoles are the spatial pressure points of that « new economy ». Metropolization, in which, as all geographic studies show, the imbalances and inequalities increase, is the urban pretense of a reality of spatial inversion, and de-urbanization in centrifugal flow created by the crisis.
