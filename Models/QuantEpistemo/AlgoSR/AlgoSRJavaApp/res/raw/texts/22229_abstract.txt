The links between heritage and vulnerabilities are complex. We start by showing that vulnerability can involve strategies of heritage development and conversely. Our observations will then deal with the multidimensional factors of vulnerability. Great poverty is still a reality in African cities; town dwellers will hence favour survival strategy. At a time where heritage is used as a tool for economical growth, its issue becomes a stake of great importance and occasionally a source of conflicts. The resilience seems to have a moderating influence to vulnerabilities. Examples are taken in world's heritage African cities with case studies in Mali and Ethiopia.
