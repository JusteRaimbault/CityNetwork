The result of received radar signal is granularity in the image - the so-called "speckle" effect - which makes it impossible to use a classical image processing algorithms. We have sought to define texture characteristics. Some filtering methods can modify the spatial distribution of pixels and can create of a great deal of textural information to help classification of different classes.
