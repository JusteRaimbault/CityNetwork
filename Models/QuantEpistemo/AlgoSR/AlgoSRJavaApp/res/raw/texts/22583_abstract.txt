The term éco-quartier is today largely used by urban planners or stakeholders. It is often considered as synonym for quartier durable. Both terms would designate the urban projects with ambitious environmental, societal, and economic objectives, multiplied in France since the last few years. However, in practice, people do not all agree with this point of view. Are these sustainable urban projects quartiers durables or éco-quartier or both? This article aims at highlighting this question of vocabulary, even if an academic definition of this urban object has not been found. The pertinence of using the expression éco-quartier or quartier durable to designate new urban districts created in recent human and environmental sustainable context will be analysed. From that moment on, we will consider the different uses of these expressions taking into account the material, theoretical and temporal context where these new urban elements are inserted. Finally, we will show that utilisation of one term or the other goes beyond vocabulary and reveal a part of French urban planning trend.
