This research examines the ability of a decision theory to consider the individuals real place of residence. Its goal is two-fold: firstly, to propose a method for testing empirically the Subjective Expected Utility Theory applied on the residential choice, and secondly, to highlight the differences in the evaluation of the city's districts related to the existence of population's groups defined by their family and social status. Using a survey, the validity of this decision theory can be partly confirmed, but its implementation underlines a set of difficulties related in particular to the information acquisition.
