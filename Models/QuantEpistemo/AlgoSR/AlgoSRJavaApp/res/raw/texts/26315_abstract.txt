Local personnel numbers focus attention when there are strong constraints on public budgets. Using financial data for local governments in Ile-de-France, the weight and the share of public expenditure in personnel spending are evaluated. Communitiesâ€™ expenditures for their employees exceed the amount of local taxes. The share of expenditure in the operating budgets reached on average 36% in 2000, 41% in 2010. As a consequence, the financial rigidity increases. Local contrasts in personnel costs are strong. For instance charges increase with population and stabilize for the most important localities. Given the diversity, restrictive measures should take different paths according to local contexts. The expenditures of the various levels of government are added together. The share of departments is closed to the share of communities. Reductions in personnel spending need joint actions of these two levels. But political rivalries and questions about governance suggest that outcomes are rather uncertain.
