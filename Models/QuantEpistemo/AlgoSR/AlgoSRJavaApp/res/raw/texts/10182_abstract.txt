Social and economic changes in urban spaces are the subject of much debate in the area of urban research. This article aims to focus on the spatial aspects of these changes. Using the examples of the eight largest French cities, it shows major changes in the structure of residential segregation between 1968 and 1999. The social space at the beginning of the 21st century is characterised by a new complexity of the urban space, which can no longer be summarised by the three classic dimensions of “social status”, “demographic status”, and “ethnic status” that are traditionally mobilised to describe urban areas. In addition, the study evidences the different processes of redistribution of the population across the urban space, articulating in different manner according to social, demographic and ethnic characteristics of the urban population.
