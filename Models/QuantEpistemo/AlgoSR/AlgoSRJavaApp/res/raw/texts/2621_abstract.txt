Cartography is a discipline which evolves simultaneously with the sciences it uses. Initially, the contributions of the geometry enabled cartographers to represent physical geographical Then, the contributions of the statistics made it possible to represent abstracted phenomena and thems on topographical maps, by structuring information before communicating it graphically and efficiently. Today, the contributions offered by the new data-processing possibilities offer new possibilities. They mainly rely on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and on the experience of Eploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main characteristics of this multimedia and interactive cartography can be structured in a synthetic figure. Cartographic evolutions are presented as “added values”, calling upon different senses, with different levels of interactivity. These new possibilities contribute to modify cartography and particullarly its role of communication, as well as the relationship between the actors that emit and the actors that receive the cartographical information.
