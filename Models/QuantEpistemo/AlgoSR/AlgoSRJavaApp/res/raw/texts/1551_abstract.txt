This interdiciplinary research focuses on explaining the process of bush progression in Causse MÃ©jan. The paper presents the method by which heterogeneous data in time and space scales have been matched and hierarchized. Data upon vegetation, environment conditions, history of property and land use, social practices and representations have been treated by P.C.A. (to describe vegetation) and by Canonical Analysis (to check its correlations with explanatory factors). This research opens some ways for modeling the interactions between biophysical and social systems.
