Uncontrolled urbanization and the growing population pressure are essential challenges for the water management in urbanized regions of the emerging- and developing nations. In the context of a recently made research study the influence of uncontrolled urbanization regarding the groundwater recourses of the megacity Yogyakarta was explicitly analyzed. The study shows, that the groundwater replenishment has not diminished despite of the growing soil sealing which comes as a consequence of the growing urbanization. On the contrary the urban groundwater replenishment has even slightly accumulated. Admittedly the groundwater pollution rises very clearly. This is due to the effects of urban groundwater replenishment such as sewer leakages and badly constructed or actually missing sewage systems. These effects were also measured in Yogyakarta. Many inhabitants of Yogyakarta are not linked to the sewage system and conduct their sewerage through sumps and latrines directly into the subsoil. Thence the water infiltrates those aquifer located close to the surface in a little while and that often leads to a heavy contamination of the groundwater. Only 30% of the population living in the agglomeration of Yogyakarta are connected with the public water support system. Therefore many households have to cover their water demand with the help of dug wells directly from the groundwater.
