Maps could have a lot of surimposed informations, as risk maps. Thus, data are difficult to portray. We believe a best use of colour could improve their legibility. Therefore, we proposea model to automatically improve colour contrasts in these maps. Our model is based on Itten colour contrasts theory, a Swiss painter of the Bauhaus of the twentieth century.
