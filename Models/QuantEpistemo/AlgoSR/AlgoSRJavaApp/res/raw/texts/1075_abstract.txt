The accelerated mutation of Moscow since 1991 provocated a transformation in the urban policy which is characterized by : a concentration always stronger of the decision´s power, the radicalism of the urbanistic practices, the conformism and the imitation of outside models. Two contradictory purposes are co-existing. The will to transform Moscow into an international pole (ambitious aspect of this policy) and the wish to "re-russificate" the image of the capital (nostalgic aspect). The power seeks for its roots and pays a lot of attention to the projects of renovation. The influence of the multiple actors involved in Moscow is expressed by an inceasing presence of multicultral aspects in the space of the city.
