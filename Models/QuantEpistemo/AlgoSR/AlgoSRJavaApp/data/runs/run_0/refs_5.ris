AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - A distribution network reconfiguration scheme based on co-evolution algorithm is proposed, which breaks down the distribution network reconfiguration into the optimization of sub-loops and applies the concept of separate evolution under periodic coordination to realize the optimization. The populations same in quantity as the sub-loops are generated and independently evolved with the globally optimal solution as its optimization direction. A specific genetic operation is used to reduce the infeasible solutions for enhancing the optimization efficiency and the "certain tree" is adopted to restore the infeasible solution for avoiding the locally optimal solution. Case study proves its better effect and efficiency.

AB  - Planners often use land price models as tools to support coordinated\nland use-transportation planning, and as instruments to measure the\nbenefits of land use and transportation improvements, particularly when\nconsidering a value capture approach to alternative taxation\npossibilities. In this paper, we present a land price model\ncharacterized by the use of spatial data in a spatial context, by the\nuse of a spatial association parameter and a formal definition of\nneighborhood that we interpret as elements of an economic externality.\nOur model analyzes the effects of some usual land use and accessibility\nvariables, and the magnitude of external economies affecting prices\nusing a spatially switching autoregressive model. Using as a case study\nthe city of Sendai in northeastern Japan (pop. about 1 million), we find\nconsiderable presence of spatial external economies, and heterogeneous\neffects of the price determinants between the CBD and the rest of the\ncity.

AB  - Future land-use configurations provide valuable knowledge for policy makers and economic agents, especially under expected environmental changes such as decreasing rainfall or increasing temperatures. This chapter proposes an optimisation approach for modelling land-use change in which landscapes (land uses) are generated through the use of an evolutionary algorithm called GeneticLand. It is designed for a multiobjective function that aims at the minimisation of soil erosion and the maximisation of carbon sequestration, under a set of local restrictions. GeneticLand has been applied to a Mediterranean landscape, located in southern Portugal. The algorithm design and the results obtained show the feasibility of the generated landscapes, the appropriateness of the evolutionary methods to model land-use changes and the spatial characteristics of the landscape solutions that emerge when physical drivers have a major influence on their evolution.

AB  - The common confusion of land cover and land use in many data sets is problematic for many data integration activities. This article proposes an approach for the separation of land cover and land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case, they provide building blocks that allow land cover and land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land cover) and function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land cover and locations where the concepts of use and cover are confused. The separation of land cover and land use facilitates the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

AB  - An explosion of multi-lane roundabout projects has recently occurred in Central Ohio. This paper discusses four transportation improvement studies for which multiple multi-lane roundabouts were chosen as the preferred solution. The projects include: 1) a high volume partial cloverleaf interchange design that will include high-capacity roundabouts at the ramp terminal intersections and other intersections within the corridor; 2) a six-mile extension of a suburban/rural four-lane principal arterial that will include six roundabouts along it's length; 3) two closely spaced, high capacity, roundabouts in a densely developed area, near two schools, 4) roundabouts utilized for access improvements in a future office/commercial growth corridor. This paper includes a description of these projects and a discussion of how the choice of multi-lane roundabouts in Transportation planning decisions at these locations will reduce delay and vehicle emissions and air pollution while also improving safety, aesthetics, and access management. The analysis presented in this paper is highly abbreviated. Please contact the author for additional information or greater detail of the analysis.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land tenure and resource availability can play a critical role in the land use decision-making process, resulting in different types of land use changes. This paper investigates the role of land tenure security and farm household characteristics on land use change in the Prasae Watershed, Thailand, using GIS and farm-level data. Forest conversion to annual crops and subsequently to perennial crops was a typical land use change during 1982-2004. Tenure insecurity is found to be associated with deforestation and forest encroachment. Insecure landholders adopt perennial crops in order to acquire basic land use rights and entitlement to subsequent legal registration, while more secure land tenure is seen to have economic advantages for production and long-term investment. Although land tenure security can act as a crucial factor in land use decision making, farmers opt for different land use options based on characteristics such as farm size and available labor. To advance the economic well-being of insecure and temporary landholders and support forest conservation, this report concludes that an effective policy should aim to improve both farm productivity and land quality while protecting the remaining forest. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

Substantial agricultural expansion over the past 50 years has opened and fragmented much of the forest surrounding the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, posing a series of threats to the coupled human-environment systems. These threats are traced in a conceptual model borrowed from vulnerability studies and detailed in regard to ecosystem responses, including forest structure and composition, above-ground biomass, soil nutrients, balance in species and biotic diversity, and invasive species. The land-use and land-cover changes underway pose trade-offs in ecosystem services and raise several scalar issues important to deforestation studies.

AB  - Cooperative work now routinely spans organizational, geographical and other boundaries. Objects and tasks also increasingly have ready access to one another (increasing reach). These trends pose important problems for analyzing and supporting coordination among tasks. Thinking about coordination has focused on articulation, i.e., making sure that everything needed to accomplish a task is available and functioning. Coordination mechanisms (brackets) are forms and procedures used to reduce the complexity of articulation work; that is, rationalize it by making parts work together smoothly. But increasing reach requires a distinction between metawork (the work of organizing work) and local articulation (the work of making sure that everything needed in the immediate situation is in place).  This in turn leads to an additional problem in analyzing coordination. Coordination trades off against standardization and segregation of tasks, because these latter processes reduce opportunities to make use of specialized local circumstances. Hence they make local articulation more problematical. At the same time, they make metawork simpler by making it possible to recombine and superimpose tasks in many ways with abstract protocols such as TCP/IP, XML and the services that rest upon it. In this sense, segregation and standardization potentiate many new ways of coordinating tasks, even as they undercut the old ones. For example, ready availability of airline flight information via the Internet facilitates the work of hotels, car rentals, limousines, and other services that coordinate with airline operations.  Local articulation tasks present a different set of coordination problems. Customization in some form is needed to tie abstract protocols to local circumstances. In addition, the lack of authoritative control across organiza2 tional, geographical, and jurisdictional boundaries means that a variety of reconciliation mechanisms are needed to ensure efficiency, efficacy and equity. I discuss three such mechanisms: cross-cutting ties among personal networks, participant review (e.g., elections and peer review), and patronage. The paper concludes by suggesting that CSCW efforts should focus on methods and tools for making customization and reconciliation easier.

AB  - Disease emergence events have been documented following several types of land use change. This chapter reviews several health-relevant land use changes recognized today, including: 1) urbanization and urban sprawl; 2) water projects and agricultural development; 3) road construction and deforestation in the tropics; and 4) regeneration of temperate forests. Because habitat or climatic change substantially affects intermediate invertebrate hosts involved in many prevalent diseases, this chapter provides a basic description of vector-borne disease biology as a foundation for analyzing the effects of land use change. Urban sprawl poses health challenges stemming from heat waves exacerbated by the "urban heat island" effect, as well as from water contamination due to expanses of impervious road and concrete surfaces. Dams, irrigation and agricultural development have long been associated with diseases such as schistosomiasis and filariasis. Better management methods are required to address the trade-offs between expanded food production and altered habitats promoting deadly diseases. Deforestation can increase the nature and number of breeding sites for vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and onchocerciasis. Human host and disease vector interaction further increases risk, as can a change in arthropod-vector species composition.

AB  - In this summary chapter, we highlight three over-arching patterns among the ecosystem responses presented by the chapters in this volume. The first pattern is one of altered abundances and fluxes of water, nutrients, energy and species in ecosystems-always taking place initially after land use change, and often evolving and persisting over some extended period of time. A second repeating pattern is that there are clear bioclimatic and edaphic controls over the vulnerability of ecosystems to degradation during land use. A third emergent pattern is that indirect, unintended responses are ubiquitous across all types of land use and represent additional trade-offs in ecosystem services that go well beyond the direct impacts of land use change. Combined, these three patterns provide a conceptual basis upon which to develop a framework for systematic assessment of ecosystem responses to land use and land use change.

AB  - Integrated land use transportation models have been evolved as the primary metropolitan planning vehicle in the last several decades as the world development and urbanization continues. Urban regions continue planning for development of their urbanized areas using these modeling processes. Land use/demographic forecasting models provide the main input for the travel demand models, yet until recently the rigorous application of such models in the integrated land use transportation process was scanty except for the largest metropolitan areas. Such models require consideration of environmental factors and modeling of metropolitan economic systems. Theoretical and technological advancement of the last few decades has instigated a new wave of attention, research and further developments of the models and techniques from a variety of disciplines. This article briefly discusses the advancements and provides a guideline for their future improvements. It also discusses importance of role of national government and legislative mandates in ascertaining quality of planning process by reviewing some excerpts from U.S. legislation.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly.\n\nLonger term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production – offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping – along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production.

AB  - The last two decades have witnessed the implementation of various policies based on land-use to address problems stemming from automobile ownership and use. There are, however, questions with respect to the ecacy of such policies. This paper therefore reviews the literature on empirical studies of the transportation ±land-use interaction with the objective of identifying the current state of knowledge concerning the interactions, particularly with respect to the impact land-use policies are likely to have on the system. The focus is on studies conducted in North America. The results are mixed; some studies conclude that urban densities, traditional neighborhood design schemes, and land-use mix have an impact on auto ownership and use. Other studies ®nd the impact of such variables to be at best marginal. Gaps in our understanding of the interaction are identi®ed. These are found to be primarily the result of data limitations and methodological weaknesses. A detailed discussion of the implications of the ®ndings for the development and application of integrated transportation±land-use models is provided, with the recommendation that without such an integrated approach to analyzing the transportation±land-use interaction, any study of impacts of urban form on travel behavior is likely to yield erroneous results.

AB  - This report on Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF) is the response to the invitation by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to develop good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). GPG-LULUCF provides supplementary methods and good practice guidance for estimating, measuring, monitoring and reporting on carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, and Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. The GPG-LULUCF assists countries in producing inventories for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector that are neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and in which uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. It supports the development of inventories that are transparent, documented, consistent over time, complete, comparable, assessed for uncertainties, subject to quality control and quality assurance, and efficient in the use of resources. The GPG-LULUCF is consistent with the existing good practice guidance for the other sector and addresses: • \t Choice of estimation method within the context of the IPCC Guidelines; • \t Quality assurance and quality control procedures to provide cross-checks during the inventory compilation; • \t Data and information to be documented, archived and reported to facilitate review and assessment of inventory estimates; • \t Quantification of uncertainties at the source or sink category level and for the inventory as a whole, so that resources available can be directed toward reducing uncertainties over time, and the improvement can be tracked.

AB  - Online (all Chapters)  http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-3-540-77380-1  Once rare, wildfires are becoming increasingly common in the Amazon. For the last several decades, Brazil has worked to settle the Amazon. People have cleared many areas and fragmented much of the remaining forest.  Most regional land uses are fire-derived, fire-managed, or make the remaining forests more vulnerable to fire.   Closed-canopy forests generally remain relatively cool and moist even during the dry season when weeks may pass without rain. However, extreme drought events eventually dry the surface fuels enough to make the forest susceptible to fire. Continual ignition events along forest edges make forest fires inevitable during these periods. Once damaged by either fire or selective logging, the forest canopy becomes fractured, allowing moisture to be rapidly pumped from the forest by small-scale convection cells. These damaged forests dry rapidly and become fire-susceptible nearly every year during the dry season.   Poorly adapted to fire, the forests suffer severe damage and high mortality even during low-intensity fires. Each fire results in an increase in fuel loads from dying and decaying trees. Subsequent fires burn more intensely, spread faster, and can kill even the largest, thickest barked trees.   Therefore, human land use and the ecological traits of the forest combine to make them susceptible to a positive feedback process whereby fires become more frequent and more severe until the forest collapses and is replaced by grass or scrub vegetation.   Ongoing climate change is warming the Amazon and may potentially reduce rainfall or increase drought frequency or intensity. These forests have persisted through many periods of previous climate change.   However, the current conditions of ubiquitous ignitions, extensive clearing, fragmentation, and damage to the forests may combine to make large regions vulnerable to fire conversion of these lush biodiverse ecosystems to early successional and impoverished conditions. Without changes in land and fire management, fire will become endemic to many regions, threatening both the native species and the livelihoods of people who live in the Amazon.

AB  - This paper deals with a specific issue in project marketing, namely project co-development, presented as a relational and cooperative form of exchange in the project network. It endeavours to find out under what conditions project co-development is considered as a viable marketing strategy as opposed to competitive bidding. A model is developed, which is then used to analyze two cases of project co-development in the construction industry. Of the two cases, one is a successful case and the other is a failure case. This enabled us to analyze factors and conditions that can lead to a successful co-development strategy. Factors such as, project complexity, conflicting objectives, lack of compatibility, lack of trust and commitment and lack of coherence between the budget and the objectives turned out to influence a co-development strategy. The role played by the key decision-makers (project manager) also influenced the success/failure of co-development strategy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This is an introductory course in urban transportation planning that examines the evolution of urban transportation systems in the United States, with particular emphasis on the complex relationships between transportation, land use, and urban form. The content of the course is divided into four parts. The first is a historical look at the planning and development of transportation systems and urban form in the U.S. The second part looks more conceptually and theoretically at the relationships between land use and transportation. The third part examines a number of land use and transportation policy questions facing planners today. And the fourth part explores the normative perspectives and values shaping our views of cities and their transportation systems.

AB  - This paper asks the question, to what extent do market forces limit planning policies? It delves into the constraining relationship of market forces on planning by reference to urban policies in the UK. In this context market forces are defined as dominant long term spatial economic trends which promote decentralisation. The essay uses policy case studies to develop its arguments. In general planning is shown to suffer from the lack of a systematic analysis of land use markets. Yet at its heart planning not only regulates/constrains the property market it also shapes and stimulates it. Planning is found to be most successful when it is shaping urban growth and decentralisation. It is a fundamentally different task to stem market flows and the probability of success is very different. Market forces do limit routes to Utopian aspirations but planners need the motivation, understanding and means to work with the market to produce desired outcomes. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This working paper serves as an introductory reference for those studying the application of land- use–transportation models to the simulation of urban systems. The paper is by no means comprehensive, but aims to provide the reader with a foundation in the basic principles underlying land-use–transportation models and to set those principles in the context of urban management and urban studies. The paper opens with taxonomy of urban simulation models and a treatment of descriptive and analytical models. This serves to situate land-use–transportation models in the context of a broader simulation environment. The paper then reviews land-use–transportation models according to their simulation techniques and individual components. Towards the second half of the paper, the discussion moves to a critical overview of urban simulation and deals with model weaknesses and strengths in a holistic fashion, before concluding with a discussion of some innovations in academic research that are likely to shape future models.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization\nproblems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which\ncan characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to\nstochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization\nproblem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - The present work explores the synergies between socio-metabolic energy use and landscape patterns, starting from the hypothesis that there is a complex and changing relationship between the efficiency in both the societal use of energy, and land-use, and the ecosystem functioning of the whole land matrix of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). It first compares changes in the social metabolism (i.e. the total energy or material throughput of the economy) and in landscape structure and function from 1850 to the present in three municipalities of the Vallès county (N of the BMR), as a first attempt to establish a link between the societal uses of land and energy together with their impact on landscape patterns. Secondly, the study explores the role of natural versus rural landscapes on the maintaining of basic functional properties such as connectivity in the whole BMR. We base our analyses on parametric methodologies that describe both structural and functional properties of landscapes, aimed at assessing the landscape efficiency of both energy-use and land-use planning. The first comparison reveals that the simultaneous loss of energy efficiency and land-use efficiency from the mid-19th century to present can be tracked by changes in the functional landscape structure. The second study shows the importance of the traditional rural landscapes in maintaining the ecological quality of non-built-up land. In consequence, the organized complexity of the land system necessary to host biodiversity and basic ecological processes cannot be guaranteed if the agro-forestry mosaic is not taken into account, together with the network of protected areas. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Data on land use change in the UK and its consitutent nations is variable in scope and quality, but has improved in recent years. It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland.

AB  - The Institute of Transport Studies has developed a Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator (TRESIS) as a decision support system to assist planners to predict the impact of transport strategies and to make recommendations based on those predictions. A key focus of the simulator is the richness of policy instruments such as new public transport, new toll roads, congestion pricing, gas guzzler taxes, changing residential densities, introducing designated bus lanes, implementing fare changes, altering parking policy, introducing more flexible work practices, and the introduction of more fuel efficient vehicles. The appropriate- ness of mixtures of policy instruments is gauged in terms of a series of performance indicators such as impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, accessibility, equity, air quality and household consumer surplus. In this paper we introduce TRESIS to the research community, focussing on the structure of the system and the diversity of applications. Applications are presented to illus- trate the diversity and richness of TRESIS as a policy advisory tool.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

AB  - Abstract The area of land used for agriculture in Victoria has probably declined by 15–22% from a peak in the 1940s. There appears to have been two distinct periods of time where the area of land used for agriculture has fallen: the late 1940s, and the 1970s–1980s. The significance of these declines in terms for land use policy is at least twofold. First, they could signal that a transition in land use is occurring that could facilitate revegetation, and potentially also biodiversity conservation. Second, the change could signal that there is a growing area of land held by landowners who are not the traditional targets of natural resource management policy initiatives. This is particularly relevant if the land is in an area where there are critical land management or biodiversity conservation issues. The South West Goulburn subcatchment of the Goulburn–Broken catchment is suggested as a possible example of this type of situation.

This paper examines longitudinal data for undeveloped parcels since before adoption of the planning system. The sample includes parcels under different land use regulations, and it compares Oregon to Washington. The results indicate generally that property values have increased at similar rates both inside and outside urban growth boundaries, and across parcels zoned for different uses and across state lines. The results are consistent both with theory and with other studies indicating land use regulations can have positive, neutral or negative effects. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Third, shakeouts in patent specialisations in leading cities are less dramatic compared to those in lagging cities. Fourth, invention activities among cities co-evolve.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - Studies of land-use change in China have long been hampered by the lack of accurate and reliable data. This research analyzes systematic data on land use gathered in the 1996 survey, the first nation-wide land survey ever conducted in the history of the People's Republic. The actual size of the Chinese territory on the mainland in 1996 was 9.5 million square kilometers, not 9.6 million as generally believed. It took the world's third largest position next to Russia and Canada. Over two-thirds or 67 percent of China's land coverage were devoted to agricultural activities. The bulk of the construction land was widely scattered in the countryside as a result of rural industrialization and urbanization. The 1996 land survey revealed a total cultivated land of 130 million hectares, nearly 40 percent more than what was reported by local cadres to the State Statistical Bureau. Much of the "discovered" farmland was located in the hilly and mountainous regions where the quality of land is low. Cultivated land per capita continued to drop because of the growing population. Only 14 percent of China's land was cultivable and cultivated land per capita was a mere 0.106 ha which was significantly smaller than the world's average of 0.236 ha. A comparison of data for 1949 and 1996 revealed a pattern of land-use change characterized by the expansion of cultivated and construction land at the expense of pasture and unused land subsequent to the environmentally disastrous campaigns of land reclamation. The processes of agricultural restructuring, rural industrialization, and rapid urbanization since the 1990s have given rise to a new trend of massive farmland loss for the benefits of market farming and non-agricultural developments. Newly reclaimed low-graded farmland in environmentally fragile frontier regions has never been able to compensate for the loss of fertile land in the southeastern part of the country where multiple cropping index and population density are high. There is pressing need for China to use its limited land resources most efficiently and effectively for the sake of not only its own growing population but also the globalizing world. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the relations between land-use and socio-economic metabolism and particularly, socio-economic biomass flows, by constructing four scenarios for Austria in 2020. The scenarios were established using a biomass-flow model for Austria which was developed for this analysis. The model distinguishes between 15 different kinds of land use and relates demand for biomass in Austria to biomass production in Austria, considering imports and exports as well as biomass conversions in industrial processing and in livestock. We discuss four scenarios: (1) a trend scenario, based upon an extrapolation of current trends; (2) a scenario assuming the far-reaching liberalization of agricultural markets; (3) a scenario in which biomass utilization for energy and industry is maximized; and (4) a scenario based upon the approach of "cascade utilization" of biomass. We find that increasing the use of biomass as an energy source might have considerable unwanted ecological effects including, among others, a reduction in the functioning of forests as a terrestrial carbon sink. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay. ?? 2006.

AB  - Grazing systems occupy more of the terrestrial biosphere than any other form of land use, with and and semi-arid regions supporting disproportionately larger grazing area than other biomes. Two common responses of dryland ecosystems to grazing practices are desertification and woody encroachment, with the former occurring in more and zones and the latter becoming prevalent in mesic areas. Desertification and woody encroachment are linked to ecosystem impoverishment and land-use abandonment. Desertification leads to fragmented ecosystem structure and decreased carbon storage. Woody encroachment results in increased structural heterogeneity of the landscape, elevated carbon stores aboveground, and variable belowground carbon responses. Nitrogen accumulates under woody plants in both desertification and woody encroachment scenarios, but large-scale changes in nitrogen stocks and trace gas fluxes differ substantially between these types of land degradation. New remote sensing approaches based on imaging spectroscopy allow regional-scale estimates of carbon and nitrogen dynamics that will increase our understanding of desertification and woody encroachment in global grazing systems.

AB  - The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) is a multi-disciplinary, multinational scientific project led by Brazil. LBA researchers seek to understand Amazonia in its global context especially with regard to regional and global climate. Current development activities in Amazonia including deforestation, logging, cattle ranching, and agriculture significantly perturb regional and global carbon budgets and the atmospheric radiation budget through both greenhouse gas inputs and the increase in atmospheric particulates generated by fires. The Brazilian Amazon currently releases about 0.2 Pg-C to the atmosphere each year as a result of net deforestation. Logging and forest fire activity are poorly quantified but certainly increase this amount by more than 10%. Fires associated with land management activities generate smoke that leads to heating of the lower atmosphere, decreases in overall cloudiness, increases in cloud lifetimes, and the suppression of rainfall. There are considerable uncertainties associated with our understanding of smoke effects. Present development trends point to agricultural intensification in the Brazilian Amazon. This intensification and the associated generation of wealth present an opportunity to enhance governance on the frontier and to minimize the damaging effects of fires.

AB  - The objective is to assess the ability of land use transportation models to address some current policy issues. The nature of the relationship between land use and transportation is examined briefly in terms of empirical evidence and the results from modeling exercises. Two studies that the use of such models and that are being carried out in Britain are examined. Despite these and some convincing arguments by expers, there is little evidence of widespread use of such models. A number of current policy issues are discussed, and then a set of policy instruments that can be used to meet the policy objectives are identified. Evidence on the ability of land use transportation models to represent the impacts of the policy instruments is presented. It is shown how such models can contribute significantly in some areas of policy analsys, for example, reducing congestion and energy use, but can contribute very little to the objective of moving toward a market economy.

AB  - Broad concepts of larger scale regional types of classifications that include management/production patterns- mostly from a policy viewpoint. Landscapes are continually changing as a result of human intervention in natural processes. Both intensive and extensive land uses are expressed in the structure of the land, the size of the parcels and the area of natural and semi-natural vegetation that is present. The task facing ecologists, conservationists, planners, decision-makers and others involved with these changes is to find the best methods for maintaining landscape diversity. Representing an important step forward for regional and inter-regional development of integrated landscape ecological research in the field of land use changes, this volume includes discussion of many problems related to this area. The research papers and case studies featured in Consequences of Land Use Changes were originally presented at a symposium which formed part of the Seventh International Congress on Ecology. Further contributions from this symposium are contained in Landscape Perspectives of Land Use Changes (ISBN: 1-85312-848-1) also published by WIT Press. Noting that the current system of nature conservation areas do not coincide very well with the designated network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest for Europe, landscape ecologists, conservationists, and planners seek optimal ways to maintain landscape diversity. In a section on main concepts, methods, and monitoring, they consider such topics as analyzing the concept of landscape change, reference areas and dimensions in landscape ecology and the application of evaluation functions, and the sensitivity of landscapes to atmospheric pollution. Others look at the consequences of land use changes themselves from such perspectives as the transformation of landscape ecological structure following the land privatization in Hungary since 1989, relationships between farming systems and ecological patterns along a gradient of bocage landscapes, multiple- scale landscape ecological analysis in a rural Mediterranean region, and a conceptual model relating ecological constraints to livestock production in tropical American seasonal savannas.

The study draws on 42 explorative interviews with land purchasers, land policy experts, planning professionals and local farmers. The study shows that uncertainty, and feelings of justice are pivotal aspects during land transactions. Moreover, land transactions are co-evolving with the planning process. Landowners exhibit strategic behaviour based on their personal situation and their expectations on uncertain aspects. The strategies are strongly interrelated with the evolution of land use change. Land use changes are both input on which actors base their strategies, as well as the outcome of those strategies. The aspects found in this study were strongly interrelated and changed over time. Some aspects were context dependent, while others are expected to influence land transactions in general. In this light, the strength of a successful planner is twofold: on the one hand a planner needs to be a good communicator; on the other hand a planner should be able to deal with uncertainty and expectations during plan processes.

AB  - This research project, carried out in the framework of the INTAS/VEGETATION Programmes at the Faculty of Geography, Moscow State University, aims to assess and to map land use and land cover of Russia using a combination of remote sensing, traditional maps and in-field survey of different spatial and temporal resolutions as geographical indicators of environmental status and dynamics. Coarse-, medium - and high-resolution imagery (NOAA-AVHRR, RESURS-01-3/MSU-SK, RESURS-F/MK-4) have been processed, interpreted and analysed for the compilation of reference maps in a Geographical Information Systems database, which contains multiple information layers, including remote-sensing data, cartographic ancillary data layers, and statistics. A feasibility study was undertaken to elaborate methodology for scale-dependent landscape applications and the study of land-cover dynamics in the changing land-use system in Russia.

AB  - Land use change models are tools for understanding and explaining the causes and consequences of land use dynamics. Recently, new models, combining knowledge and tools from biophysical and socio-economic sciences, have become available. This has resulted in spatially explicit models focussed on patterns of change as well as agent-based models focused on the underlying decision processes. These developments improve the use of land use change models in environmental impact studies. This special issue documents these developments: (i) analysing the system properties in a biophysical and socio-economic context at multiple scales; (ii) integrating spatially explicit land use change models in integrated assessment models; (iii) visualising and quantifying the potential effects of land use change in trade-off curves, to support land users and policy makers in their decisions; and (iv) modelling of the actual decision making process with agent-based modelling. A new promising future development is the incorporation of dynamic feedbacks between changing land use and changing environmental conditions and vice versa. Unfortunately such dynamic feedbacks between the socio-economic and biophysical model components are still not or only partially operational in current models and are therefore the most important challenge for land use and environmental modellers.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between the planning of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the realisation that the physical environment is an important determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental well-being and community, the local economy and income, health inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of housing, economic development, land use and transport is a determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities. It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - This article reviews empirical studies of the relationship between transportation facilities—highways, heavy rail, and light rail transit systems—and property values. The main ob- jective is to develop an explanation for inconsistent results presented in this literature over the past several decades. Results from these studies vary based on whether travel time or travel distance is used as a measure of accessibility. When researchers measure access to highways and rail transit in terms of travel time, study results usually indicate the expected inverse relationship between access to transportation facilities and property values. When studies use travel distance as a measure of access to transportation facilities, results tend to show mixed property value effects. The delineation of study areas also appears to influence the direction of results. This article offers a new interpretation of the transportation facility-property value literature that improves our ability to measure this relationship and to anticipate land-market responses to transportation facilities.

AB  - Spatially explicit land-use change prediction is often based on environmental characteristics of land-use types, such as soil type and slope, as observed at one time instant. This approach presumes that relationships between land use and environment are constant over time.We argue that such temporal stationarity is uncommon in many land-use systems, and we demonstrate by means of a case study how this may affect the performance of land-use change inference. For this purpose, the spatial distribu- tion of cropland and uncultivated land in Mediterranean Europe in 2000 was studied, as well as recent land-use changes from cropland to uncultivated land and vice versa between 1990 and 2000. Both land-use and land-use change frequencies were captured in regression equations that related them to environmental characteristics. A compar- ison between these two regression types suggests that many traditional constraints (slope, soil quality, accessibility) have become less important, while climatic variables have gained importance. These results can be explained by lower costs of constraints due to technological and economic developments, and by changes in relative average revenues of different land uses.

AB  - Impact fees have become a common funding mechanism for growth-related transportation improvements. The most common impact fee program includes a range of street and road projects, the cost of which are partially paid by new development based upon their usage of these facilities. The purpose of this paper is to describe an innovative application of impact fees to pay for transit and nonmotorized improvements in Portland OR. The City of Portland initiated a study of System Development Charges, or SDC's to help pay for growth impacts on a variety of multimodal facilities. The city is largely built-out with respect to roads, but has an aggressive program to improve transit and nonmotorized facilities. The City and a consultant team developed several innovative methods to attribute the impacts of growth to projects such as corridor-level transit facilities, sidewalks, bike lanes, and a downtown streetcar system. Special steps were needed to convert the traditional ITE vehicle trip generation rates into comparable rates for the transit and nonmotorized modes. The paper details the methodology, analysis techniques, and assumptions required. In addition, the paper describes the steps used to gain acceptance of the controversial impact fee program by a diverse group of citizens and business interests.

AB  - The management of land-use change has been achieved in Britain through the development control system. Set up in its modern form in 1947, the system has remained substantially unchanged in spite of a radically altered policy environment. This paper considers the nature of the system and notes both its robustness and its flexibility as well as the accusations of delay and uncertainty that are levelled at it. It considers the drivers for change which are likely to affect the system, and in particular the challenge of climate change, the rights of third parties, the question of major infrastructure projects, and the desire for neighbourhood protection. The paper concludes by asserting that there is a need to refocus the debate on the quality of outcomes rather than on the process. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Exposure to air pollution has become an exceedingly inescapable part of urban living. The presence of pollutants in urban air is reported to cause adverse effects on human health, as as damage to structures and materials. Their presence can also be an aesthetic nuisance around urban centres. Modelling of urban air pollution is an important facet of pollution control and abatement. Models explain the occurrence, Intensity, and movement of pollutants. Current techniques used for modelling urban air pollution use dispersion characteristics to predict pollutant levels at locations away from defined sources. They work well in relatively simple situations with few sources in consideration. However, these models cannot handle the mathematics in an airshed with many point and non-point sources of urban air pollutants, This is because many simplifying assumptions have to be made, which limit the accuracy of predictions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling is a technique that offers many advantages in modelling non-linear type processes Such as those that govern complex urban air pollution situations. This technique uses historical data sets and can recognize the patterns that occur between different pollutants the urban airshed. ANN modelling is a "black-box" method, where equations describing the complex situations are not known or required. The model simply extrapolates patterns, and "learns" based on historical data, much the same,way: the human mind learns. Therefore, ANN may be suitable for air pollution modelling of situations where the governing equations are too complex or expensive to derive. This paper describes the use of ANN to predict behavior of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within a defined region of the City of Edmonton, Alberta.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

AB  - This study reviews the major changes in global distribution of croplands during the twentieth century, when the cropland base diminished greatly (from ~0.75 ha/person in 1900 to ~0.35 ha/person in 1990). This loss of croplands was not globally uniform: more than half the worlds population, living in developing nations, lost nearly two-thirds of their per capita cropland base. The distribution of croplands has become increasingly skewedin 1990, 80% of the population lived off less than 0.35 ha/person. While agricultural yields have generally increased, they have barely kept pace with population growth in developing nations. Overall, the global food production system is becoming increasingly vulnerable to regional disruptions because of our increasing reliance on expensive technological options to increase agricultural production, or on global food trade.

AB  - In this paper, two research approaches to specify the relation between land use types and their explanatory factors are applied to the same modelling framework. The two approaches are used to construct land suitability maps, which are used as inputs in two model applications. The first is an inductive approach that uses regression analysis. The second applies a theoretical, actor decision framework to derive relations deductively using detailed field data. Broadly speaking, this classification coincides with the distinction between empirical and theoretical models and the distinction between deriving process from pattern and pattern from process. The two modelling approaches are illustrated by a scenario analysis for a case study in a municipality in the Philippines. Goodness-of-fit of the deductive approach in predicting current land use is slightly lower compared to the inductive approach. Resulting land use projections from the modelling exercise for the two approaches differ in 15 percent of the cells, which is caused by differences in the specification of the suitability maps. The paper discusses the assumptions underlying the two approaches as well as the implications for the applicability of the models in policy-oriented research. The deductive approach describes processes explicitly and can therefore better handle discontinuities in land use processes. This approach allows the user to evaluate a wide range of scenarios, which can also include new land use types. The inductive approach is easily reproducible by others but cannot guarantee causality. Therefore, the inductive approach is less suitable to handle discontinuities or additional land use types, but is well able to rapidly identify hotspots of land use change. It is concluded that both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks for different purposes. Generally speaking, the inductive approach is applicable in situations with relatively small land use changes, without introduction of new land use types, whereas the deductive approach is more flexible. The choice of modelling approach should therefore be based on the research and policy questions for which it is used. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A combined transportation-land use model is proposed in this paper. Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

AB  - The pattern of urban development strongly affects sustainability - energy and water use, food production, waste generation and disposal, biodiversity and equal opportunity. So regional planning must be a tool in achieving sustainability. The traditional urban pattern was a cluster of activities that people do together (city downtowns and neighborhood centers) surrounded by residences in a density gradient. That remains the most sustainable pattern. After World War II, the automobile promoted a pattern of scattered activities and spread out residences. Most other countries resisted the spread and scattered pattern, though without complete success; the US has only begun to recentralize. Three strategies are proposed to recentralize: Pricing goods and services to reflect sustainable needs, improving the magnetism of cities and legislating enforceable regional plans. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A simple example and a more complicated urban-design case study are included to demonstrate the viability of this approach in solving the simultaneous-optimization problem. As a secondary benefit, this set-partitioning model can be reformulated as an integer, generalized-network, flow problem for which new efficient computer codes, capable of solving networks with thousands of nodes and variables, are available.

AB  - Provision of recreational open space is a major factor in determining resident quality of life in cities. However, urban growth and land use change models typically omit park location and allocation issues when simulating changing urban environments. This paper introduces a method for exploring the spatial allocation of urban parks (public, recreational open spaces) given differing municipal and county investment decisions. Park planning literature has established level of service metrics as rough indicators of provision of public park amenities that are useful guides for future park investment decisions within a given jurisdiction. In this study, we create a dynamic-demand location model that simulates political feedback from population growth and LOS metrics to allocate new parklands (similar to 0.5 ha <= neighborhood parks <= similar to 4 ha) in multi-jurisdictional urbanizing regions. We frame parks as a new development type that augments residential development currently driving a version of the Regional Urban Growth (RUG) urban simulation model, an open source, raster-based simulation platform. Our approach allows planners and researchers to explore urban patterns and distributive outcomes associated with different local open space requirements and investment choices. We illustrate this approach under scenarios for the rapidly growing, three-county Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region of North Carolina, USA. We test varying delays in park planning, purchase, and construction, varying maximum park sizes, and the effects of increased investment levels in two jurisdictions within our study area. This model suggests that the most important aspect of successful park planning is the length of the lag time between residential and park development. Perhaps the most successful park planning strategy is to plan parks along with residential areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the key activities of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project has been to stimulate the syntheses of knowledge of land-use/cover change processes, and in particular to advance understanding of the causes of land change (see Chap. 1). Such efforts have generally followed one of two approaches: broad scale cross-sectional analyses (cross-national statistical comparisons, mainly); and detailed case studies at the local scale. The LUCC project applied a middle path that combines the richness of indepth case studies with the power of generalization gained from larger samples, thus drawing upon the strengths of both approaches. In particular, systematic comparative analyses of published case studies on landuse dynamics have helped to improve our knowledge about causes of land-use change. Principally, two methods exist for comparative analyses of case studies. These methods are sufficiently broad geographically to support generalization, but at a scale fine enough to capture complexity and variability across space and time.

AB  - Co-evolution has an important function in the evolution of species and it is clearly manifested in certain scenarios such as host-parasite and predator-prey interactions, symbiosis and mutualism. The extrapolation of the concepts and methodologies developed for the study of species co-evolution at the molecular level has prompted the development of a variety of computational methods able to predict protein interactions through the characteristics of co-evolution. Particularly successful have been those methods that predict interactions at the genomic level based on the detection of pairs of protein families with similar evolutionary histories (similarity of phylogenetic trees: mirrortree). Future advances in this field will require a better understanding of the molecular basis of the co-evolution of protein families. Thus, it will be important to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the similarity observed in phylogenetic trees of interacting proteins, distinguishing direct specific molecular interactions from other general functional constraints. In particular, it will be important to separate the effects of physical interactions within protein complexes ('co-adaptation') from other forces that, in a less specific way, can also create general patterns of co-evolution.

AB  - This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use component of a partially integrated land use-transportation modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel demand model (TDM), and travel times from the traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage over time. A factorized design approach is used to model uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model, as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results suggest that while several model inputs may affect model outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send shocks through the urban system. However, the level of uncertainty appears to come down in later years, as households, jobs, and developers respond to changed input conditions

AB  - Land-use change is one of the main drivers of many environmental change processes. It influences the basic resources of land use, including the soil. Its impact on soil often occurs so creepingly that land managers hardly contemplate initiating ameliorative or counterbalance measures. Poor land management has degraded vast amounts of land, reduced our ability to produce enough food, and is a major threat to rural livelihoods in many developing countries. To date, there has been no single unifying volume that addresses the multifaceted impacts of land use on soils. This book has responded to this challenge by bringing together renowned academics and policy experts to analyze the patterns, driving factors and proximate causes, and the socioeconomic impacts of soil degradation. Policy measures to prevent irreversible degradation and rehabilitate degraded soils are also identified.

AB  - Transportation and land use research of the past decade has focused in large part on the question of whether manipulating land uses in the direction of smart growth alternatives can reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or otherwise improve travel behavior. Yet the notion of manipulating land uses implies that the alternative is somehow self-organized or market-based. This view appears to underestimate the extent to which current planning interventions in the United States largely focused on lowering development densities, mandating ample road and parking designs, and separating land uses impose an auto-oriented template on most new development. Rather than a market failure, the paucity of smart growth alternatives may be a planning failure the result of municipal regulatory exclusion. This problem definition would shift the burden of proof for policy reform, as uncertainty in travel-behavior benefits would hardly justify the con- tinuation of exclusionary regulations. If municipal regulations in fact constrain alternatives to low- density, auto-oriented development, one would expect developers to perceive unsatisfied market interest in such development. This article studies, through a national survey (676 respondents), US developers perceptions of the market for pedestrian-and transit-oriented development forms. Overall, respondents perceive considerable market interest in alternative development forms, but believe that there is inadequate supply of such alternatives relative to market demand. Developer- respondents attribute this gap between supply and demand principally to local government regu- lation. When asked how the relaxation of these regulations would affect their product, majorities of developers indicated that such liberalization would lead them to develop in a denser and more mixed-use fashion, particularly in close-in suburban locales. Results are interpreted in favor land- policy reform based on the expansion of choice in transportation and land use. This view contrasts with a more prevalent approach which conditions policy interventions on scientific evidence of travel-behavior modification.

Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.

AB  - Individuals simultaneously choose and are affected by their web of connections. This paper explores this co-evolution of individual and network in the context of longitudinal attitudinal and sociometric data collected from a government agency, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Analysis of these data suggests that networks vary in their elasticity - where the internal network of the agency was rigid, but the extra-organizational network quite fluid. Further, the data suggest that, consistent with theories of socialization, individuals differ in plasticity - how they are affected by the network - where the cross-sectional analysis of the data suggest that individuals were molded by the organization, but that the attitudes of individuals who left were unaffected by the change in milieu.

AB  - Co-development of drugs and biomarkers should be considered when the biomarker is intricately related to the use of the drug. There are risks and benefits to co-development and these need to be considered carefully early in the process. The current chapter attempts to delineate when it is appropriate to plan for co-development and to discuss a range of issues. Challenges include the determination of the type of assay (laboratory-developed test vs. reference laboratory vs. kit), the designs of trials for evaluation of clinical utility, and the regulatory pathway. Successful co-development requires planning very early in the process and assembling the appropriate multi-disciplinary team. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Although performance measures encourage agreement in other disciplines, measures for state transportation and land use may engender disagreement among stakeholders. A literature review and a survey of 25 states and three metropolitan planning organizations identified 41 such measures.  No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.  Further, when measures are computed under four benevolent scenarios that each generate the support of some stakeholders (reduced transit costs, reduced congestion, increased local autonomy, and increased compact development) some performance  measures indicate improvement and others do not.

AB  - Urban cities around the world are busy finding ways to manage traffic congestion that increasingly reduces the quality of life of the citizens and the productivity of the city. Many governments of developed countries had already learned that building your way out of congestion is totally cost ineffective and counterproductive, and is certainly not a recommended long-term strategy for congestion management. Instead, transportation professionals are calling the attention of the policymakers to focus on integration of land use and transportation as an effective mean to manage congestion. While coordinated land use planning can certainly help to enhance the movements of people and goods for the two primary modes of transportation, automobiles and public transport, the presentation will concentrate on the public transport sector instead of the highway sector. It will introduce the concept of Transit Oriented Development including background and principles, and the discussion will touch on of the following technical elements: Factors that favoring and hindering development around transit. The elements of Transit-Oriented Planning. Accommodating the terminal/station function. Principles for successful development around stations/terminals.

AB  - This paper examines ways that transportation decisions affect land use patterns and resulting economic, social and environmental impacts. These include direct impacts on land used for transportation facilities, and indirect impacts caused by changes to land use development patterns. In particular, certain transportation planning decisions tend to increase sprawl (dispersed, urban-fringe, automobile-dependent development), while others support smart growth (more compact, infill, multi-modal development). These development patterns have various economic, social and environmental impacts. This paper describes specific methods for evaluating these impacts in transport planning.

AB  - Although trust research has been extensive and substantial, the constitution and actual merits of trust in land use planning remain nebulous. What do participants of a local land use planning process actually mean when they say they trust the planning committee? How important is participants' trust in the planning committee in shaping their perceptions of the planning process and their cooperation in it? To explore the everyday meaning of trust in the specific context of local land use planning, semi-structured interviews with the participants of a local planning project in Switzerland were conducted (n = 9). Based on these results, the constitution and the relevance of trust in the responsible planning committee among a wider circle of participants were assessed (n = 66). The results show that participants trust the planning committee if they perceive its members as competent, honest, open, fair, reliable, reciprocating, respectful and committed. Interestingly, a considerable part of trust in the planning committee hinges explicitly on whether the committee incorporates the personal interests of the participant. Trust is indeed vital to participants' belief that a meaningful discussion and cooperation with the members of the planning committee is possible. However, trust is neither a guarantee for people's approval of planning decisions nor for their cooperation. One implication of the findings is that in order to evaluate trust-building practice comprehensively, it is necessary to first understand the specific everyday meaning of trust for 'real people' in real planning processes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Carmakers and suppliers currently experiment with new forms of relationships in order to prepare and develop coherent and valuable innovations that feature incrementally evolving new products (new services, architectural breakthroughs, etc.). We observe diversity both in the very nature of co-innovation partnerships and in the in-house organisational settings. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these configurations for the partners? The aim of our research is to analyse the impact of the organisational forms of co-innovation on the performance of innovation processes. We first define co-innovation situations in contrast to the co-development model. We then present the innovation route analytical framework in order to empirically analyse co-innovation processes and assess their performance. Once this groundwork is laid, we compare four cases: two innovations both developed by a European (EASYCAR) and an Asian car manufacturer (NIPCAR). The comparison of the scenarios shows the variety of innovation cooperation processes and their related performance profiles. Keywords:

AB  - Problem: Since the late 1980s, U.S. metropolitan regions have increasingly engaged in a style of land use-transportation scenario planning that merges techniques borrowed from military and business strategic planning with long-range transportation systems planning and project-level alternatives analysis. Aside from occasional anecdotal descriptions, the effectiveness of such approaches in generating compact growth plans has not been evaluated comprehensively. Purpose: We analyzed a wide range of scenario planning studies to determine how far compact growth scenarios are predicted to reduce vehicular travel below existing trends. Methods: Using hierarchical modeling, we developed a regional vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) model based on 85 scenarios in 23 planning studies from 18 metropolitan areas. Results and conclusions: Using coefficients from this model, we conservatively estimate that compact growth scenarios reduce VMT in 2050 by 17% below scenarios assuming a continuation of existing trends. Takeaway for practice: Existing transportation models remain largely insensitive to changes in land use and transportation policy. This must change for scenario planning to achieve its full potential. In the future, scenario planning should incorporate the best current knowledge about how global economic and environmental trends will affect regions. Research support: Collection of the primary data used in this article was funded in part by the Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, under Cooperative Agreement No. DTFH61-03-H-00134.

AB  - In the past fifty years we have seen enormous growth in computing capability – computing is everywhere and has impacted nearly everything. In this talk, Dr. Douglas Engelbart, who pioneered much of what we now take for granted as interactive computing, examines the forces that have shaped this growth. He argues that our criteria for investment in innovation are, in fact, short-sighted and focused on the wrong things. He proposes, instead, investment in an improvement infrastructure that can result in sustained, radical innovation capable of changing computing and expanding the kinds of problems that we can address through computing. In this talk, Dr. Engelbart describes both the processes that we need to put in place and the capabilities that we must support in order to stimulate this higher rate of innovation. The talk closes with a call to action for this Co- Evolution Symposium audience, since this is a group that has both a stake in innovation and the ability to shape its direction.

AB  - People alter the landscape primarily to appropriate ecosystem goods such as foods fiber, and timber for human consumption. Unintended consequences for ecosystems vary according to the type of land-use change, e.g., forest clearing for agriculture, grassland conversion for grazing, or urban expansion, as well as the underlying ecological characteristics, e.g., humid vs. dry, phosphorus vs. nitrogen-limited, or tropical vs. temperate. The ecosystem responses potentially alter future abilities to provide ecosystem goods and influence future land-use decisions. This volume addresses five major ecosystem responses to land-use change: hydrological, climiatic, biogeochemical, human health, and biological diversity. The chapters summarize current knowledge from the perspectives of different disciplines and present analyses from many parts of the world in different ecological and socioeconomic settings. This introductory chapter develops a framework for understanding and communicating the multiple ecosystem responses as an essential input to societal decisions about land use.

Its focus is on indicators that relate socioeconomic metabolism to land use. Six of the papers focus on methods to derive indicators. Of these, four examine approaches and applications of ecological footprints, one considers the 'material and energy flow accounting' toolbox that also includes human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), and another one considers an approach for comparing the sustainability of landscapes based on remotely sensed GIS data. Two papers focus on conceptual and theoretical issues that are common to a number of tools: one discusses basic conceptual issues of observing progress towards sustainability, whereas the other compares basic conceptual considerations and research questions driving HANPP on the one hand, and the ecological footprint on the other. Three papers present case studies, two on Austria and one compares three countries (Austria, South Korea and the Philippines) to the global level. One paper uses broad empirical datasets to test hypotheses on the relations between HANPP and landscape structure.

AB  - NEV travel is rapidly increasing in the City of Lincoln. What was once considered a sleepy community has opened itself up to a tremendous opportunity for Smart Growth. This pilot NEV Transportation Plan will be an example to all cities in California. With, the expected population growth, aging citizens, and future residential development, the timing is ideal. Many positive impacts will make themselves present, such as the ability for residents to easily travel to local services, medical facilities, and commercial centers as the City's NEV-planned infrastructure development is fully implemented. Neighboring cities are working together to promote a network of safe routes for NEV travel. The NEV is a viable transportation alternative. The City plans to educate residents young and old about the benefits of driving NEVs. Families can use an NEV as a second vehicle for intracity travel and short trips, and high school/college students can use them to commute. The number of older Americans is expected to double over the next twenty-five years. Hopefully in the near future, the "restricted" driver's license program for the elderly will be codified and supported by all DMV offices. Within the text of AB 2353, Chapter 7 Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Transportation Plan, it states:"It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this chapter, to encourage discussions between the Legislature, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the California Highway Patrol regarding the adoption of a new classification for licensing motorists who use neighborhood electric vehicles." In accordance with the intent stated in AB 2353, it is recommended that the State of California expand the current restricted license program and establish an. NEV driver's license program. In addition, it is recommended that an incentive program be established to encourage drivers with physical challenges to exchange their automobile driver's license for an NEV driver's license. This program should be aimed at those who no longer feel comfortable driving in high-speed traffic. One retired highway patrolmen suggested a one to two-year automatic extension incentive when exchanging licenses. The need for mobility in an aging population makes this suggestion worth pursuing. The Cities of Lincoln and Rocklin are working toward nationwide uniformity of NEV Transportation Plan design elements. The trend of transportation using electric vehicles is catching on quickly. It is a tremendously desirable mode of transportation because it is good for the environment, economical, safe and fun. Transportation planning by local governments, in cooperation with the citizens in many communities, is proliferating throughout the nation. In the future, the standardization of signs, pavement markings, vehicle codes and design standards will assist with an efficient transition and modernization of roadways and infrastructure to allow for safe NEV travel.

AB  - Urban sustainable mobility solutions are being discussed throughout the world to deal with problems of high use of land, congestion situations, energy consumption and emissions derived from road transportation. Part of these solutions concerns the promotion of public transportation as an alternative to individual transportation. Public transport only becomes an attractive option if, for the mobility provided (passenger x km), emits less pollutants and consume less energy. This paper focuses on comparing the fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions (CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM) between urban Diesel buses (10 litres and 2.7 litres turbocharged Diesel) and typical gasoline and diesel European light duty vehicles (1.2 litres gasoline, 1.9 litres turbocharged Diesel). Results are analyzed as a function of transported passengers. For the proposed analysis, typical low traffic and congested traffic driving cycles were selected as an input to the EcoGest model, combined with driver behaviour characteristics and vehicle characteristics. Main results are easy-to-use charts highlighting where each mode is more attractive as a function of the number of passengers inside the bus and the number of people inside the vehicle. Results were obtained using EcoGest, a numerical model developed in our research institute. This model allows simulating the energetical and environmental performance of a road vehicle in a predefined route, accounting for the driving behaviour, vehicle specifications, powertrain specifications, occupation rate and road grade. The model has been used to simulate light duty and heavy duty vehicles, including gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen cars, and diesel and natural gas buses. Predicted results have been compared with measured fuel consumption and tail-pipe emissions in real-traffic situations, standard cycles (FTP75, NEDC), and predicted results of similar models (e.g. ADVISOR). Predictions of EcoGest are, usually, very good. Copyright ASCE 2008.

AB  - The expansion and intensification of human land use in recent decades is resulting in major changes in biodiversity. Biodiversity, a term that has entered into common usage only in the last twenty years, refers to the diversity of life at all levels of organization, from genetic to species to ecosystem (Levin 2000). Although we refer throughout this chapter most commonly to species diversity, land use change alters biodiversity at all of these levels. For example, reduced habitat from land use change decreases population sizes and reduces genetic diversity within a species.

AB  - This is an analysis of the relationships between changes in land use, land cover and socio-economic metabolism in Austria between 1950 and 1995, covering the period during which Austria's agriculture was industrialized. From 1950 to about 1980, Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s, largely through agricultural intensification. Since then, the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction, to preserve the existing farm structure, as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence, since the 1980s yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area. Austria joined the European Union in 1995, after which agricultural policy was, to a large extent, determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy. From 1950 to 1995 we observe a continuous trend of declining cropland and grassland areas, increases in the areas of built-up and infrastructure land, and a slow increase in forested areas. The segregation of cropland cultivation and livestock husbandry leads to a concentration of cropland in fertile lowlands and of grasslands in the lower alpine regions from which crops are retreating. As a result of livestock being fed increasing amounts of cropland produce and imported protein feedstuffs, there was a disintegration of local nutrient cycles and a rising input of mineral fertilizer. We interpret these changes as a consequence of the massive input of fossil energy into Austria's agricultural system, which allowed a surge in the intensification of transport. We analyze these trends using GIS maps based upon statistic data.

AB  -  Summary form only given. This research focuses on the problem of the semantic linking and co-evolution of the different design diagrams and models of an object-oriented software application. The blueprint of an object-oriented software application consists mainly of models drawn in a modeling language. The state-of-the-art modeling language in object-oriented software development is the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Our research hypothesis is that using decidable fragments of first order logic to express the different UML diagrams enables the semantic linking of the different diagrams and models and enables the support of co-evolution which can be semi-automated, enhancing the reusability, maintainability and understandability of the design of the software application and of the software application in general. We propose to develop a formal framework to support the linking of the different diagrams and models within the software development life cycle (SDLC). The advantages of such a framework are: reasoning capabilities are provided, co-evolution is more guaranteed, adaptability of the design is improved and reuse and understandability of the software design increases. To support co-evolution of the design models in a semi-automatic way we investigate the query capabilities of these logic families.

Variables projected concern both land use (e. g. , number of single-family housing units) and choice of transit mode. Forecasts are made for 1990 and 2000 for four spatial zones within San Jose. Delphi panelists are individuals familiar with land use and transportation issues in the San Jose area. A preliminary questionnaire survey is used to set general economic conditions and land use policies that serve as a context for specific forecasts of land use-transportation interactions. Strengths and weaknesses of the Delphi method in forecasting land use are assessed.

AB  - Estimating transit ridership in tourist corridors is a challenge to transportation planners. This challenge occurs often because there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of travel but little hard data on transit use by visitors. Regional travel forecasting models do not work well in these situations because they are typically used for area-wide analyses, with aggregation of socio-economic data into zones that are large and ill-suited to the specific station-area and ridership analyses that are important to transit planners. This paper provides a description of an innovative process to use parcel-level data in a geographic information system (GIS) to prepare travel forecasts for a transit project in Orlando, Florida. The established four-step transportation process was used - trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and trip assignment - to determine transit travel in the corridor. Travel attractions and productions were identified by parcel in the International Drive Resort Area (IDRA). Trips were distributed to locations external to the study area, within the study area, between station areas, and within station areas of the transit line. Adjustments were made to the forecasts based on ridership elasticity due to travel time and wait time. Sensitivity of ridership to changes in activity in the IDRA were also explored. Several alternatives were studied, with variations of routes, technologies, and numbers of stations evaluated. Satisfactory results were obtained using the transit trip forecasting method, aiding in selecting an appropriate alternative to be advanced into design.

AB  - The multitude of rights in land and the recording of these rights are addressed by a number of studies, yet a recognized paradigm for such studies seems missing. Rights in land are recorded and managed through either cadastral systems or land administration systems depending on the legal system of the countries concerned. The cadastre, however, is the core of both systems as it provides for systematic and official descriptions of land parcels or real property units. The research mentioned often has a development perspective, and in this article we will motivate the introduction of the research domain of cadastral development. This research is multi-disciplinary and draws on elements of theories and methodologies fromthe natural, the social, the behavioral, and the formal sciences. During the last decade or so, doctoral dissertations have come to constitute a substantial part of this research effort. The article focuses on the methodological aspect of doctoral research by analyzing ten doctoral dissertations. Our analysis is based on a taxonomy ofmethodological elements and aims at identifying commonalities and differences among the dissertations in the use of concepts andmethods. Having completed the main analysis,we invited the authors of the dissertations to comment upon our analysis of their work and the developed taxonomy. The responses corroborate the viewthat the taxonomy could be used for further analyses and provide for a framework for further doctoral research. The article concludes with a call for a shared terminology and a shared set of concepts whichmay contribute to further theory building within the cadastral domain.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the anthropogenic forcing of geomorphic systems, specifically how nineteenth century land-use changes impacted watershed hydrologic, upland erosional, and sediment delivery subsystems of Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. Identification and analysis of the timing and rate of change in these subsystems, and the reestablishment of presettlement conditions, were used to address landscape sensitivity and watershed inheritance issues in a region undergoing population expansion and development. Archival research was used to reconstruct concurrent land-use changes in the catchments of two nineteenth century water-powered mills. Changes in the physical properties of mill pond sediments including, organic content, particle size distribution, and magnetic susceptibility, were used to interpret trends in sediment source during the span of mill operation. Interpolation of augering and coring data was used to determine mill pond sediment mass and pond capacity. Hillslope hydrologic change occurred almost immediately following land conversion. Upland erosion began with the removal of A-horizon fines, and progressed with the removal of A-horizon coarse particulates, and then B-horizon particulates. Change from one source category to another was punctuated by high flow events signifying an integration of human activity and climate in the changing of system boundary conditions

AB  - As an open source and modular software system using highly disaggregated data for dynamic simulation, UrbanSim has been instrumental in making integrated land-use transportation modeling accessible beyond the bespoke models that characterized earlier generations. The UrbanSim model and the collaborative OPUS framework (Open Platform for Urban Simulation) that it has spawned have stimulated much original progress in this field. The object of this thematic issue of the Journal of Transport and Land Use is to report on this work and to illustrate the various ways UrbanSim has been adapted. However, this special issue is more than just a collection of progress reports. A central theme running through all the papers is that integrated land use-transportation modeling in Europe presents a series of challenges and demands not necessarily present in the United States context in which UrbanSim was developed. Thus, while the UrbanSim system can be technically adapted to European studies given the data and resources, the prevailing land-use transportation environment in Europe differs from the United States.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of land use change requires robust documentation on the characteristics of change. Land use change observation and monitoring programs now rely on remotely sensed data coupled with field observations and corroborating information describing the social, economic, and physical dimensions of land use and land cover. Remote sensing approaches for observing and monitoring change vary depending on the geographic scope, ecological complexity, and the information required to understand ecosystem interactions. Strategies based on identifying spectral variability are useful for targeting areas of rapid change. Measuring changes in land cover biophysical properties requires a more complex approach, where different dates of remotely sensed data are transformed to such variables as surface imperviousness, canopy structure, and phenology, and then compared. Mapping the conversion of land use and land cover from one category to another (e.g., forest to urban) requires maps of the land use and land cover for two or more periods. These approaches have been used successfully at local, regional, and global scales using a range of remote sensing data (e.g., aerial photography, Landsat Thematic Mapper, Terra MODIS, Space Imaging's IKONOS), field measurements, and other supplemental sources. Challenges remain, however, and scientific advances in change detection methods, accuracy assessment procedures, and improved strategies for using land cover to more specifically infer land use are needed so that continued improvements in the types and quality of change measures used to study land use and ecosystem interactions can be realized.

AB  - This paper examines the land use policies implemented in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, from 1965 to the present. Curitiba used land use planning, the hierarchy of the road network, an economic development policy and public transport to coordinate the parameters for the location and density of homes, work, recreation, services and commerce. The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working. Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management. The paper describes the integration of land use/transportation policies and the instruments that contributed to its enforcement and attempts to draw selected lessons from the experience.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.

Oregon, in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies owing to its early-adopted and widely recognized statewide approach to farm and forest land protection and recent experiment with relaxation of that approach in 2004 with the passage of ballot Measure 37. In this paper we review research-based evidence regarding the forest and farm land conservation effects of Oregon land use planning. We document the evolution of methods used in evaluating state land use planning program performance, including trend analysis, indicator analysis, empirical models, and analysis of indirect effects on the economic viability of forestry and farming. We also draw on data documenting Measure 37 claims to consider the degree to which Measure 37 might have altered land use and development trends had its impacts not been tempered by a subsequent ballot measure - Measure 49. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge and suggest opportunities for future research. Common to nearly all of the studies we reviewed was an acknowledgement of the difficulty in establishing causal relationships between land use planning and land use change given the many exogenous and endogenous factors involved. Despite these difficulties, we conclude that sufficient evidence does exist to suggest that Oregon's land use planning program is contributing a measurable degree of protection to forest and farm land in the state. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growth of black holes and the formation and evolution of galaxies appear to be linked at such a fundamental level that we think of the two as `co-evolving.' Recent observations show that this co-evolution may be complex and the result of several different pathways. While it is clear that black hole accretion is linked to specific phases of the evolution of the host galaxy, the impact of the energy liberated by the black hole on the evolutionary trajectory of the host by feedback is less clear. In this contribution, I review the motivations for co-evolution, the current state of the observational picture, and some challenges by black hole feedback.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore theoretically the qualitative impacts of the planning and development processes on the spatial dynamic interactions between land use and transportation. Specifically, an idealized abstract example of the interactions between two homogeneous regions was studied with respect to various issues related to land use and transportation planning. The study took the form of systems of simple differential equations. Each equation represents the rate of change of either the land use or the transportation condition of a region. Investigation with the two-region model suggested a possibility of spatial and temporal fluctuations under certain planning conditions. By examining the conditions underlying the model equations, planning and developmental practices that may cause system instabilities were identified and discussed.

AB  - With these guidelines,we start an attempt to develop a meaningful understanding, to give guidance and to establish standards in planning land use.In the process of doing so, a certain amount of leeway shall be maintained in order to take regional and local peculiarities into consideration when using the land use planning approach.The concept of LUP considers regional and local conditions in order to meet their peculiarities in an optimal way. Consequently, Land Use Planning: Methods, Strategies and Tools are rather guidelines than a classic manual offering a blueprint. It brings together important ideas and experiences which should be adapted and applied to the specific working conditions in a project. The application for these guidelines is exclusively targeted at rural regions.Urban centres are therefore not included. The content is divided into seven chapters,which are assigned to three different subjects. Chapters 1 and 2 define the policy and planning framework of the GTZ- concept to land use planning.Chapter 3 introduces the components for the organisation of an implementation- orientated planning process. Chapters 4 to 7 discuss, some important aspects of implementation and of land use planning in greater detail. Additional questions arising in the various chapters are dealt with in the eight appendices.

AB  - This research addresses land use and land cover change and the policies that relate to that change in a Midwestern (USA) watershed. Changes in land use/cover over 20 years were studied, with a primary focus on changing forest cover and its distribution. The hypothesis at the outset was that as urbanized area increased and agricultural area decreased, forested areas would decline. Local land use policies were studied for their impact on changing forest cover. Analyses of land use/cover in the watershed show a significant increase in forest cover, simultaneous with decreased agriculture and increased urban use. However, local land use planning measures for protecting forest and open space land were found to be negligible throughout the watershed. Land use planning at the watershed level is analyzed and a stronger authority at this level is recommended. © 1995.

AB  - Most changes in land use affect the amount of carbon held in vegetation and soil, thereby, either releasing carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) to, or removing it from, the atmosphere. The greatest fluxes of carbon result from conversion of forests to open lands (and vice versa). Model-based estimates of the flux of carbon attributable to land-use change are highly variable, however, largely as a result of uncertainties in the areas annually affected by different types of land-use change. Uncertain rates of tropical deforestation, for example, account for more than half of the range in estimates of the global carbon flux. Three other factors account for much of the rest of the uncertainty: (1) the initial stocks of carbon in ecosystems affected by land-use change (i.e., spatial heterogeneity), (2) per hectare changes in carbon stocks in response to different types of land-use change, and (3) legacy effects; that is, the time it takes for carbon stocks to equilibrate following a change in land use. For the tropics, recent satellite-based estimates of deforestation are lower than previous estimates and yield calculated carbon emissions from land-use change that are similar to independently-derived estimates of the total net flux for the region. The similarity suggests that changes in land use account for the net flux of carbon from the tropics. For the northern mid-latitudes, the carbon sink attributed to land-use change is less than the sink obtained by other methods, suggesting either an incomplete accounting of land-use change or the importance of other factors in explaining the current carbon sink in that region.

AB  - Asia’s densely populated agricultural landscapes are undergoing unprecedented eco- logical changes caused by population growth and adoption of industrial technolo- gies such as fossil fuel and chemical fertilizer. Covering nearly 6 × 106 km2, these landscapes now release more than half of global greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural land and biomass fuel. Measuring ecological processes and their changes in these highly heterogeneous “village landscapes” is made difficult by their very small scale of management, with households typically managing many small plots using a wide variety of inputs and methods. This chapter describes the global extent of village landscapes, characterizes their spatial heterogeneity, establishes appropriate scales for ecological change measurement, and demonstrates methods developed to measure long-term ecological changes across village landscapes in China. Reli- able measurements of ecological change in village landscapes can be made by inte- grating high-resolution (≤1 m) landscape change measurements with household-level resource management data. These methods link local land use practices with regional and local ecological change, potentially aiding land use decision-making, but require far greater research effort than conventional land use measurements based on 30–1000 m resolution imagery and county or provincial data. Therefore, a multi-scale sampling and analysis system was developed to integrate local and regional data for estimating regional change across village landscapes in China. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach in measuring and mediating the impacts of ecological changes in densely populated landscapes are discussed in light of preliminary results indicating that population increase and modernization are increasing carbon seques- tration across these landscapes.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - For understanding the causes and effects of changes in land use it is\ncritical to study the interaction between the temporal dynamics and the\nspatial pattern of land use. Interactions arise from feedbacks in the\nhuman-environment system, heterogeneity in the biophysical and human\nenvironment and the influence of land-use history. Land-use simulation\nmodels can serve as a tool to understand these dynamics in more detail\nand assess the impact on ecosystem functioning. This chapter presents a\nspatially explicit modelling approach to explore the spatial and\ntemporal changes in landuse patterns as a function of the specific\ncharacteristics of cropping systems and feedbacks between land use and\nthe environment. A case study for Bac Kan province in northern Vietnam\nis used to test and illustrate the capacity of the model.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover change affect the biogeochemistry of stream ecosys- tems in numerous ways, both direct and indirect. Changes result from hydrologic mod- ifications, including direct alterations of flow regimes and hydrologic flowpaths and indirect changes in hydrologic patterns via increased impervious cover in con- tributing areas of watersheds. Direct changes to channel morphology (i.e., reduced complexity) and to floodplains of streams and rivers also influence biogeochemistry, for example, by eliminating surface watergroundwater exchange. The nature of and strength of connections between the stream and its watershed may be altered by large-scale changes such as those brought about by urban and suburban development. Finally, in urban and agricultural areas, elevated nutrient loading is exacerbated by land-cover changes that increase the potential for erosion or overland flow, and decrease the opportunities for nutrient retention. Using comparative analysis based on published work, mined public data, and new research, we evaluate urbanization effects on stream ecosystems in the Sonoran Desert region of central Arizona. Five key characteristics of non-urban desert streamsnitrogen limitation, a flashy hydro- logic regime that initiates succession, extensive groundwatersurface water interaction, episodic terrestrialaquatic interactions, and high capacity for nutrient retention are both dramatically altered and scarcely affected by urbanization. The similarities exhibited by aridland streams and their urban counterparts arise from large-scale con- straints (e.g., episodic terrestrialaquatic interaction is imposed by the climatic regime in both stream types), whereas the differences, like interrupted flowpath continuity in the urban landscape, likely result from the myriad direct modifica- tions of streams and catchment land cover in cities.

AB  - Due to additional trip production by land use development, the O-D travel costs between some O-D pairs may also change intuitively. This leads to positive and negative impacts on network users traveling between different O-D pairs. Therefore the equity issue about the benefit distribution gained from the land-use development problem is raised. This paper proposes an Equity based Land-Use Transportation Problem (ELUTP) which is intended to examine the benefit distribution among the network users and the resulting equity associated with land-use development problem in terms of the change of equilibrium O-D travel cost. In the resulting bi-level programming model, the upper level sub-problem maximizes traffic production incorporating equity constraints, while the lower level sub-problem is a combined trip distribution/assignment user equilibrium problem. Genetic algorithm based method is applied to test the models using an example network.

AB  - This paper summarizes land-cover and land-use change at eight sites in Thailand, Yunnan (China), Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos over the last 50 years. Project methodology included incorporating information collected from a combination of semiformal, key informant, and formal household interviews with the development of spatial data-bases based on aerial photographs, satellite images, topographic maps, and GPS data. Results suggest that land use (e.g. swidden cultivation) and land cover (e.g. secondary vegetation) have remained stable and the minor amount of land-use change that has occurred has been a change from swidden to monocultural cash crops. Results suggest that two forces will increasingly determine land-use systems in this region. First, national land tenure policies-the nationalization of forest lands and efforts to increase control over upland resources by central governments-will provide a push factor making it increasingly difficult for farmers to maintain their traditional swidden land-use practices. Second, market pressures-the commercialization of subsistence resources and the substitution of commercial crops for subsistence crops-will provide a pull factor encouraging farmers to engage in new and different forms of commercial agriculture. These results appear to be robust as they come from eight studies conducted over the last decade. But important questions remain in terms of what research protocols are needed, if any, when linking social science data with remotely sensed data for understanding human-environment interactions

This model is uniquely capable of providing performance measures for total travel, travel delay, mode shares, economic development, wages, economic welfare, economic equity, rents paid by households and firms, energy use in vehicles and buildings, greenhouse gas emissions, vehicular air pollution, loss of agricultural lands, habitat loss, and erosion potential.

AB  - Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) Insurance, or mileage-based insurance, has the potential to be an effective transportation pricing strategy with multiple benefits including reductions in vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, and vehicle emissions. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), in partnership with Progressive County Mutual Insurance Company (Progressive), conducted a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of implementing mileage-based insurance and whether such a program would impact driver behavior. During the first phase of the study, a statistical analysis of available data produced a positive correlation between mileage driven and accident frequency, thus validating the hypothesis that insurance companies can provide financial incentives to customers who drive fewer miles because of an associated reduction in claims costs. A second phase of the pilot program offered financial incentives to volunteer participants who were able to reduce their mileage from a personal baseline condition. Data collected from the participants' vehicle on-board diagnostic system resulted in an average mileage reduction of five percent. Additional spatial analysis concluded that mileage reduction was independent of participant residence suggesting PAYD Insurance would be a viable strategy to minimize negative environmental impacts region-wide. © ASCE.

AB  - The year 2013 is an important anniversary year. Not only is this Journal 30 years old, but an archetypal ‘infrastructure system’, the National Grid, is 80. Here we have a system that not only resembles a system with physical analogues of nodes and links, but also one that very much behaves like a system. In some respects it is closer to an organism than it is to a machine. It tells a fascinating and timely story about evolution and co-evolution, about complexity and emergence, and about how users and technology have become woven into a single entity. It also allows us to try systems concepts developed in other disciplines for size and to contemplate the future role of civil engineering. Systems thinking will mean that society will be looking for small, clever, user-centred interventions which yield disproportionately beneficial effects as much as ‘grand gestures’ that sometimes fail to meet them. The Grid is an 80-year-old civil and electrical engineering exemplar whose systemic success is taken for granted.

AB  - Based on the theories of the information entropy of urban land use structure, co-integration and error correction model, this thesis analyses the relationship between economic growth, urbanization level and the information entropy of urban land use structure. The information entropy values of China's urban land use structure from 1981 to 2004 have been calculated in this paper. The relationship between China's GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is investigated in details. The results indicate a co-integration relationship between GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure. However, there is no co-integration relationship between urbanization and the information entropy of urban land use structure. On the basis of the above analyses, the error correction model on GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is instituted. The application of the model shows that every 1% decrease in the information entropy value of urban land use structure demands a 59.53% growth in GDP. Because of the existing co-integration relationship between the economic growth and the information entropy of urban land use structure, the order degree of China's urban land use structure has relied heavily on the economic growth for a long time. The economic growth will significantly affect the optimal regulation of urban land use structure in the future. Further investigation also shows that economic growth and urbanization act as the direct driving force of the optimization of urban land use structure, but the optimization of urban land use structure can't promote the economic growth and the urbanization. Therefore, it becomes a very pressing strategic issue to adjust the economic structure and industrial distribution to optimize the distribution of urban land use and to optimize the structure of urban land use to improve the efficiency and promote the socio-economic development.

AB  - The last two decades have witnessed the implementation of various policies based on land-use to address problems stemming from automobile ownership and use. There are, however, questions with respect to the efficacy of such policies. This paper therefore reviews the literature on empirical studies of the transportation-land-use interaction with the objective of identifying the current state of knowledge concerning the interactions, particularly with respect to the impact land-use policies are likely to have on the system. The focus is on studies conducted in North America. The results are mixed; some studies conclude that urban densities, traditional neighborhood design schemes, and land-use mix have an impact on auto ownership and use. Other studies find the impact of such variables to be at best marginal. Gaps in our understanding of the interaction are identified. These are found to be primarily the result of data limitations and methodological weaknesses. A detailed discussion of the implications of the findings for the development and application of integrated transportation-land-use models is provided, with the recommendation that without such an integrated approach to analyzing the transportation-land-use interaction, any study of impacts of urban form on travel behavior is likely to yield erroneous results.

This paper introduces the Sequenced Activity-Mobility Simulator (SAMS), a dynamic and integrated microsimulation forecasting system for transportation, land use and air quality, designed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional four-step travel demand forecasting systems. The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected exter- nally to be input into the forecasting process.

AB  - This research examines how representational gestures (Kita 2000), made by scientists during collaborative discussion in a biochemistry lab, are used in formulating scientific theory. By analyzing digital video of lab meetings and interviews, we find that representational gestures are frequently used to reference, modify, and embody portions of existing material structure such as models, diagrams, and graphs. Representational gestures appear to play a significant role in how scientists both conceptualize and communicate theories. We believe that representational gestures operate as instantiations of essential spatio-dynamic features that are not efficiently conveyed in other modalities, like language and graphical representations, and, as such, are essential resources for shaping theoretical understandings when used in collaborative, face-to-face activity. Gestures may also serve to align cognitive processes in a “community of practice” (Lave 1991) and can package theoretical conjectures into a single semiotic form that can be used symbolically to evoke a rich, shared conceptual history. We use a theoretical framework provided by distributed cognition and embodied cognition to examine jointly shared representational gestures as cognitive artifacts produced and modified by the biochemistry lab community during the practice of theory construction.

AB  - The water cycle is a vital component of the North Eurasian environment and plays a central role in the region's climate, biology, biogeochemistry and in human interactions with the natural environment. The Northern Eurasian arctic drainage covers more than 2/3 of the pan-arctic land mass. Substantial changes in land cover and land use have occurred over the region in recent decades, as a result of changes in climate, permafrost, and water management, among other factors. These changes are likely to affect large-scale linkages between the regional and global climate system, but the nature of these interactions is not well understood. In this chapter, we analyze changes in the dominant hydrological components and explore the interaction of the terrestrial and atmospheric water cycles, with particular attention to key regional cryospheric processes and linkages between the water and carbon cycles. The monitoring of the water cycle from observational networks and remote sensing along with strategies for improving hydrological change detection are discussed in the context of changes in land cover and land use.

AB  - Soils contain more than twice the amount of carbon found in the atmosphere. Historically, soils have lost 40–90 Pg C globally through cultivation and disturbance. Current rates of carbon loss due to land-use change are about 1.6 ± 0.8 Pg C y−1, mainly in the tropics. The most effective mechanism for soil carbon management would be to halt land-use conversion, but with a growing population in the developing world, and changing diets, more land is likely to be required for agriculture. Maximizing the productivity of existing agricultural land and applying best management practices to that land would slow the loss of, or is some cases restore, soil carbon. However, there are many barriers to implementing best management practices, the most significant of which in developing countries are driven by poverty and in some areas exacerbated by a growing population. Management practices that also improve food security and profitability are most likely to be adopted. Soil carbon management needs to be considered within a broader framework of sustainable development. Policies to encourage fair trade, reduced subsidies for agriculture in developed countries, and less onerous interest on loans and foreign debt would encourage sustainable development, which in turn would encourage the adoption of successful soil carbon management in developing countries.

AB  - This paper examines the land use policies implemented in the city of Curitiba, Brazil, from 1965 to the present, Curitiba used land use planning, the hierarchy of the road network, an economic development policy and public transport to coordinate the parameters for the location and density of homes, work, recreation, services and commerce. The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working, Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management. The paper describes the integration of land use/transportation policies and the instruments that contributed to its enforcement and attempts to draw selected lessons from the experience.

AB  - The book presents recent estimates of the rates in changes of major land classes such as forest, cropland and pasture. Among the causative mechanisms behind land change, synergetic factor combinations are found to be more common than single key factor explanations. Aggregated globally, multiple impacts of local land changes are shown to significantly affect central aspects of Earth System functioning. Innovative developments and applications in the fields of modeling and scenario construction are presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn about the most pressing implications for the design of appropriate intervention policies, and on new directions and frontiers of research. The edited book synthesizes research achievements by dozens of scientists related to the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change (IHDP). It summarizes relevant findings on global land-use change which arose from value-adding activities of the LUCC project, starting in 1995 and extending until its termination in October 2005. The main intention is to describe how human modification of land cover became a major driving force of Earth System changes over the past 300 years, a period of most rapid transformations, with fundamental implications for current landscape configurations. In writing this book, current knowledge and understanding is reported on the rates, causes/pathways, impacts, future scenarios/models, policy implications and new research directions in the field of land-use/cover change.

AB  - One way to cope with the increasing demand in transporta- tion networks is to integrate standard solutions with more intelligent measures. This paper discusses the effects of inte- grating co-evolving decision-making regarding route choices (by drivers) and control measures (by traffic lights) We use microscopic modeling and simulation, in opposition to the classical network analysis. General questions here are whether co-evolution pays off, and, if so, what kind of evolutionary approach shall be used. This is challenging for networks other than the two-route one due to the complexity of route- choice behavior, as well as control strategies by the traffic lights. Moreover, the more agents, the less effective learn- ing strategies are, especially when the integration among them depicts complex interelationships. The approach was tested in different scenarios using centralized and decentral- ized methods.

While remote sensing, both from satellites and air photos, provides a central resource for study, socio-economic surveys, censuses, and map sources also supply a wealth of valid information. Land Use Change: Science, Policy, and Management presents spatial theories and methodologies that support an integrated approach to the analysis of land use change. Focusing on spatial representation and modeling, this book addresses such important scientific issues as the dynamics of change, integration and feedback between system elements, and scale issues in space and time.

AB  - This paper describes a series of tests carried out with a comprehensive transportation, land use and air quality simulation system, which has been designed for planning application at the metropolitan or regional scale, within the framework of the U.S. Government's Clean Air legislation. The urban location portion of the system was developed at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of S. H. Putman. The air quality sections incorporate models formulated in earlier studies. The system was tested with data from the San Francisco Bay area, for the period 1975–1980. The test policies included changes in regional transportation costs and population totals; local interventions in the transportation network; and controls on pollutant emissions from mobile and stationary sources. To assess net impacts, the outcomes predicted for each policy were compared with the outcomes predicted in a “benchmark”, or base run of the system. The tests showed that the system is sensitive to a broad range of air quality policies, and that it is capable of predicting important air quality consequences of transportation and land use policies. Some further development will be needed before the system can be used in practical planning situations, but there is little doubt as to the soundness of its central theoretical constructs and logical structure.

AB  - In Virginia, off-network, or local network, VMT calculations are performed based on counts taken as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) program. A regional average VMT is calculated based on counts taken at a number of region-wide locations, This VMT average is then applied to overall local road lengths to calculate the local network VMT. This calculation method has been approved by the EPA for use in Air Quality Conformity analysis. The off-network VMT calculated with this method was found to be 22 percent of total VMT for the Hampton Roads non-conforming region. Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis tools were used to identify issues that would cause an inflated off-network calculation. Analysis included determining whether the data derived from these count sites represented regional average travel. The methods employed included an identification of regional land use averages, a determination of whether network roads were double counted, and analysis of whether count site locations were representative of average, local road characteristics, The issues identified by this analysis resulted in a recalculation of off-network VMT using a smaller portion of the previously used HPMS count data which more accurately represented regional averages. This recalculation resulted in a 45 percent reduction in the off-network VMT,value used for air conformity. The paper outlines some of the drawbacks of using HPMS data to derive off-network VMT values and identifies a number of issues that may be inflating these values in other areas of the country.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

This study integrates remote sensing data with social surveys to identify the role of demographic, technology and market-related variables in cropland expansion during economic reforms in Ghana. Macroeconomic changes increased the commercial orientation of farming as the sources of food supply changed from import to domestic production. However interest rates liberalization increased the use of labor at the expense of fertilizer and other complementary inputs. Demographic variables were more important in explaining cropland change after structural adjustment. Public agricultural support services are required for sustainable market-induced agricultural change in Ghana.

AB  - Although there are only a limited number of rigorous research papers focussed specifically on land use perceptions, there is an extensive literature on: environmental attitudes in general and urban growth in particular, as well as on the land use perceptions of farmers and on public perceptions about the use of land for the production of food and raw materials. A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact. So the paper concludes with a discussion about future perceptions and possible behavioural change. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This article examines the changes that occurred in the rail network and density of population in London during the 19th and 20th centuries. It aims to disentangle the ‘chicken and egg’ problem of which came first, network or land development, through a set of statistical analyses clearly distinguishing events by order. Using panel data representing the 33 boroughs of London over each decade from 1871 to 2001, the research finds that there is a positive feedback effect between population density and network density. Additional rail stations (either Underground or surface) are positive factors leading to subsequent increases in population in the suburbs of London, while additional population density is a factor in subsequently deploying more rail. These effects differ in central London, where the additional accessibility produced by rail led to commercial development and concomitant depopulation. There are also differences in the effects associated with surface rail stations and Underground stations, as the Underground was able to get into central London in a way that surface rail could not. However, the two networks were weak (and statistically insignificant) substitutes for each other in the suburbs, while the density of surface rail stations was a complement to the Underground in the center, though not vice versa.

AB  - Anthropogenic land use changes drive a range of infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events and modify the transmission of endemic infections. These drivers include agricultural encroachment, deforestation, road construction, dam building, irrigation, wetland modification, mining, the concentration or expansion of urban environments, coastal zone degradation, and other activities. These changes in turn cause a cascade of factors that exacerbate infectious disease emergence, such as forest fragmentation, disease introduction, pollution, poverty, and human migration. The Working Group on Land Use Change and Disease Emergence grew out of a special colloquium that convened international experts in infectious diseases, ecology, and environmental health to assess the current state of knowledge and to develop recommendations for addressing these environmental health challenges. The group established a systems model approach and priority lists of infectious diseases affected by ecologic degradation. Policy relevant levels of the model include specific health risk factors, landscape or habitat change, and institutional (economic and behavioral) levels. The group recommended creating Centers of ExceHence in Ecology and Health Research and Training, based at regional universities and/or research institutes with close links to the surrounding communities. The centers' objectives would be 3-fold: a) to provide information to local communities about the links between environmental change and public health; b) to facilitate fully interdisciplinary research from a variety of natural, social, and health sciences and train professionals who can conduct interdisciplinary research; and c) to engage in science-based communication and assessment for policy making toward sustainable health and ecosystems.

AB  - Marginal land provides an alternative potential for food and bioenergy production in the face of limited land resources; however, effective assessment of marginal lands is not well addressed. Concerns over environmental risks, ecosystem services and sustainability for marginal land have been widely raised. The objective of this study was to develop a hierarchical marginal land assessment framework for land use planning and management. We first identified major land functions linking production, environment, ecosystem services and economics, and then classified land resources into four categories of marginal land using suitability and limitations associated with major management goals, including physically marginal land, biologically marginal land, environmentally ecologically marginal land, and economically marginal land. We tested this assessment framework in southwestern Michigan, USA. Our results indicated that this marginal land assessment framework can be potentially feasible on land use planning for food and bioenergy production, and balancing multiple goals of land use management. We also compared our results with marginal land assessment from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and land capability classes (LCC) that are used in the US. The hierarchical assessment framework has advantages of quantitatively reflecting land functions and multiple concerns. This provides a foundation upon which focused studies can be identified in order to improve the assessment framework by quantifying high-resolution land functions associated with environment and ecosystem services as well as their criteria needed to improve the assessment framework. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using socio-economic data and multilevel regression, we show how modernisation of farming systems and commercialisation of crop production reach villages to various degrees. Most changes in the rural sector are directed towards cash cropping and accentuate socio-economic disparities between households. Most land use changes are linked to social networks but different changes imply different degrees of involvement in agriculture.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the indirect land use change (ILUC) effects of ethanol production expansion in Brazil through the use of an inter-regional, bottom-up, dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated with the 2005 Brazilian I-O table. A new methodology to deal with ILUC effects is developed, using a transition matrix of land uses calibrated with Agricultural Censuses data. Agriculture and land use are modeled separately in each of 15 Brazilian regions with different agricultural mix. This regional detail captures a good deal of the differences in soil, climate and history that cause particular land to be used for particular purposes.Brazilian land area data distinguish three broad types of agricultural land use, Crop, Pasture, and Plantation Forestry. Between one year and the next the model allows land to move between those categories, or for unused land to convert to one of these three, driven initially by the transition matrix, changing land supply for agriculture between years. The transition matrix shows Markov probabilities that a particular hectare of land used in one year for some use would be in another use next period. These probabilities are modified endogenously in the model according to the average unit rentals of each land type in each region.We ask whether biofuel expansion is consistent with new laws, limiting forest clearing in Brazil. A simulation with ethanol expansion scenario is performed for year 2020, in which land supply is allowed to increase only in states located on the agricultural frontier. Results suggest that each new hectare of sugar cane requires only 0.14. ha of new land, with another 0.47. ha converted from pasture use. Hence policies limiting deforestation are unlikely to prevent greater ethanol production. Finally, regional differences in sugarcane productivity are found to be important elements in ILUC effects of sugar cane expansion. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This is an analysis of the relationships between changes in land use, land cover and socio-economic metabolism in Austria between 1950 and 1995, covering the period during which Austria's agriculture was industrialized. From 1950 to about 1980, Austria mainly strove to achieve self-sufficiency as an agricultural producer. This goal was met in the 1970s, largely through agricultural intensification. Since then, the primary focus of Austrian agricultural policy has been to reduce agricultural overproduction, to preserve the existing farm structure, as well as to keep as large an agricultural area under cultivation as is possible. As a consequence, since the 1980s yields rose slowly and subsidized fallow covered substantial parts of cropland area. Austria joined the European Union in 1995, after which agricultural policy was, to a large extent, determined by the EU Common Agricultural Policy. From 1950 to 1995 we observe a continuous trend of declining cropland and grassland areas, increases in the areas of built-up and infrastructure land, and a slow increase in forested areas. The segregation of cropland cultivation and livestock husbandry leads to a concentration of cropland in fertile lowlands and of grasslands in the lower alpine regions from which crops are retreating. As a result of livestock being fed increasing amounts of cropland produce and imported protein feedstuffs, there was a disintegration of local nutrient cycles and a rising input of mineral fertilizer. We interpret these changes as a consequence of the massive input of fossil energy into Austria's agricultural system, which allowed a surge in the intensification of transport. We analyze these trends using GIS maps based upon statistic data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Land use and transportation are linked by complex, yet identifiable, relationships. Tools are needed to formalize this relationship and to take it into account when decisions are made about urban and suburban transportation systems. This paper reviews foundational concepts of performance measures of metropolitan transportation systems. It offers a rationale for the types of tools needed to measure and assess land use and transportation system efficiency. One tool being developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation-the Transportation-Efficient Land Use Mapping Index (TELUMI)-illustrates how research findings can be applied in metropolitan transportation planning. TELUMI uses cartographic modeling (CM) techniques and parcel-level geographic information system data. The fine resolution of the data measures microscaled land use conditions associated with travel patterns in built-up areas. CM generates maps of zones in a region that match land use conditions with travel behaviors. Zones are defined by land use variables, such as density of activities, presence and agglomeration of destinations, block size, and transportation infrastructure attributes. CM also performs advanced quantitative analyses of map attributes, and it is effective with lay and professional audiences. TELUMI's use of individual land use variables makes it possible to target intervention strategies, such as augmenting density or building sidewalks, and to evaluate their effectiveness in improving transportation efficiency. TELUMI assists transportation and local planning authorities in allocating transportation investments appropriate to multimodal travel.

It focuses on bilateral and multilateral development agencies. Since the first compilation exercise was carried out in 2001, the ICT for development landscape has changed in a number of ways that are well reflected in the survey findings, including: * most donors have now developed a strategy not only to use ICT for development within their existing and new programmes but also to integrate ICT within their own agencies to improve the way they deliver their development programmes * strategies are shaped by long-term experience in the field of ICT for development, pilot projects or by in-depth studies. They are guided by the needs of developing countries, particularly the priorities identified in the Millennium Declaration * ICTs are considered in the broad sense, encompassing both traditional, old technologies (radio, television) and high technologies (Internet, mobile phones) and some donors emphasise the interest of combining both new and old technologies to maximise benefits * ICTs are in most cases seen as tools to help meet development objectives and not as a separate sector. Some donors also underline the need to create an enabling environment as a prerequisite for effective and efficient use of ICTs as tools for development. For those donors, investment in telecommunications infrastructure and the creation of the necessary technological, legal, regulatory and human framework remains a priority * in all cases, donors put ICT to the service of the achievement of their broader strategic objectives. The focus is on meeting objectives not on technology per se * donors’ guiding principles for use of ICT for development emphasise respect for national ownership and that support should be demand-driven, encouraging and assisting developing country governments to formulate their own ICT development strategies. When developing countries decide to harness ICT for development, some donors recommend that those developing country governments include their ICT for development strategy in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) * most donors have built their ICT for development strategy on partnerships involving a number of actors from other bilateral and multilateral agencies, ministries (communications, education…), civil society, the private sector, universities and research institutions The difficulty in identifying or quantifying the ICT component of projects might be the clearest demonstration that most donors have indeed mainstreamed ICT in their development programmes. However, it is estimated that: * there has not been a significant increase in funding for ICT since 2001 * that the amount directly for ICT, including to the telecommunications sector, remains well short of $1 billion

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - During the last decades Mediterranean systems are being affected by important land use changes which are transforming the entire landscape. Traditional irrigated lands have constituted one of the most characteristic agro-landscapes in the Mediterranean and have played a relevant socio-economic, ecological and environmental role. However, these valuable agro-landscapes are progressively decaying due to recent socio-economic changes which, at the same time, are promoting new irrigated lands outside the river valleys. These new irrigated lands have a major effect on land, water resources, landscape and the biodiversity value of extensive tracts of the Mediterranean area. At the same time, Mediterranean drylands are quickly disappearing due to land abandonment. In addition, Mediterranean areas are suffering a quick urbanisation process affecting both natural and agricultural areas. These trends may be considered as a reduction of the most characteristically rural Mediterranean landscape to favour ecologically extreme landscapes: on one side the natural areas and on the other side the new irrigated lands and urban areas. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the factors driving the land use changes in the Mediterranean, to analyse their ecological effects and to explore the potential implications of several policies regarding land use and natural resources. To this aim, we have analysed the land use changes and their socio-economic and environmental context in three study cases in Southeastern Spain, an arid Mediterranean area where the four above-mentioned land use changes are taking place. These study cases are the traditional irrigated land of Murcia, the agricultural system of Mazarron-Aguilas and the land use changes in the Mar Menor watershed. The ancient Murcia irrigated lands constitutes a paradigmatic example of the loss of this valuable agro-landscape and its highly fertile soils due to the urbanisation process and spread of infrastructures. The Mazarron-Aguilas new irrigated lands may be considered as representative of the most intensive agricultural systems in the Mediterranean area, which are quickly spreading at the expense of drylands and natural areas. The Mar Menor watershed have suffered important agricultural and urban-tourist land use changes affecting the hydrological and nutrient dynamics and the biological communities of the coastal lagoon and associated wetlands. An integrated approach has been applied combining GIS, Remote Sensing, spatial and environmental modelling and dynamic system models to analyse the sustainability of these three case studies, the spatial and temporal patterns of land use, the main socio-economic and environmental driving factors and their ecological implications.

AB  - An empirical assessment of the interaction between the land use—transportation system and travel behavior is presented. A methodology for identifying a range of land use—transportation systems by a clustering technique with network and land use inputs was developed. Twenty neighborhoods from Orange County, California, were considered in this process. Three groups, or themes, were found to best represent the neighborhoods in the sample area: one each associated with the conventional definition of traditional and neotraditional neighborhood design (TND) and planned unit development (PUD) neighborhoods and one representing neighborhoods that blend characteristics of TND and PUD. Conventional measures of individual travel behavior were compared with an analysis of variance between the themes to identify significant differences, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Research results include the development of (a) a systematic methodology to identify a more explicit land use—transportation dimension, (b) an estimate of the potential effectiveness of design-oriented solutions to reduce automobile congestion by using the developed themes, and (c) a preliminary assessment of the extent to which development themes can be used to improve the current modeling framework.

AB  - Land use and land cover are important determinants of the state of the natural environment. As a result, measures of land use and land cover change have been widely used as indicators of environmental condition and quality. This review explores the range of measures that have been applied in the UK at national, regional and local scales, and their sensitivity to particular drivers of change. The extent to which these indicators are important properties in themselves or are surrogates for wider environmental qualities is considered. The discussion focuses on the evolving frameworks used to analyse the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment. The limitations and strengths of the DPSIR reporting and analytical framework are explored. Recent approaches to the assessment of the impacts of future land use change on the natural environment using model-based scenario methods are examined, and the need to develop new types of aggregate measure of land use function is identified. There is also a pressing need to link assessments of trends to the analysis of sustainability thresholds or limits. It is concluded that the concept of a socio-ecological system offers a more fruitful approach to the analysis of the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment than the simplistic cause-effect models that have been used in the past. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - To address climate change, many U.S. states are taking action to establish policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all economic sectors. With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided. The information in this paper provides a starting-point for transportation practitioners to use when initiating their own evaluations of greenhouse gas mitigation options at the regional, state, or local level.

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - This themed issue of Land Use Policy builds mainly on papers presented at an international conference on 'Land Use Issues and Policy in China under Rapid Rural and Urban Transformation', convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, in October 2012. The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings from a range of disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems due to the nature of the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of this, this themed edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditional empirical land use change models generally assume one average land use decision-maker. Multi-Agent System (MAS) models, on the other hand, acknowledge existence of different types of agents, but their poor empirical embedding remains a serious handicap. This paper demonstrates how agent information can also be incorporated into empirical, biophysical land use models. Agent (farmer) information was captured in four farmer types by means of cluster analysis. The types were distinguished by age, education, property size, distance from residence, and the number of animals owned. This information was made spatially explicit as each field in the study area is related to a farmer, based on cadastral information. Statistical interaction terms between farmer type and landscape factors such as remoteness, soil quality, slope and aspect, were tested for significance in describing the observed occurrence of three land use changes: afforestation of arable land, abandonment of arable land, and restoration of the traditional Montado system. Results showed that each farmer type uses different criteria for selecting land for a certain land use change. For example, absentee farmers abandon the most remote areas while other farmer types do not use remoteness as a criterion for abandonment; active farmers select the most accessible fields for afforestation while other farmer types do not; absentee farmers select their best soils for restoration of the traditional Montado system, while active farmers tend to select poor soils. It is demonstrated that each farmer type shows a different relationship between landscape factors and land use changes. Hence, farmer-specific relationships between landscape and land use contribute significantly to the explanation of land use change. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this research was to identify the factors responsible for residential and industrial/commercial land development in Lagos between 1984 and 2000. Land use changes were mapped using satellite images, while binary logistic regression was used to model the probability of observing urban development as a function of spatially explicit independent variables. Accessibility, spatial interaction effects and policy variables were the major determinants of land use change. Variables that influenced residential development were not necessarily those responsible for the expansion of industrial/commercial land area.s. The evidence of frontier residential development calls for land tenure and housing development reforms, and land use controls to minimize the environmental consequences of unplanned urban expansion.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - Rural land-use in the European Union (EU) is strongly influenced by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) because it directly affects the relative profitability of different land-use options. Since 2000, the CAP has been heavily reformed. In particular, in Sweden, the 2003 CAP reform was followed by substantial shifts in agricultural land allocation. However, this land-use change has barely been studied empirically beyond the net changes of land-use categories. In order to better understand the transformation of the land-use system, all transitions between land-use categories and changes within existing categories need to be considered. This article presents an analysis of agricultural land-use change between 2002 and 2010 in a landscape in southern Sweden. The inter-category land transitions were identified and quantified by using a spatially explicit field-level resolution dataset. The intra-category change of utilization intensity was assessed for grasslands by using standard yields and forage consumption estimates. Substantial shifts in chains of connected inter-category land transitions were found between cereals, temporary grasses, permanent pastures and fallow lands. The grassland utilization analysis showed a growing gap between grassland area and forage consumption. These results indicate concentration of agricultural production to better quality land and a growing number of land-idling farms in the region. The CAP single farm payment scheme is discussed in the light of these findings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land-use change has been associated with changes in the dynamics of infectious disease in West Africa. Here we describe the complex interactions of land-use change with three diseases (both vector- and non-vector-bome) of considerable public health significance in this region, namely, malaria and irrigation; epidemic meningitis and land degradation; onchocerciasis and deforestation. We highlight the confounding effect of climate variability, which acts as a driver of both land-use change and human health. We conclude, as have others, that the scale of observation always matters, and complex and dynamic feedbacks among social-ecological systems are not easily teased apart. We suggest that in order to establish the causal chain of interactions between land-use change and human health outcomes two approaches are necessary. The first is to have a thorough understanding of the aetiology of disease and the specific mechanisms by which land-use and climate variability affect the transmission of pathogens. This is achieved by focused, detailed studies encompassing a wide range of potential drivers, which are inevitably small scale and often cover short time periods. The second consists of large-scale studies of statistical associations between transmission indices or health outcomes and environmental variables stratified by known ecological or socio-economic confounders, and sufficient in size to overcome local biases in results. Such research activities need to be designed to inform each other if we are to develop predictive models for monitoring these diseases and to develop integrated programs for human health and sustainable land use.

AB  - Green Belt policies have helped to create chaotic landscapes at the rural-urban interfaces of the United Kingdom's largest cities. Their prime functions, to control urban sprawl and preserve an encircling green girdle to separate the urban from the open countryside, have created 'edgelands' that have been remarkably dynamic despite relatively strong controls on certain types of development. A detailed case study of one part of London's Metropolitan Green Belt, drawing upon analysis of planning registers, reveals long-term trends in land-use change linked to the development controls operated within the context of the Green Belt and the adjacent built-up area. This paper also outlines the history of the Green Belt policy in the United Kingdom (UK) and discusses recently proposed policy changes that have provoked ongoing debate about this form of control on urban sprawl and its consequences for the land use of Green Belts and the edgelands. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In conservation areas, land use conﬂicts frequently occur due to the increasing number of land resource managers and users who usually have different interests, objectives and perceptions. Sharing all these apriori legitimate differences is a prerequisite for better collective management of the land. The companion modelling approach is used to build a shared representation of interactions between vegetation dynamics, reforestation efforts and livestock grazing in a forest conservation area of northern Thailand. This article focuses on the participatory modelling process that led to the co-construction of an agent-based model. Sensitizing exercises on vegetation dynamics and an agent-based simulator associated with a role-playing game were the main tools used. The social interactions and decision-making processes observed during the gaming and simulation sessions were used to construct a set of rules implemented in a subsequent autonomous agent-based model. It will be used to simulate future land management scenarios with local stakeholders.

AB  - Land use changes play a key role in sustainable, rural development. In decision-making for land use, sustainability impact assessment is therefore essential and must provide condensed key information about impact pathway relationships based on complex scientific analysis. For this purpose a number of science-based valuation frameworks exist, including ecosystem services as applied in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, landscape functions identified through landscape ecology and land use functions, a multifunctionality-based approach developed in the EU Integrated Project SENSOR (Sustainability Impact Assessment: Tools for environmental, social and economic effects of multifunctional land use in European regions). In this article, the three approaches are comparatively reviewed for their suitability for sustainability impact assessment of land use changes, using the following criteria: premises and perspectives, application in the science-policy interface, spatial and temporal references, consideration of the three sustainability dimensions and the role of land use. Core findings are that ecosystem services were biased towards the environmental dimension of sustainability and best suited for long-term projections. Landscape functions were aligned with the above sustainability concept and met prospective planning purposes. Land use functions were a pragmatic way for stakeholder-driven sustainability assessment of land use changes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional. The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research projects.

AB  - In response to the concerns about the costs of sprawl and to guide growth development of Maryland's future, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Act of 1992 and recently passed the Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Act of 1997. While the first legislation established new visions for growth and development of Maryland's future, the second legislation gives the State programmatic and fiscal tools to assist local governments implementing the Visions. The growth management legislation has very important implications for land use development and transportation system in the Baltimore region. This research simulates the land use-transportation interactions by means of an integrated land use and transportation model, and evaluates economic and environmental impacts of smart growth and alternative policies and their distributional impacts by income groups in the Baltimore metropolitan region. The mode simulates the demand and supply in both land and transportation markets and models explicitly the feedback from the transportation system to the land use system and induced demand associated with transportation improvements. Consumers' surplus is used to evaluate the result and impacts of various policy scenarios on different income groups. This paper reports the mode design and database development for this modeling effort. Recently, the Baltimore Metropolitan Council (BMC) initiated the integrated land use/transportation modeling project. This paper summarizes the progress of this project. It first reviews the forces driving integrated modeling applications and the state of art in urban and regional modeling. Then, it outlines the model design for the Baltimore region. Finally it reports the database development for model calibration and forecasting.

AB  - Several land-based policy options are discussed within the current quest for feasible climate change mitigation options, among them the creation and conservation of forest carbon sinks through mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation also called REDD+ and the substitution of fossil fuels through biofuels, as legislated in the EU Renewable Energy Directive. While those two policy processes face several methodological challenges, there is one issue that both processes encounter: the displacement of land use and the related emissions, which is referred to as carbon leakage in the context of emissions accounting, and indirect land-use change also called ILUC within the bioenergy realm. The debates surrounding carbon leakage and indirect land-use change issues run in parallel but are rather isolated from each other, without much interaction. This paper analyzes the similarities and differences as well as common challenges within these parallel debates by the use of peer-reviewed articles and reports, with a focus on approaches to address and methods to quantify emissions at national and international scale. The aim is to assess the potential to use synergies and learn from the two debates to optimize climate benefits. The results show that the similarities are many, while the differences between carbon leakage and ILUC are found in the actual commodity at stake and to some degree in the policy forum in which the debate is taken. The geographical scale, actors and parties involved also play a role. Both processes operate under the same theoretical assumption and face the same problem of lacking methods to quantify the emissions caused by international displacement. The approach to international displacement is one of the main differences; while US and EU biofuel policymakers acknowledge uncertainties in ILUC accounting but strive to reduce them, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change excludes accounting for international carbon leakage. Potential explanations behind these differences lie in the liability issue and the underlying accounting principles of producer responsibility for carbon leakage and consumer responsibility for ILUC. This is also reflected on the level of lobby activities, where ILUC has reached greater public and policy interest than carbon leakage. Finally, a possible way forward for international leakage accounting in future climate treaties could be the adoption of accounting methods taking a consumer perspective, to be used alongside the existing set-up, which could improve climate integrity of land-based policies. ?? 2013 .

AB  - The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, encompassed by a water- shed extending 168,000 km2 over portions of six states and Washington, D.C. Restoration of the Bay has been the focus of a two-decade regional partnership of local, state and fed- eral agencies, including a network of scientists, politicians and activists interacting through various committees, working groups, and advisory panels. The effectiveness of the restora- tion effort has been mixed, with both notable successes and failures. The overall health of the Bay has not declined since the restoration was initiated in 1983, but many of the advances have been offset by the pressure of increasing population and exurban sprawl across the watershed. The needs of the Chesapeake Bay Program are many, but the greatest is accurate information on land cover and land use change, primarily to assess the implications for water quality, examine various restoration scenarios, and calibrate spatial models of the urbanization process. We report here on a number of new land cover and land use data prod- ucts, and associated applications to assist vulnerability assessment, integrated ecosystem analysis, and ultimately Bay restoration. We provide brief overviews of applications to model new residential development, assess losses and vulnerability of resource lands, and identify the factors that disrupt the health of streams in small watersheds. These data products and approaches are being applied by a number of agencies involved with the restoration effort, including the Chesapeake Bay Program’s activities focused on living resources, water qual- ity, and sound land use.

AB  - A supportive distribution of residential density is perceived to be an essential component of strategies aimed at increasing the use of public transit. To alter substantially land use-transport dynamics in a fashion that favours public transit patronage, residential density policies must be deployed over long periods and unfold at local and metropolitan levels simultaneously. The article narrates policies that attempted, since the late 1950s, a juxtaposition of high residential density and quality public transit services in the Toronto metropolitan region. Findings highlight the difficulties of pursuing such policies due to the power of neighbourhood-based interests, disagreement among jurisdictions within the metropolitan region and changes in priorities and intervention capacity. The article ends with proposals that seek to enhance the possibility of transforming the structure and dynamics of cities in ways that are compatible with smart growth principles.

Biodiversity, a term that has entered into common usage only in the last twenty years, refers to the diversity of life at all levels of organization, from genetic to species to ecosystem (Levin 2000). Although we refer throughout this chapter most commonly to species diversity, land use change alters biodiversity at all of these levels. For example, reduced habitat from land use change decreases population sizes and reduces genetic diversity within a species.

AB  - Based on surveys on rural land-use change at village scale in Yucheng City, Shandong province, this paper presents how land-use change takes place in response to inhibitive institutional forces in light of an outmoded land ownership system and unreasonable land use rights administration, and discusses it in the broader social context of industrialization, rural depopulation, a dual-track land market, and land use legislation. Spatial comparison of land use maps interpreted from aerial photographs in different period unveils a decrease in arable land for farming, and an increase in rural settlements, facilities land and unused land. Despite rural depopulation, rural settlements area nearly tripled during 1967-2008. Nearly all newly gained non-agricultural land originated from farmland at the village fringe while formerly facilities land and unused land had been converted to residential use and it was abandoned later. Thus, the destructive farmland conversion from productive use to non-agricultural uses took place at multiple stages. Questionnaire survey of 1650 households in 48 villages in Yucheng City indicated that 41% of the households had multiple dwellings, even though some of them are not occupied or even ruined. This finding may damp the rosy picture of the reportedly slowdown in China's farmland reduction in recent years as these destructive changes are too small to detect from satellite imagery, and it will also provide a practical scientific basis for constituting more strict farmland protection objectives and strategies for China in the near future. In order to hold back the destructive conversion trend from farmland to non-agricultural uses, the authors argue that policy and institution innovation concerning land use and urban-rural development in China needs feature highly in the government's agenda. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In a previous paper [McCusker, B., Carr, E.R., 2006. The co-production of livelihoods and land use change: Case studies from South Africa and Ghana. Geoforum 37 (5), 790-804], we argued that land use and livelihoods could best be understood as co-produced, where land use and livelihoods are not separate objects of knowledge related to one another through abstract processes, but different manifestations of social processes through which individuals and groups come to understand the challenges facing their everyday lives, the various resources available to them to negotiate these challenges, and the strategies by which they can conduct that negotiation. In this paper, we examine the theoretical basis for "co-production" with the goal of using this approach to inform development interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Humankind is dependent upon Earth's ecological life support system,\nwhose well-being, in turn, depends upon the practices of human society.\nThe health of both systems requires harmonious, mutualistic interactions\nbetween them. Because of its population size and demographic\ndistribution (increasingly urbanized), humankind is also dependent upon\nits technological life support system, which, as currently managed,\nthreatens the ecological life support system. A fundamental difference\nexists between the two systems humankind is capable of using\nintelligence and reason to regulate its activities but the 30+ million\nother life forms that comprise the ecological life support system\ncannot. As a consequence, empathy for the other system is the\nresponsibility of human society. Sustainable co-evolution requires that\nhuman society has a high level of ecological literacy and acts in a\nnurturing, compassionate way toward the other system. Only then will\nsustainable co-evolution be possible since both systems are dynamic and\ncontinually changing.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to simulate the location of land-use change, specifically forest disturbance, in Costa Rica over several decades. This paper presents a GIS-based model, GEOMOD2, which quantifies factors associated with land-use, and simulates the spatial pattern of land-use forward and backward in time. GEOMOD2 reads rasterized maps of land-use and other biogeophysical attributes to determine empirically the attributes of land that humans tend to use. Then GEOMOD2 uses the patterns of those biogeophysical attributes to simulate the spatial pattern of land-use change. GEOMOD2 can select locations for land-use change according to any of three decision rules based on (1) nearest neighbors, (2) stratification by political sub-region, and/or (3) the pattern of biogeophysical attributes. GEOMOD2 simulates the progressive loss of closed-canopy forest in Costa Rica for 1940, 1961 and 1983, which are the years for which maps of land-use are available. Also, GEOMOD2 extrapolates the pattern of land-use to the year 2010. When GEOMOD2 extrapolates land-use change over several decades, it is able to classify correctly between 74 and 88% of the grid cells, for two categories: forest versus non-forest. Over various simulation runs, Kappa ranges from 0.31 to 0.53. The model’s ability to predict the location of disturbance is best when the model is driven by the location of biogeophysical characteristics, most importantly lifezones.

AB  - The paper starts by distinguishing between two types of software evolution studies. The first addresses evolution as a noun and focuses on it as a phenomenon. The second addresses the topic as a verb and focuses on methods and tools intended to facilitate software evolution and the tasks that implement it. Both views are necessary to achieve increased insight and a degree of mastery of the evolution phenomenon and to develop improved tools and technology.  Keywords: co-evolution, noun and verb, management, software evolution, software process, tools  1 INTRODUCTION  The universal experience that software that is used undergoes continuing evolution was first discussed in the early seventies [leh74]. More recently the theme of evolution has roused widespread interest as demonstrated by various workshops, conferences and research investigations. In the context of this activity it is apparent that those involved divide into two groups. The first and larger group is concerned with the quest...

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between the planning of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the realisation that the physical environment is an important determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental well-being and community, the local economy and income, health inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of housing, economic development, land use and transport is a determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities. It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions. Wehave literally been building unhealthy conditions intomanyof our towns and cities. But comparisons with the best cities in Europe indicate that it is possible to reverse the less desirable trends. Success depends, however, on more radical policies of local authority control over land and finance than any political party has yet advocated. It also requires collaboration between the full range of powerful public and private organizations that influence the built environment. Future research is likely to further strengthen these conclusions. It will become much more obvious that planning for health and well-being is not only the NHS, but about creating a health-promoting physical, social and economic environment.
