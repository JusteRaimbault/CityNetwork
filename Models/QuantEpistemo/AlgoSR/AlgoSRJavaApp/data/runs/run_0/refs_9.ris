AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - Planners often use land price models as tools to support coordinated\nland use-transportation planning, and as instruments to measure the\nbenefits of land use and transportation improvements, particularly when\nconsidering a value capture approach to alternative taxation\npossibilities. In this paper, we present a land price model\ncharacterized by the use of spatial data in a spatial context, by the\nuse of a spatial association parameter and a formal definition of\nneighborhood that we interpret as elements of an economic externality.\nOur model analyzes the effects of some usual land use and accessibility\nvariables, and the magnitude of external economies affecting prices\nusing a spatially switching autoregressive model. Using as a case study\nthe city of Sendai in northeastern Japan (pop. about 1 million), we find\nconsiderable presence of spatial external economies, and heterogeneous\neffects of the price determinants between the CBD and the rest of the\ncity.

AB  - Transportation congestion is reaching intolerable levels in many urban and suburban areas in the U S. Reliance upon traditional responses, such as transit and new highway capacity, is not working -- especially in suburban areas. Although methods for dealing with suburban congestion are often different, there are a number of common features that must be considered in developing short term as well as more permanent and long lasting solutions. In proposing short term solutions, a "Menu of Actions" is described. It includes transportation actions (the traditional transit and transportation management options) where there are opportunities for getting more out of the existing systems; land use/growth management actions which will result in more rational land use-transportation interactions; financial incentives, to encourage or discourage appropriate actions; more comprehensive and systematic land use and transportation planning; and the organizational and institutional actions required to implement rational solutions. While the "Mann of Actions" provides a broad array of possible actions to provide relief in the short run, over time the growth in traffic is likely to outpace their effectiveness. Consequently, longer term and often more difficult solutions must be considered and implemented as appropriate. They could include changes in land use development and land use management policies; changes in lifestyle and business practices; improvements through technological innovation; changes in the traditional ways of providing transportation services; and greatly expanded research and development.

AB  - The paper describes the use of gaming simulation in the teaching of integrated land use-transportation planning as a part of an undergraduate civil engineering course. A key innovation of the UPTown game developed at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, is the way in which the actions of both public-sector planners and private-sector real estate developers are simulated by students. This allows students to explore the problems of conflicting objectives and to discover the value of cooperative planning in the land use and transportation development process. The paper describes the background to and rationale for an integrated planning course, and it explains the game and simulation aspects in detail. Assessment of student performance showed that the game significantly enhanced the achievement of learning outcomes. Students who faced more complex and open-ended tasks performed better, reaching higher levels of competence earlier on in the game. The paper should be of value to educators who wish to develop new approaches, such as gaming simulation, to respond to contemporary engineering students' preferences for more active and social learning styles.

AB  - Future land-use configurations provide valuable knowledge for policy makers and economic agents, especially under expected environmental changes such as decreasing rainfall or increasing temperatures. This chapter proposes an optimisation approach for modelling land-use change in which landscapes (land uses) are generated through the use of an evolutionary algorithm called GeneticLand. It is designed for a multiobjective function that aims at the minimisation of soil erosion and the maximisation of carbon sequestration, under a set of local restrictions. GeneticLand has been applied to a Mediterranean landscape, located in southern Portugal. The algorithm design and the results obtained show the feasibility of the generated landscapes, the appropriateness of the evolutionary methods to model land-use changes and the spatial characteristics of the landscape solutions that emerge when physical drivers have a major influence on their evolution.

The planning models used by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) were generally not designed to address these questions, creating a gap in the ability of planners to systematically assess these issues. UrbanSim is a new model system that has been developed to respond to these emerging requirements, and has now been applied in three metropolitan areas.

AB  - The common confusion of land cover and land use in many data sets is problematic for many data integration activities. This article proposes an approach for the separation of land cover and land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case, they provide building blocks that allow land cover and land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land cover) and function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land cover and locations where the concepts of use and cover are confused. The separation of land cover and land use facilitates the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the role of land use and transportation plans as policy instruments for promoting active community environments. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis using multilevel models to examine whether active community environment scores were associated with leisure and transportation-related physical activity (PA) and whether associations varied by household income. SETTING: 67 North Carolina counties SUBJECTS: Adults (n = 6694) from pooled 2000 and 2002 North Carolina Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys. MEASURES: Active community environment scores, derived from a 2003 survey of planning directors, representing the presence of nonmotorized transportation improvements, mixed land use classification, and comprehensiveness of implementation tools. Dependent variables were self-reported PA measures from the BRFSS. Sociodemographic variables were derived from the 2000 U.S. Census of Population. RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, more favorable active community environment scores were significantly associated with leisure PA (p = .001), transportation PA (p < .01), bicycling (p < .05), walking 150 minutes/week (p < .001), and meeting PA recommendations (p < .0001). In stratified analyses, lower-income individuals (<$25, 000) living in high scoring counties were three times more likely to participate in transportation PA compared with those living in low scoring counties (95% confidence interval, 1.4, 7.3). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies previously unexamined policy and institutional correlates of PA related to land use and transportation planning. Plans may provide a means to incorporate community support for active living into public policy.

Variables projected concern both land use (e. g. , number of single-family housing units) and choice of transit mode. Forecasts are made for 1990 and 2000 for four spatial zones within San Jose. Delphi panelists are individuals familiar with land use and transportation issues in the San Jose area. A preliminary questionnaire survey is used to set general economic conditions and land use policies that serve as a context for specific forecasts of land use-transportation interactions. Strengths and weaknesses of the Delphi method in forecasting land use are assessed.

AB  - Strong pressure on landscapes in South Korea from urbanisation is leading to severe environmental problems, changes in landscape character, and loss and fragmentation of woodlands which threaten biodiversity. Sustainable land use approaches for nature conservation are urgently needed to effectively counter these trends. This research develops and tests a methodological approach to assess the biodiversity potential of landscapes in city regions to provide the necessary information for this purpose. Landscape character assessment, an approach developed in the UK, is adapted and tested in Kwangju, a fast growing city region in the South west of the Korean peninsula. Twelve landscape character types are distinguished and landscape metrics (landscape heterogeneity, patch shape, patch context and patch distance) are customised to provide quantitative information on their biodiversity potential. Only land cover data that could be obtained from existing topographical maps and aerial photographs is required for this approach. It is suggested that the methodology presented in this paper can provide the necessary information to support sustainable land use planning for nature conservation in Korean city regions and elsewhere.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the anthropogenic forcing of geomorphic systems, specifically how nineteenth century land-use changes impacted watershed hydrologic, upland erosional, and sediment delivery subsystems of Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. Identification and analysis of the timing and rate of change in these subsystems, and the reestablishment of presettlement conditions, were used to address landscape sensitivity and watershed inheritance issues in a region undergoing population expansion and development. Archival research was used to reconstruct concurrent land-use changes in the catchments of two nineteenth century water-powered mills. Changes in the physical properties of mill pond sediments including, organic content, particle size distribution, and magnetic susceptibility, were used to interpret trends in sediment source during the span of mill operation. Interpolation of augering and coring data was used to determine mill pond sediment mass and pond capacity. Hillslope hydrologic change occurred almost immediately following land conversion. Upland erosion began with the removal of A-horizon fines, and progressed with the removal of A-horizon coarse particulates, and then B-horizon particulates. Change from one source category to another was punctuated by high flow events signifying an integration of human activity and climate in the changing of system boundary conditions

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

The object of this thematic issue of the Journal of Transport and Land Use is to report on this work and to illustrate the various ways UrbanSim has been adapted. However, this special issue is more than just a collection of progress reports. A central theme running through all the papers is that integrated land use-transportation modeling in Europe presents a series of challenges and demands not necessarily present in the United States context in which UrbanSim was developed. Thus, while the UrbanSim system can be technically adapted to European studies given the data and resources, the prevailing land-use transportation environment in Europe differs from the United States.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of land use change requires robust documentation on the characteristics of change. Land use change observation and monitoring programs now rely on remotely sensed data coupled with field observations and corroborating information describing the social, economic, and physical dimensions of land use and land cover. Remote sensing approaches for observing and monitoring change vary depending on the geographic scope, ecological complexity, and the information required to understand ecosystem interactions. Strategies based on identifying spectral variability are useful for targeting areas of rapid change. Measuring changes in land cover biophysical properties requires a more complex approach, where different dates of remotely sensed data are transformed to such variables as surface imperviousness, canopy structure, and phenology, and then compared. Mapping the conversion of land use and land cover from one category to another (e.g., forest to urban) requires maps of the land use and land cover for two or more periods. These approaches have been used successfully at local, regional, and global scales using a range of remote sensing data (e.g., aerial photography, Landsat Thematic Mapper, Terra MODIS, Space Imaging's IKONOS), field measurements, and other supplemental sources. Challenges remain, however, and scientific advances in change detection methods, accuracy assessment procedures, and improved strategies for using land cover to more specifically infer land use are needed so that continued improvements in the types and quality of change measures used to study land use and ecosystem interactions can be realized.

The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working. Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.

AB  - Planners have long been interested in understanding ways in which land use planning approaches play out on the ground and planning scholars have approached the task of evaluating such effects using a variety of methods. Oregon, in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies owing to its early-adopted and widely recognized statewide approach to farm and forest land protection and recent experiment with relaxation of that approach in 2004 with the passage of ballot Measure 37. In this paper we review research-based evidence regarding the forest and farm land conservation effects of Oregon land use planning. We document the evolution of methods used in evaluating state land use planning program performance, including trend analysis, indicator analysis, empirical models, and analysis of indirect effects on the economic viability of forestry and farming. We also draw on data documenting Measure 37 claims to consider the degree to which Measure 37 might have altered land use and development trends had its impacts not been tempered by a subsequent ballot measure - Measure 49. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the current state of knowledge and suggest opportunities for future research. Common to nearly all of the studies we reviewed was an acknowledgement of the difficulty in establishing causal relationships between land use planning and land use change given the many exogenous and endogenous factors involved. Despite these difficulties, we conclude that sufficient evidence does exist to suggest that Oregon's land use planning program is contributing a measurable degree of protection to forest and farm land in the state. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore theoretically the qualitative impacts of the planning and development processes on the spatial dynamic interactions between land use and transportation. Specifically, an idealized abstract example of the interactions between two homogeneous regions was studied with respect to various issues related to land use and transportation planning. The study took the form of systems of simple differential equations. Each equation represents the rate of change of either the land use or the transportation condition of a region. Investigation with the two-region model suggested a possibility of spatial and temporal fluctuations under certain planning conditions. By examining the conditions underlying the model equations, planning and developmental practices that may cause system instabilities were identified and discussed.

AB  - This paper offers some reflections regarding the application of regional and provincial laws concerning major industrial risks and urban and land use planning, and focuses on their application problems and capabilities with reference to some practical cases. The European Directive "Seveso 2" was implemented in Italy with two national laws, and in Piedmont they were enforced with the "Guidelines for the assessment of industrial risk in land use planning". According to the Guidelines, the municipalities had to introduce into their urban and land use planning instruments new criteria for the areas around Seveso plants. The application of the Guidelines requires a multidisciplinary approach but local authorities are often not sufficiently prepared for this kind of multilevel analysis, because they do not have the human or economic resources or even the technical abilities necessary to conduct it. As a result, they can underestimate the importance of a correct urban and land planning in the areas around major risk installations. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This research addresses land use and land cover change and the policies that relate to that change in a Midwestern (USA) watershed. Changes in land use/cover over 20 years were studied, with a primary focus on changing forest cover and its distribution. The hypothesis at the outset was that as urbanized area increased and agricultural area decreased, forested areas would decline. Local land use policies were studied for their impact on changing forest cover. Analyses of land use/cover in the watershed show a significant increase in forest cover, simultaneous with decreased agriculture and increased urban use. However, local land use planning measures for protecting forest and open space land were found to be negligible throughout the watershed. Land use planning at the watershed level is analyzed and a stronger authority at this level is recommended. © 1995.

Because habitat or climatic change substantially affects intermediate invertebrate hosts involved in many prevalent diseases, this chapter provides a basic description of vector-borne disease biology as a foundation for analyzing the effects of land use change. Urban sprawl poses health challenges stemming from heat waves exacerbated by the "urban heat island" effect, as well as from water contamination due to expanses of impervious road and concrete surfaces. Dams, irrigation and agricultural development have long been associated with diseases such as schistosomiasis and filariasis. Better management methods are required to address the trade-offs between expanded food production and altered habitats promoting deadly diseases. Deforestation can increase the nature and number of breeding sites for vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and onchocerciasis. Human host and disease vector interaction further increases risk, as can a change in arthropod-vector species composition.

AB  - This paper reports on the culmination of a two year project to facilitate “smart growth” planning in the Las Vegas, Nevada metropolitan area. Using a group model building process, representatives of key municipal entities and resource management agencies developed a model for examining the potential effects of changes in land use and transportation planning on air quality, traffic congestion, and other quality of life factors. The model and the process both contributed significantly to broadening systems thinking capacity in regional planning. The model supports system-based policy evaluation and the process created a common systems language among the more than 20 land use, transportation, and air quality planners in the group. The model represents regional links between population, transportation infrastructure, land use characteristics, and air pollution. Model analysis shows that the most powerful tool for achieving policy objectives is a combination of land use design and transportation infrastructure that reduces the average number of trips per day and distance per trip. This paper describes the model, results of the analysis, and effects of the group model building process on the participants.

AB  - Forestry projects in Nigeria have experienced growing land use competition, conflicts and a widening communication gap between foresters and traditional landowners. Land use is influenced by short-term financial benefits and a trial and error approach to the conservation of forest resources which eventually leads to destructive use of resources and the environment. However, reliable conservation of resources can be achieved through a review of forest policies, improved enforcement, adequate funding and involvement by rural communities In planning and execution of forestry projects.

AB  - In this summary chapter, we highlight three over-arching patterns among the ecosystem responses presented by the chapters in this volume. The first pattern is one of altered abundances and fluxes of water, nutrients, energy and species in ecosystems-always taking place initially after land use change, and often evolving and persisting over some extended period of time. A second repeating pattern is that there are clear bioclimatic and edaphic controls over the vulnerability of ecosystems to degradation during land use. A third emergent pattern is that indirect, unintended responses are ubiquitous across all types of land use and represent additional trade-offs in ecosystem services that go well beyond the direct impacts of land use change. Combined, these three patterns provide a conceptual basis upon which to develop a framework for systematic assessment of ecosystem responses to land use and land use change.

AB  - Integrated land use transportation models have been evolved as the primary metropolitan planning vehicle in the last several decades as the world development and urbanization continues. Urban regions continue planning for development of their urbanized areas using these modeling processes. Land use/demographic forecasting models provide the main input for the travel demand models, yet until recently the rigorous application of such models in the integrated land use transportation process was scanty except for the largest metropolitan areas. Such models require consideration of environmental factors and modeling of metropolitan economic systems. Theoretical and technological advancement of the last few decades has instigated a new wave of attention, research and further developments of the models and techniques from a variety of disciplines. This article briefly discusses the advancements and provides a guideline for their future improvements. It also discusses importance of role of national government and legislative mandates in ascertaining quality of planning process by reviewing some excerpts from U.S. legislation.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - The different approaches that other countries take to land use reflect many national variables, including planning systems, institutional structures, socio-cultural characteristics, population pressures and environmental priorities. Literature reviews of relevant land-use issues in Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Sweden provided the background material for this paper. Other European countries appear to offer models of more pro-active and indicative land-use planning, in contrast to the adversarial system in the UK, and a much stronger regional focus. This seems to have made it easier to implement other policies, for example on renewable energy. Experience with liberalisation of agricultural markets, and the promotion of environmentally sustainable farming are both relevant to an increasingly polarised agricultural sector in the UK. Cutting across all these themes is a reflection on governance of land use. Of the countries considered, Sweden's focus on environmental sustainability, international responsibility and long-term consistency of direction appears to be most closely aligned to the coming land-use challenges. When drawing conclusions from this review it is important to bear in mind the effect of differences in bio-geographic factors, socio-economic conditions and political culture, both in other countries and within the UK. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly.\n\nLonger term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production – offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping – along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production.

A review of these studies is made and a qualitative assessment is attempted of the technical phases land-use planning, trip-generation, trip-distribution, modal-split, traffic assignment and evaluation. Full summary results of this comparative survey are presented in tabular form, although themes developed in the text are illustrated with specific examples from individual studies. The methodology of land-use/transportation studies has been attacked by some Australian writers.

AB  - Traditional land use planning approaches relied significantly on biophysical data and followed a hierarchical top-down approach. The component of primary stakeholders as being critical to the success of implementing such plans is often ignored. In India, a large-scale geo-information project called “integrated mission for sustainable development (IMSD)” was undertaken in aid of land use planning. Biophysical data were generated at regional scale using remote sensing data and conventional survey methods. Land and water management plans have been developed for use by district level land use planning officials. However, it is observed that the acceptance rate of the plans by farmers is below the expectations of the land use planners. To understand the reasons, this paper applies the soft systems methodology to systematically analyse the programme and to suggest modifications in the existing procedures. The FAO guidelines for land use planning have been taken as a reference for evaluating technically the existing IMSD procedures. It is concluded that in the current approach the emphasis is predominantly on biophysical components with a low priority for the socio-economic factors. To increase the acceptance rate of the plans, it is argued that the socio-economic context has to be better integrated in the generation of the plans. Studies set in the IMSD study areas are discussed where an integration of soft and hard systems is attempted.

AB  - This report on Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF) is the response to the invitation by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to develop good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). GPG-LULUCF provides supplementary methods and good practice guidance for estimating, measuring, monitoring and reporting on carbon stock changes and greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF activities under Article 3, paragraphs 3 and 4, and Articles 6 and 12 of the Kyoto Protocol. The GPG-LULUCF assists countries in producing inventories for the land use, land-use change and forestry sector that are neither over- nor underestimates so far as can be judged, and in which uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. It supports the development of inventories that are transparent, documented, consistent over time, complete, comparable, assessed for uncertainties, subject to quality control and quality assurance, and efficient in the use of resources. The GPG-LULUCF is consistent with the existing good practice guidance for the other sector and addresses: • \t Choice of estimation method within the context of the IPCC Guidelines; • \t Quality assurance and quality control procedures to provide cross-checks during the inventory compilation; • \t Data and information to be documented, archived and reported to facilitate review and assessment of inventory estimates; • \t Quantification of uncertainties at the source or sink category level and for the inventory as a whole, so that resources available can be directed toward reducing uncertainties over time, and the improvement can be tracked.

AB  - Conservation subdivisions have emerged as a development option for communities wishing to conserve important ecological features and maintain rural character without decreasing housing density. Yet, these alternatives to conventional subdivisions rarely are used. We used logistic regression models to identify variables that predict county level success at adopting an ordinance and having a conservation subdivision built. Important predictors for adopting ordinances were median income, percent urban population, and a negative interaction between the two variables; important predictors for successfully completing a conservation subdivision were the adoption of an ordinance allowing conservation subdivisions and percent of residents with at least a four year college degree. Urban counties and the rural counties with higher median income were most successful adopting ordinances. Urban counties with higher education levels and an ordinance in place were most likely to have a conservation subdivision built within them. In poor rural counties, implementation may be more difficult because of limited resources to develop ordinances; these counties could collaborate with land trusts, other planning departments, or a regional council of governments to help lessen the financial burden associated with rewriting ordinances and implementing new land use practices. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Boardman River flows through Grand Traverse and Kalkaska Counties in Northwest Michigan before flowing into Grand Traverse Bay at Traverse City. Approximately two million recreation user days are estimated to occur on the Boardman River each year. Many of these recreators come to fish the river, others enjoy scenic trails, camping, and paddling. Beginning in 1867, four small dams were constructed on the Boardman. The dams were constructed primarily to generate hydropower. However, as the dams have aged their commercial viability as hydroelectric stations diminished. As a result, Traverse City Light and Power did not seek to renew the leases of those dams. Because of this, the dams’ owners (Grand Traverse County and the City of Traverse City) sought a cost-effective, environmentally and socially responsible dam-management outcome. The resulting process is considered one of the most comprehensive studies of its type ever undertaken in the United States. This process created the Boardman River Dams Committee (BRDC), an inclusive and diverse group of property owners, private citizens, agencies, nonprofits, businesses, scientific experts, and students. The BRDC involved over 1,000 people in 180 public meetings and the assessment of 91 options for the future of the dams. In April 2009, the Traverse City Commission and Grand Traverse County Board of Commissioners reviewed the scientific data and recommendations provided by the BRDC, and voted to remove three of the dams and install fish passage on the fourth.

AB  - Due to additional trip production by land use development, the O-D travel costs between some O-D pairs may also change intuitively. This leads to positive and negative impacts on network users traveling between different O-D pairs. Therefore the equity issue about the benefit distribution gained from the land-use development problem is raised. This paper proposes an Equity based Land-Use Transportation Problem (ELUTP) which is intended to examine the benefit distribution among the network users and the resulting equity associated with land-use development problem in terms of the change of equilibrium O-D travel cost. In the resulting bi-level programming model, the upper level sub-problem maximizes traffic production incorporating equity constraints, while the lower level sub-problem is a combined trip distribution/assignment user equilibrium problem. Genetic algorithm based method is applied to test the models using an example network.

AB  - This paper summarizes land-cover and land-use change at eight sites in Thailand, Yunnan (China), Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos over the last 50 years. Project methodology included incorporating information collected from a combination of semiformal, key informant, and formal household interviews with the development of spatial data-bases based on aerial photographs, satellite images, topographic maps, and GPS data. Results suggest that land use (e.g. swidden cultivation) and land cover (e.g. secondary vegetation) have remained stable and the minor amount of land-use change that has occurred has been a change from swidden to monocultural cash crops. Results suggest that two forces will increasingly determine land-use systems in this region. First, national land tenure policies-the nationalization of forest lands and efforts to increase control over upland resources by central governments-will provide a push factor making it increasingly difficult for farmers to maintain their traditional swidden land-use practices. Second, market pressures-the commercialization of subsistence resources and the substitution of commercial crops for subsistence crops-will provide a pull factor encouraging farmers to engage in new and different forms of commercial agriculture. These results appear to be robust as they come from eight studies conducted over the last decade. But important questions remain in terms of what research protocols are needed, if any, when linking social science data with remotely sensed data for understanding human-environment interactions

AB  - This paper asks the question, to what extent do market forces limit planning policies? It delves into the constraining relationship of market forces on planning by reference to urban policies in the UK. In this context market forces are defined as dominant long term spatial economic trends which promote decentralisation. The essay uses policy case studies to develop its arguments. In general planning is shown to suffer from the lack of a systematic analysis of land use markets. Yet at its heart planning not only regulates/constrains the property market it also shapes and stimulates it. Planning is found to be most successful when it is shaping urban growth and decentralisation. It is a fundamentally different task to stem market flows and the probability of success is very different. Market forces do limit routes to Utopian aspirations but planners need the motivation, understanding and means to work with the market to produce desired outcomes. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper is by no means comprehensive, but aims to provide the reader with a foundation in the basic principles underlying land-use–transportation models and to set those principles in the context of urban management and urban studies. The paper opens with taxonomy of urban simulation models and a treatment of descriptive and analytical models. This serves to situate land-use–transportation models in the context of a broader simulation environment. The paper then reviews land-use–transportation models according to their simulation techniques and individual components. Towards the second half of the paper, the discussion moves to a critical overview of urban simulation and deals with model weaknesses and strengths in a holistic fashion, before concluding with a discussion of some innovations in academic research that are likely to shape future models.

AB  - Sustainable land use planning is crucial for realizing the aim of food security and for combating land degradation in the Sahel. A participatory land use planning workshop was organised in a village in the eastern region of Burkina Faso to investigate land use problems, their causes, effects and possible solutions. Participatory research tools and GIS were combined to get insight into possible conflicts or synergies between different land use options as mapped by different ethnic groups. Pictograms were used to locate alternative land use options on the map, after which they were digitised for analysis with GIS. The workshop confirms the importance of integrating scientific and local knowledge to develop concrete options for sustainable land use that fit to local realities and aspirations. Local people are knowledgeable about the driving forces behind land degradation, they take actions to combat the effects of degradation, and they have concrete ideas about alternative land use options. The use of GIS proved its added value in the participatory process of integrated land use planning. The maps that were produced also facilitate discussions between community members, researchers and government representatives at the regional level, both regarding current land use problems and regarding alternative options as perceived by the local population.

AB  - In the complex agro-ecological conditions of Vietnam's northern borderlands, attempts by ethnic minority farmers to create sustainable livelihoods, along with the impacts of state development policies, have direct consequences for land use and land cover (LULC) change. In this paper we analyse the degree to which LULC has changed and diversified from 1999 to 2009 in Lào Cai Province and the underlying relationships with ethnic minority livelihood diversification strategies. We examine the correlation between LULC diversity and various socioeconomic and biophysical proxies using a spatial autoregressive model. Our findings indicate two major changes in LULC: an increase in closed canopy forest and substantial urban growth. LULC diversity increased between 1999 and 2009, suggesting a transition between land uses and/or a diversification of livelihood strategies. Socioeconomic proxies are significant predictors of LULC diversity in both years, while biophysical proxies are only effective predictors in 2009. In-depth interviews regarding state-led policies and ethnic minority livelihoods reveal some of the underlying mechanisms of such LULC transitions and associations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present work explores the synergies between socio-metabolic energy use and landscape patterns, starting from the hypothesis that there is a complex and changing relationship between the efficiency in both the societal use of energy, and land-use, and the ecosystem functioning of the whole land matrix of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). It first compares changes in the social metabolism (i.e. the total energy or material throughput of the economy) and in landscape structure and function from 1850 to the present in three municipalities of the Vallès county (N of the BMR), as a first attempt to establish a link between the societal uses of land and energy together with their impact on landscape patterns. Secondly, the study explores the role of natural versus rural landscapes on the maintaining of basic functional properties such as connectivity in the whole BMR. We base our analyses on parametric methodologies that describe both structural and functional properties of landscapes, aimed at assessing the landscape efficiency of both energy-use and land-use planning. The first comparison reveals that the simultaneous loss of energy efficiency and land-use efficiency from the mid-19th century to present can be tracked by changes in the functional landscape structure. The second study shows the importance of the traditional rural landscapes in maintaining the ecological quality of non-built-up land. In consequence, the organized complexity of the land system necessary to host biodiversity and basic ecological processes cannot be guaranteed if the agro-forestry mosaic is not taken into account, together with the network of protected areas. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland.

AB  - Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) Insurance, or mileage-based insurance, has the potential to be an effective transportation pricing strategy with multiple benefits including reductions in vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, and vehicle emissions. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), in partnership with Progressive County Mutual Insurance Company (Progressive), conducted a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of implementing mileage-based insurance and whether such a program would impact driver behavior. During the first phase of the study, a statistical analysis of available data produced a positive correlation between mileage driven and accident frequency, thus validating the hypothesis that insurance companies can provide financial incentives to customers who drive fewer miles because of an associated reduction in claims costs. A second phase of the pilot program offered financial incentives to volunteer participants who were able to reduce their mileage from a personal baseline condition. Data collected from the participants' vehicle on-board diagnostic system resulted in an average mileage reduction of five percent. Additional spatial analysis concluded that mileage reduction was independent of participant residence suggesting PAYD Insurance would be a viable strategy to minimize negative environmental impacts region-wide. © ASCE.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

AB  - Oregon's landmark land use planning system has been criticized for imposing large negative effects on landowners' property values, although evidence to support these claims has been lacking. This paper examines longitudinal data for undeveloped parcels since before adoption of the planning system. The sample includes parcels under different land use regulations, and it compares Oregon to Washington. The results indicate generally that property values have increased at similar rates both inside and outside urban growth boundaries, and across parcels zoned for different uses and across state lines. The results are consistent both with theory and with other studies indicating land use regulations can have positive, neutral or negative effects. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay. ?? 2006.

AB  - A method is proposed that planners and stakeholders can use to select an optimal land use plan that balances the socioeconomic benefits and environmental costs of regional growth. It entails seven steps: (1) specifying alternative growth futures; (2) formulating land use policies to alleviate potential adverse environmental impacts of alternative futures; (3) evaluating socioeconomic and environmental impacts (outcomes) with land use policies and alternative futures; (4) using a multiple attribute utility function to score outcomes and rank land use plans based on those scores; (5) determining an optimal plan for stakeholders based on some decision criterion; (6) employing a conflict resolution method to resolve stakeholder disagreements about optimal plans; and (7) using passive adaptive management to determine whether an implemented plan remains optimal over time. The proposed method is demonstrated for a hypothetical case study that incorporates: (1) low, medium, and high future growth rates for major industries in a region; (2) unrestrictive, moderately restrictive, and highly restrictive land use policies that limit the location and density of residential and non-residential development; (3) economic output and habitat fragmentation attributes of outcomes; (4) a linear additive, multiple attribute utility function; (5) pro-development, neutral, and pro-environment stakeholder preferences for attributes; and (6) optimal plan selection based on the maximin principle. Results for the hypothetical case study indicate that the ranking of the three plans and the optimal plan differ across the three stakeholder groups, and the optimal collective plan varies depending on which conflict resolution method is used and whether the assessment is ex ante or ex post. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is concluded that urban agriculture contributes to food self-sufficiency and helps raise the nutritional standards of poor urban residents who are otherwise unemployed or holding down low-paying (juakali) occupations, particularly female-headed households. Therefore, there is a need to formulate a comprehensive land use plan which incorporates food production and socioeconomic structures for urban centres in Kenya.

AB  - In recent years, the use of visioning processes and scenario-planning tools for developing regional land-use scenarios has become rather common. Typically, visioning is performed as a cooperative, inclusive process among business owners, community residents, interest groups, and local officials, and results in broad goals and principles which can guide future policies and plans. This is a very different approach than a land-use modeling process, which is typically generated by technical experts and results in a set of probable future trends and indicators which can guide the implementation of growth management strategies. The scenario-planning tools typically used for visioning processes are designed to generate and compare potential and preferred future development scenarios based on stakeholder values and preferences, whereas land-use models are used to predict likely future development patterns based on mathematical equations, reflecting historical trends, and market forces. Consequently, direct comparisons of results for the two methods are not really relevant. However, it is important to understand how the two approaches differ and that both offer their own relative advantages from a planning perspective. In an effort to better appreciate what each approach offers, this paper compares and contrasts these two methods, featuring the Austin metropolitan statistical area as a case study. The preferred vision, produced by the Envision Central Texas organization, offers the greatest potential for public involvement in identifying regional development goals for the future. The land-use models have a strong theoretical foundation and allow for interactions with a transportation model. Moreover, the land-use models have the potential to identify key strategies that can be used in achieving the region's goals. Thus, the combination of these two approaches seems to offer the greatest opportunities for planners to achieve a future that accommodates all stakeholders.  2008 ASCE.

AB  - In a context where several sectors of society compete for space, land use types must be carefully designed and spatially allocated to guarantee a sufficient level of relevant ecosystem services (ES) in a territory of interest. In this respect, contemporary land use planning involves multiple, often conflicting objectives and criteria. Consequently, major benefits can be expected from spatial decision support systems (sDSS) designed to deal with complex spatial allocation problems.This paper presents the generic conceptual framework 'OSMOSE' and its free and open source software implementation, for the generation of specific sDSSs for spatial land use planning. The specific sDSSs generated with OSMOSE are meant to (i) identify land units which meet multiple predefined ES-attribute values for a specific land use type (LUT) and (ii) rank land units for a given LUT according to these multiple ES-attributes. A complementary purpose is to (i) identify and (ii) rank LUTs for a given land unit. Whereas 'identification' is done by means of a threshold query, 'ranking' is based on the Iterative Ideal Point Thresholding (IIPT) method. The proposed framework is extremely flexible as it can accommodate differentially weighted, continuous and/or ordinal attributes with, for the latter, equal or unequal number of classes, alternative land unit definitions and land use types. Moreover, assessments cannot only be made using ES-levels for the land unit/LUT combinations but also in terms of changes in ES-levels after a particular change of LUT.The OSMOSE framework is illustrated by means of the specific sDSS BoLa which is generated to support land use planning in the region of Flanders (Belgium) with focus on soil protection. Four cases are presented in which the decision support varies between the available approaches (threshold - selection, threshold - ranking, IIPT - selection, IIPT - ranking). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The paper aims to position the concept of adaptive efficiency in planning theory, by providing insights on the conditions that explain why land use planning in some institutional contexts is able to adapt and improve more efficiently than in others. This is done by focusing on a specific planning goal: the control of residential sprawl. The paper presents a theoretical framework based on two models, one on the coordinating mechanisms regarding the use of land and one to explain institutional changes. This framework is exploited with empirical case studies where we compare the control of sprawl in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland. The analysis diagnoses a duality of planning practices. Even though planning failures occur in the Netherlands as well, we provide evidence that Dutch land use planning has been able to efficiently adapt regulatory instruments and collaborative practices to societal changes. By contrast, Belgian and Polish planners face huge difficulties to incorporate new initiatives to control urban sprawl or, in more general terms, to reinforce their influence on land uses. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This thesis explores the potential of applying genetic algorithms (GAs) to multi-objective land-use planning. Rural land managers, in the UK and elsewhere in Europe, are faced with an increasingly complex decision-making environment where a varied mix of goals have to be achieved. To address this problem, GA-based land-use planning tools have been developed that interface with a decision support system. The thesis rst evaluates the options for representing the land-use planning problem within a GA framework. Two genotype representations are proposed: a genotype mapping land-use directly to land parcels (Land-Block), and a representation making allocations indirectly via a greedy algorithm (P&P). The P&P representation requires novel breeding operators and post-evaluation processing, to identify and remove duplicate or defective genotypes. The performance of the two GAs' was evaluated for a single-objective land-use planning problem. Since both GAs found acceptable solutions, two multi-objective genetic algorithms (mGAs) were implemented based on the proposed representations. The goal of these mGAs was to search for a set of solutions dening the structure of the relationship between two or more objectives. To achieve this goal, modications are required to the calculation of selection-tness and the implementation of parent selection. The mGAs were tested for a problem with two con icting objectives, with the Land-Block mGA found to have superior performance. Given the non-standard nature of the GAs, it was necessary to investigate their parameterisation, in particular the balance between the GA-operators over the course of the run. Two online-optimisation approaches were tested. The use of online-optimisation was successful in signicantly improving the eÆciency of the GAs. To investigate the usefulness of the GAs and mGAs for decision support, two further investigations were carried out. In the rst the scalability of the two representations was tested for a single-objective problem. The P&P GA outperformed the Land-Block, since the complexity of the P&P genotype depends on the number of land-uses present in the optimal solution, not on the number of land parcels to be allocated a land use. Second, the sets of solutions found by the mGAs were compared with allocations collected, using soft-systems methods, from professional land-managers with a range of backgrounds. The mGAs found solutions as good as those proposed by the land managers. Additional factors that needed to be accounted for by the mGA were identied, but the mGA solutions were seen by the land-managers as forming a useful basis for practical land-use planning.

In this context observers have endorsed rural land use planning as a way to insure that, at least in theory, lands get devoted to their best uses. In practice, land use planning in the developing world has resembled organized anarchy. Small landholders with insecure land tenure, overseas investors seeking large land deals, NGOs representing indigenous peoples, government officials, and staff from international environmental NGOs and multilateral organizations have come together in strategic action fields to struggle over and sometimes negotiate land use plans for contested landscapes. These plans represent a strategic, spatially explicit response to the climate change biodiversity food security crisis

AB  - Urban containment strategies are one of the best-known planning instruments for managing urban sprawl. The two main types of such strategies are greenbelts and urban growth boundaries. The boundaries set by the Land Use Plan in Switzerland have been applied since 1970. We evaluate the effect and success of this strategy by analysing expansion of developed land, change in number of buildings, and building density within and outside building zones in four Swiss municipalities 1970-2000. Our results show that the boundary restricted most development to building zones and promoted increased building density. Generally, building density increased in the building zones but decreased outside of building zones. For more efficiency and success, the political institutions should specify explicit goals for development inside and outside of building zones, and develop new instruments for guiding development outside of building zones. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The objective is to assess the ability of land use transportation models to address some current policy issues. The nature of the relationship between land use and transportation is examined briefly in terms of empirical evidence and the results from modeling exercises. Two studies that the use of such models and that are being carried out in Britain are examined. Despite these and some convincing arguments by expers, there is little evidence of widespread use of such models. A number of current policy issues are discussed, and then a set of policy instruments that can be used to meet the policy objectives are identified. Evidence on the ability of land use transportation models to represent the impacts of the policy instruments is presented. It is shown how such models can contribute significantly in some areas of policy analsys, for example, reducing congestion and energy use, but can contribute very little to the objective of moving toward a market economy.

AB  - This paper describes a series of tests carried out with a comprehensive transportation, land use and air quality simulation system, which has been designed for planning application at the metropolitan or regional scale, within the framework of the U.S. Government's Clean Air legislation. The urban location portion of the system was developed at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of S. H. Putman. The air quality sections incorporate models formulated in earlier studies. The system was tested with data from the San Francisco Bay area, for the period 1975–1980. The test policies included changes in regional transportation costs and population totals; local interventions in the transportation network; and controls on pollutant emissions from mobile and stationary sources. To assess net impacts, the outcomes predicted for each policy were compared with the outcomes predicted in a “benchmark”, or base run of the system. The tests showed that the system is sensitive to a broad range of air quality policies, and that it is capable of predicting important air quality consequences of transportation and land use policies. Some further development will be needed before the system can be used in practical planning situations, but there is little doubt as to the soundness of its central theoretical constructs and logical structure.

AB  - Over the last decades there has been intense focus on better understanding land-use-transportation relationships. One prominent research area within this nexus has examined whether urban structural characteristics, such as the balance of jobs and housing, impacts broader transportation patterns, particularly commuting outcomes. Researchers have sought to quantify relationships in comparative studies across space and time, without fully realizing the latter due to sparse data availability, mainly due to reliance on government census type products which often lack adequate temporal resolution. This research utilizes a relatively new database from the U.S. Census known as Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) to explore temporal commuting-land-use relationships. This database has a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution, with worker information reported annually from 2002 to 2010. Locations of workers, jobs, and their commute flows are resolved to the census block scale. We analyze LEHD data over a 9-year period from 2002 to 2010 for a mid-sized urban area. Estimation of several commuting and jobs-housing metrics lends insights into growth and decline that have occurred in the recent housing boom and bust, and their broader implications for travel patterns. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

AB  - The Extractive Reserve System is championed as a win–win model of sustainable development in which rubber tappers serve to protect the forest while improving economic growth and resident well-being. Recently, reserves are being questioned in terms of their environmental sustainability, as many rubber tappers increasingly turn to market agriculture in times of economic duress and instability. This study explores land-use/land-cover change in six rubber estates within the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve, using both remote sensing analysis and household surveys, and addresses the differences in deforestation by livelihood trajectories.Aremote sensing analysis between 1986 and 2003 shows that some communities are close to surpassing the allowable limits of deforestation. Rubber tapping plays a less important role in livelihood strategies, as welfare is linked to non-extractive activities. Households pursue diverse livelihood activities including extractivism, small-scale market cultivation, animal rearing, and cattle production. The results suggest that land-use/land-cover change is highly dynamic in the reserve.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between the planning of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the realisation that the physical environment is an important determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental well-being and community, the local economy and income, health inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of housing, economic development, land use and transport is a determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities. It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - Although there are only a limited number of rigorous research papers focussed specifically on land use perceptions, there is an extensive literature on: environmental attitudes in general and urban growth in particular, as well as on the land use perceptions of farmers and on public perceptions about the use of land for the production of food and raw materials. A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact. So the paper concludes with a discussion about future perceptions and possible behavioural change. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Marginal land provides an alternative potential for food and bioenergy production in the face of limited land resources; however, effective assessment of marginal lands is not well addressed. Concerns over environmental risks, ecosystem services and sustainability for marginal land have been widely raised. The objective of this study was to develop a hierarchical marginal land assessment framework for land use planning and management. We first identified major land functions linking production, environment, ecosystem services and economics, and then classified land resources into four categories of marginal land using suitability and limitations associated with major management goals, including physically marginal land, biologically marginal land, environmentally ecologically marginal land, and economically marginal land. We tested this assessment framework in southwestern Michigan, USA. Our results indicated that this marginal land assessment framework can be potentially feasible on land use planning for food and bioenergy production, and balancing multiple goals of land use management. We also compared our results with marginal land assessment from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and land capability classes (LCC) that are used in the US. The hierarchical assessment framework has advantages of quantitatively reflecting land functions and multiple concerns. This provides a foundation upon which focused studies can be identified in order to improve the assessment framework by quantifying high-resolution land functions associated with environment and ecosystem services as well as their criteria needed to improve the assessment framework. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Land use and transportation models are typically given precise inputs and return precise outputs. This precision should not be mistaken for accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to introduce uncertainty into three inputs and one parameter of a fully integrated land use and travel demand model - MEPLAN - to determine the effect of uncertain inputs on model outputs. Inputs were selected based upon there being expected sources of uncertainty. Inputs were varied individually based upon plausible amounts of error and the marginal impact of each on outputs was examined. Counter to the findings of previous similar studies, uncertainty in the socio-economic forecasts did not dominate the final amounts of error observed in the model outputs. The propagation of error across model years, as well as the final level of error in the end-year, is examined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A basic framework for the sensitivity analysis and continuous optimization of integrated land use/transportation model is proposed in this paper. It is shown that separate sensitivity analysis procedures for a land use model with exogenous travel costs and a transportation network with elastic demand can be combined to get a sensitivity analysis procedure for the integrated model. Sensitivity-analysis-based techniques can then be used for the optimal design of land use plans and transportation policies so that certain social surplus functions are optimized. The proposed method is illustrated with a residential location model with a congestible transportation network sub-model. ?? 2007 China Association for Science and Technology.

AB  - The concepts of integrated and sustainable management have been discussed in detail in resource management literature, but there has been less attention to practical ways to implement and evaluate the success of these concepts at the local level. Use of a normative model, based on key principles, evaluative questions and benchmark criteria, provides a practical and adaptable too] for the implementation and evaluation of integrated and sustainable management. This paper illustrates a method by which land use planning and water management activities may be evaluated through the development of a normative model, and discusses lessons learned from an application of the model to three study municipalities in the Province of Ontario, Canada.

AB  - The process of planning and constructing a new light rail system or freeway, setting an urban growth boundary, changing tax policy, or modifying zoning and land use plans is often politically charged. Our goal in the UrbanSim project is to provide tools for stakeholders to be able to consider different scenarios, and then to evaluate these scenarios by modeling the resulting patterns of urban growth and redevelopment, of transportation usage, and of environmental impacts, over periods of 20-30 years. UrbanSim, combined with transportation models and macroeconomic inputs, performs simulations of the interactions among urban development, transportation, land use, and environmental impacts. It consists of a set of interacting component models that simulate different actors or processes within the urban environment.

AB  - The management of land-use change has been achieved in Britain through the development control system. Set up in its modern form in 1947, the system has remained substantially unchanged in spite of a radically altered policy environment. This paper considers the nature of the system and notes both its robustness and its flexibility as well as the accusations of delay and uncertainty that are levelled at it. It considers the drivers for change which are likely to affect the system, and in particular the challenge of climate change, the rights of third parties, the question of major infrastructure projects, and the desire for neighbourhood protection. The paper concludes by asserting that there is a need to refocus the debate on the quality of outcomes rather than on the process. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - Land use and transportation models play an important role in guiding decisions about such matters as transportation infrastructure construction and land use policy. Previous land use and transportation modeling systems have largely been black boxes, understandable only by experts in the field. For the last several years we have been developing and deploying a land use modeling system, UrbanSim, which is integrated with a transportation model. We will be redesigning and generalizing this system, and in the process will attempt to open the black box. We plan to use a participatory design process, bringing in a variety of stakeholders, to determine what are the important attributes to model, how users should interact with the model, and how the results can be most usefully presented.

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role. This chapter describes two case studies that apply the genetic algorithm approach.

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

AB  - Rather than a bad case of urban sprawl, the physical expansion of China's megacities may be viewed as a combination of 'urban spill over' and 'local urban sprawl'. This paper reviews land use regulations in their institutional context and argues that conflicts in land use regulation are related to ideologies of land ownership and embedded in different planning doctrines. These hypotheses are investigated with special reference to Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province in southern China. The evidence suggests that entangled land use regulations for "urban" and "rural" land have imposed serious constraints on urban growth, while the contradictions of different policies and regulations in the use of rural lands for urban construction have led to intensive and unhealthy competition among stakeholders. As a result, not only have the costs of land conversion from rural to urban uses increased, but the spatial development of Guangzhou has been distorted. The implications of these failures for future policy are discussed with emphasis on the reform of the land use regulation system. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the last decades Mediterranean systems are being affected by important land use changes which are transforming the entire landscape. Traditional irrigated lands have constituted one of the most characteristic agro-landscapes in the Mediterranean and have played a relevant socio-economic, ecological and environmental role. However, these valuable agro-landscapes are progressively decaying due to recent socio-economic changes which, at the same time, are promoting new irrigated lands outside the river valleys. These new irrigated lands have a major effect on land, water resources, landscape and the biodiversity value of extensive tracts of the Mediterranean area. At the same time, Mediterranean drylands are quickly disappearing due to land abandonment. In addition, Mediterranean areas are suffering a quick urbanisation process affecting both natural and agricultural areas. These trends may be considered as a reduction of the most characteristically rural Mediterranean landscape to favour ecologically extreme landscapes: on one side the natural areas and on the other side the new irrigated lands and urban areas. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the factors driving the land use changes in the Mediterranean, to analyse their ecological effects and to explore the potential implications of several policies regarding land use and natural resources. To this aim, we have analysed the land use changes and their socio-economic and environmental context in three study cases in Southeastern Spain, an arid Mediterranean area where the four above-mentioned land use changes are taking place. These study cases are the traditional irrigated land of Murcia, the agricultural system of Mazarron-Aguilas and the land use changes in the Mar Menor watershed. The ancient Murcia irrigated lands constitutes a paradigmatic example of the loss of this valuable agro-landscape and its highly fertile soils due to the urbanisation process and spread of infrastructures. The Mazarron-Aguilas new irrigated lands may be considered as representative of the most intensive agricultural systems in the Mediterranean area, which are quickly spreading at the expense of drylands and natural areas. The Mar Menor watershed have suffered important agricultural and urban-tourist land use changes affecting the hydrological and nutrient dynamics and the biological communities of the coastal lagoon and associated wetlands. An integrated approach has been applied combining GIS, Remote Sensing, spatial and environmental modelling and dynamic system models to analyse the sustainability of these three case studies, the spatial and temporal patterns of land use, the main socio-economic and environmental driving factors and their ecological implications.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - Land use and land cover are important determinants of the state of the natural environment. As a result, measures of land use and land cover change have been widely used as indicators of environmental condition and quality. This review explores the range of measures that have been applied in the UK at national, regional and local scales, and their sensitivity to particular drivers of change. The extent to which these indicators are important properties in themselves or are surrogates for wider environmental qualities is considered. The discussion focuses on the evolving frameworks used to analyse the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment. The limitations and strengths of the DPSIR reporting and analytical framework are explored. Recent approaches to the assessment of the impacts of future land use change on the natural environment using model-based scenario methods are examined, and the need to develop new types of aggregate measure of land use function is identified. There is also a pressing need to link assessments of trends to the analysis of sustainability thresholds or limits. It is concluded that the concept of a socio-ecological system offers a more fruitful approach to the analysis of the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment than the simplistic cause-effect models that have been used in the past. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - An empirical assessment of the interaction between the land use—transportation system and travel behavior is presented. A methodology for identifying a range of land use—transportation systems by a clustering technique with network and land use inputs was developed. Twenty neighborhoods from Orange County, California, were considered in this process. Three groups, or themes, were found to best represent the neighborhoods in the sample area: one each associated with the conventional definition of traditional and neotraditional neighborhood design (TND) and planned unit development (PUD) neighborhoods and one representing neighborhoods that blend characteristics of TND and PUD. Conventional measures of individual travel behavior were compared with an analysis of variance between the themes to identify significant differences, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Research results include the development of (a) a systematic methodology to identify a more explicit land use—transportation dimension, (b) an estimate of the potential effectiveness of design-oriented solutions to reduce automobile congestion by using the developed themes, and (c) a preliminary assessment of the extent to which development themes can be used to improve the current modeling framework.

AB  - A combined transportation-land use model is proposed in this paper. Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

AB  - To address climate change, many U.S. states are taking action to establish policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all economic sectors. With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided. The information in this paper provides a starting-point for transportation practitioners to use when initiating their own evaluations of greenhouse gas mitigation options at the regional, state, or local level.

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - This themed issue of Land Use Policy builds mainly on papers presented at an international conference on 'Land Use Issues and Policy in China under Rapid Rural and Urban Transformation', convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, in October 2012. The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings from a range of disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems due to the nature of the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of this, this themed edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The pattern of urban development strongly affects sustainability - energy and water use, food production, waste generation and disposal, biodiversity and equal opportunity. So regional planning must be a tool in achieving sustainability. The traditional urban pattern was a cluster of activities that people do together (city downtowns and neighborhood centers) surrounded by residences in a density gradient. That remains the most sustainable pattern. After World War II, the automobile promoted a pattern of scattered activities and spread out residences. Most other countries resisted the spread and scattered pattern, though without complete success; the US has only begun to recentralize. Three strategies are proposed to recentralize: Pricing goods and services to reflect sustainable needs, improving the magnetism of cities and legislating enforceable regional plans. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A simple example and a more complicated urban-design case study are included to demonstrate the viability of this approach in solving the simultaneous-optimization problem. As a secondary benefit, this set-partitioning model can be reformulated as an integer, generalized-network, flow problem for which new efficient computer codes, capable of solving networks with thousands of nodes and variables, are available.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use component of a partially integrated land use-transportation modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel demand model (TDM), and travel times from the traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage over time. A factorized design approach is used to model uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model, as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results suggest that while several model inputs may affect model outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send shocks through the urban system. However, the level of uncertainty appears to come down in later years, as households, jobs, and developers respond to changed input conditions

AB  - A new approach to regional land use and transportation planning, which uses a genetic algorithm as an integrated optimization tool, is presented. The approach is illustrated by applying it to the Wasatch Front Metropolitan Region, which consists of four counties in the state of Utah. This genetic algorithm-based approach was applied earlier to the twin cities of Provo and Orem in Utah, but here it is adapted to regional planning. Three issues make regional planning particularly difficult: (a) individual cities have significant planning autonomy, (b) the search space of possible plans is immense, and (c) preferences between competing objectives vary among stakeholders. The approach used here addresses the first issue by the way the problem is formulated. The second issue is addressed with a genetic algorithm. Such algorithms are particularly well suited to problems with large search spaces. The third issue is addressed by using a multiobjective fitness function in the genetic algorithm. It was found that a genetic algorithm could produce a set of nondominated future land use scenarios and street plans for a region, from which regional planners can make a selection. Execution of the algorithm to produce 100 plans per generation for 100 generations took about 4 days with a high-end personal computer. Interesting trends for reducing change and traffic congestion were discovered.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the main drivers of many environmental change processes. It influences the basic resources of land use, including the soil. Its impact on soil often occurs so creepingly that land managers hardly contemplate initiating ameliorative or counterbalance measures. Poor land management has degraded vast amounts of land, reduced our ability to produce enough food, and is a major threat to rural livelihoods in many developing countries. To date, there has been no single unifying volume that addresses the multifaceted impacts of land use on soils. This book has responded to this challenge by bringing together renowned academics and policy experts to analyze the patterns, driving factors and proximate causes, and the socioeconomic impacts of soil degradation. Policy measures to prevent irreversible degradation and rehabilitate degraded soils are also identified.

Based on the DMOP approach, this study constructs an interactive dynamic multi-objective programming model, investigates the connection between land use and future urban development, and incorporates the preferences of decision makers using a compromise index. A case study from Taiwan shows that the proposed modeling framework can accommodate more complete information, allowing improvements to be made in strategic planning for land use.

AB  - Computer simulation plays an increasingly important role in engineering education as a tool for enhancing classroom learning. This research investigates the efficacy of using simulation in teaching the topic of transportation network growth through an experiment conducted at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota. In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional. The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research projects.

AB  - This paper documents a research project being carried out by the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT.) The goal of the project is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of urban areas through compatible systems-level planning of land uses, urban form, and investments in public transportation facilities. The project also seeks to improve the communication of these concepts to elected officials and the public through the development of enhanced visualization techniques. The research is intended to answer questions about the interactions of land use policies and transit investments, posed in two forms. First, if alternative transit investment proposals are being evaluated for a community, what land use policies will be needed to optimize the effectiveness of those investments? Second, if specific changes in land use policy are being considered for a community, what types of transit investment will be most cost-effective for each land use policy scenario?. © ASCE.

AB  - Although performance measures encourage agreement in other disciplines, measures for state transportation and land use may engender disagreement among stakeholders. A literature review and a survey of 25 states and three metropolitan planning organizations identified 41 such measures.  No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.  Further, when measures are computed under four benevolent scenarios that each generate the support of some stakeholders (reduced transit costs, reduced congestion, increased local autonomy, and increased compact development) some performance  measures indicate improvement and others do not.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analysis the performance capabilities of sewing machine operators (SMO) with best fit mathematical models (BFMM) developed. The models are developed on the field data collected during the planned experimentation by using full factorial plan. The values of input variables are changed for generating the actual values of dependent variables. The author in his earlier papers of formulation of experimental models, described in details the independent and dependent variables and the methodology adopted therein. In this paper, the analysis part of various models are discussed for 'Normal", 'Menstruation' and 'Menopause" conditions of female SMO. The total nine, best fit mathematical models (BFMM) are developed and the results are analysed, qualitatively as well as quantitatively and found ultimately complex in nature. But the degree of complexity appears least (4-juctions) in 'Normal' phase. Whereas maximum complexity (5-junctions) appears in 'Menstruation' and 'Menopause" condition. The subject shall be tested for all women factors during study but requires the substantial period which is not tolerable. Therefore SMOs of different ages are selected for covering various women factors. Since the environmental factors are uncontrollable, the effects are justified by planning the experimentation for a complete year, during different seasons. 'Normal' phase is more responsive to performance than other women phases. SIMOs require adjustable stool height convenient to their seating. The work of testing the effect of 'women factors' on the performance capability of sewing operation had been tested and evaluated for the first time and are important parameters to avoid the post ill-effect on health caused due to unhealthy situations at different stages of women workers during their lifetime

AB  - This paper examines ways that transportation decisions affect land use patterns and resulting economic, social and environmental impacts. These include direct impacts on land used for transportation facilities, and indirect impacts caused by changes to land use development patterns. In particular, certain transportation planning decisions tend to increase sprawl (dispersed, urban-fringe, automobile-dependent development), while others support smart growth (more compact, infill, multi-modal development). These development patterns have various economic, social and environmental impacts. This paper describes specific methods for evaluating these impacts in transport planning.

AB  - Although trust research has been extensive and substantial, the constitution and actual merits of trust in land use planning remain nebulous. What do participants of a local land use planning process actually mean when they say they trust the planning committee? How important is participants' trust in the planning committee in shaping their perceptions of the planning process and their cooperation in it? To explore the everyday meaning of trust in the specific context of local land use planning, semi-structured interviews with the participants of a local planning project in Switzerland were conducted (n = 9). Based on these results, the constitution and the relevance of trust in the responsible planning committee among a wider circle of participants were assessed (n = 66). The results show that participants trust the planning committee if they perceive its members as competent, honest, open, fair, reliable, reciprocating, respectful and committed. Interestingly, a considerable part of trust in the planning committee hinges explicitly on whether the committee incorporates the personal interests of the participant. Trust is indeed vital to participants' belief that a meaningful discussion and cooperation with the members of the planning committee is possible. However, trust is neither a guarantee for people's approval of planning decisions nor for their cooperation. One implication of the findings is that in order to evaluate trust-building practice comprehensively, it is necessary to first understand the specific everyday meaning of trust for 'real people' in real planning processes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is widely recognised that weak governance is a major constraint in planning for sustainable development, especially in the South. Sophisticated models that have been developed for assessing the likely effect of selected policies on land-use, and on sustainable development more generally, increasingly acknowledge this; but they do not include methods for taking this into account, in quantitative terms - which is what is necessary if such models are to be applied in practice. This paper begins by identifying the limitations of standard models in this respect, and then suggests a possible way to respond to the problem. We propose the use of what we call '. policy specific governance indicators', that is, indicators not of general government performance across the board, but rather of the actual performance of particular policies - or, if necessary, suitable proxies derived from similar policies. By reference to a case study from Brazil concerning controls on deforestation, we show how this can be done in practice, and built in to the planning model. And by reference to studies from Indonesia and India we explore how one might address still more challenging cases that may arise. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Segmentation, IKONOS, spectral quality, positional quality, Remote sensing With the launch of very high spatial resolution sensors, a good positional quality can be expected from spatial imagery. Furthermore, efficient segmentation algorithms can increase the productivity and reduce the subjectivity of manual delineation. However, segmentation algorithms rely on a combination of parameters. This study used two indices to assess the quality of a segmentation in a forested landscape for 32 parameter combinations. The study area was a forest of Southern Belgium covered by an IKONOS image. A manual delineation based on a 1 : 10 000 vector database was used for the validation. The segmentation algorithm from the eCognition software was used to produce the image objects. These image objects were then evaluated in terms of (1) positional accuracy and (2) feature consistency prior to classification. The positional quality assessment quantified the errors of location along the edges thanks to estimates of the positional accuracy and precision, that is bias and range of errors. Beside this, the consistency of object features was compared using a distance measure in a 6 dimensional feature space. The general tendency was an increased class-by-class discrimination and a lower edge precision when the scale parameter increased. Furthermore, when using a shape parameter, the compactness often improved the overall segmentation quality. However, the separation of deciduous and coniferous forests, which was the lowest of all classes, did not significantly increase with scale parameter. A small scale parameter seems therefore to be advisable.

AB  - Problem: Since the late 1980s, U.S. metropolitan regions have increasingly engaged in a style of land use-transportation scenario planning that merges techniques borrowed from military and business strategic planning with long-range transportation systems planning and project-level alternatives analysis. Aside from occasional anecdotal descriptions, the effectiveness of such approaches in generating compact growth plans has not been evaluated comprehensively. Purpose: We analyzed a wide range of scenario planning studies to determine how far compact growth scenarios are predicted to reduce vehicular travel below existing trends. Methods: Using hierarchical modeling, we developed a regional vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) model based on 85 scenarios in 23 planning studies from 18 metropolitan areas. Results and conclusions: Using coefficients from this model, we conservatively estimate that compact growth scenarios reduce VMT in 2050 by 17% below scenarios assuming a continuation of existing trends. Takeaway for practice: Existing transportation models remain largely insensitive to changes in land use and transportation policy. This must change for scenario planning to achieve its full potential. In the future, scenario planning should incorporate the best current knowledge about how global economic and environmental trends will affect regions.

AB  - This paper considers four contemporary challenges facing land use planning practice, and suggests that a new ethos for land use policy making is emerging. Informed by research into the modernisation of Scotland's planning system, it considers the wider implications for international planning debates. In particular, it addresses issues relating to ownership, legitimacy, and control of land use policy. Reviewing competing ideologies of planning practice, the paper argues that substantive reform has to be sensitive to political, economic, social, procedural, and cultural ideas around state intervention and the reconfiguration of public policy. The paper concludes that, whilst a neo-traditional structure of land use planning is being socially reconstructed, the competition between the underlying ideologies involved has been sharpened and accentuated. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Due to the northward migration of its industries to China, Hong Kong has lost its position as a major manufacturing centre in Asia. It has undergone rapid economic restructuring since the late 1980s and is transforming itself into a financial and service centre. Economic restructuring in Hong Kong is mainly due to the adoption of the 'open door' policy in China in 1978 which provided opportunities for Hong Kong manufacturers to establish plants in China. Not only has this had a major impact on the development of Hong Kong, it has also had an impact on urban planning. Urban planning has to deal with the decline of old urban districts, increased demand for industrial/office building, and changes in the locational demands of industries. It also has to provide the basic infrastructure to attract new types of industries and economic activities to face the challenge of the rapid decline in its traditional manufacturing base.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - This special issue consists of 10 papers that aim at deriving sustainability indicators based on the concept of socioeconomic metabolism. Its focus is on indicators that relate socioeconomic metabolism to land use. Six of the papers focus on methods to derive indicators. Of these, four examine approaches and applications of ecological footprints, one considers the 'material and energy flow accounting' toolbox that also includes human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), and another one considers an approach for comparing the sustainability of landscapes based on remotely sensed GIS data. Two papers focus on conceptual and theoretical issues that are common to a number of tools: one discusses basic conceptual issues of observing progress towards sustainability, whereas the other compares basic conceptual considerations and research questions driving HANPP on the one hand, and the ecological footprint on the other. Three papers present case studies, two on Austria and one compares three countries (Austria, South Korea and the Philippines) to the global level. One paper uses broad empirical datasets to test hypotheses on the relations between HANPP and landscape structure.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to simulate the location of land-use change, specifically forest disturbance, in Costa Rica over several decades. This paper presents a GIS-based model, GEOMOD2, which quantifies factors associated with land-use, and simulates the spatial pattern of land-use forward and backward in time. GEOMOD2 reads rasterized maps of land-use and other biogeophysical attributes to determine empirically the attributes of land that humans tend to use. Then GEOMOD2 uses the patterns of those biogeophysical attributes to simulate the spatial pattern of land-use change. GEOMOD2 can select locations for land-use change according to any of three decision rules based on (1) nearest neighbors, (2) stratification by political sub-region, and/or (3) the pattern of biogeophysical attributes. GEOMOD2 simulates the progressive loss of closed-canopy forest in Costa Rica for 1940, 1961 and 1983, which are the years for which maps of land-use are available. Also, GEOMOD2 extrapolates the pattern of land-use to the year 2010. When GEOMOD2 extrapolates land-use change over several decades, it is able to classify correctly between 74 and 88% of the grid cells, for two categories: forest versus non-forest. Over various simulation runs, Kappa ranges from 0.31 to 0.53. The model’s ability to predict the location of disturbance is best when the model is driven by the location of biogeophysical characteristics, most importantly lifezones.

AB  - In addition to a broad range of qualitative land development objectives, the German Federal Government has committed itself to reduce the growth of settlement and traffic areas from currently 113 ha (2004-2007) to 30 ha per day by 2020. In order to attain this ambitious quantitative goal, our paper presents a market-based policy of 'tradable planning permits'. This system would control land development by fixing the total amount of open space loss in a period with allocated planning permits, which can be traded between local jurisdictions. Since this approach is based on the cap-and-trade principle, we evaluate the transfer of traditional emission trading concepts to land-use control and explore regulatory options of potential systems: an undifferentiated permit system, a trading-ratio system and variations of zonal permit systems. We subject these alternative approaches to critical evaluation by using a variety of important criteria including efficiency gains, ecological effectiveness, hot spot formation and transaction costs. Finally, we summarize the potentials, limitations and risks of a permit trading system in general while reflecting the ongoing German debate on open space preservation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - NEV travel is rapidly increasing in the City of Lincoln. What was once considered a sleepy community has opened itself up to a tremendous opportunity for Smart Growth. This pilot NEV Transportation Plan will be an example to all cities in California. With, the expected population growth, aging citizens, and future residential development, the timing is ideal. Many positive impacts will make themselves present, such as the ability for residents to easily travel to local services, medical facilities, and commercial centers as the City's NEV-planned infrastructure development is fully implemented. Neighboring cities are working together to promote a network of safe routes for NEV travel. The NEV is a viable transportation alternative. The City plans to educate residents young and old about the benefits of driving NEVs. Families can use an NEV as a second vehicle for intracity travel and short trips, and high school/college students can use them to commute. The number of older Americans is expected to double over the next twenty-five years. Hopefully in the near future, the "restricted" driver's license program for the elderly will be codified and supported by all DMV offices. Within the text of AB 2353, Chapter 7 Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Transportation Plan, it states:"It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this chapter, to encourage discussions between the Legislature, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the California Highway Patrol regarding the adoption of a new classification for licensing motorists who use neighborhood electric vehicles." In accordance with the intent stated in AB 2353, it is recommended that the State of California expand the current restricted license program and establish an. NEV driver's license program. In addition, it is recommended that an incentive program be established to encourage drivers with physical challenges to exchange their automobile driver's license for an NEV driver's license. This program should be aimed at those who no longer feel comfortable driving in high-speed traffic. One retired highway patrolmen suggested a one to two-year automatic extension incentive when exchanging licenses. The need for mobility in an aging population makes this suggestion worth pursuing. The Cities of Lincoln and Rocklin are working toward nationwide uniformity of NEV Transportation Plan design elements. The trend of transportation using electric vehicles is catching on quickly. It is a tremendously desirable mode of transportation because it is good for the environment, economical, safe and fun. Transportation planning by local governments, in cooperation with the citizens in many communities, is proliferating throughout the nation. In the future, the standardization of signs, pavement markings, vehicle codes and design standards will assist with an efficient transition and modernization of roadways and infrastructure to allow for safe NEV travel.

AB  - Urban sustainable mobility solutions are being discussed throughout the world to deal with problems of high use of land, congestion situations, energy consumption and emissions derived from road transportation. Part of these solutions concerns the promotion of public transportation as an alternative to individual transportation. Public transport only becomes an attractive option if, for the mobility provided (passenger x km), emits less pollutants and consume less energy. This paper focuses on comparing the fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions (CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM) between urban Diesel buses (10 litres and 2.7 litres turbocharged Diesel) and typical gasoline and diesel European light duty vehicles (1.2 litres gasoline, 1.9 litres turbocharged Diesel). Results are analyzed as a function of transported passengers. For the proposed analysis, typical low traffic and congested traffic driving cycles were selected as an input to the EcoGest model, combined with driver behaviour characteristics and vehicle characteristics. Main results are easy-to-use charts highlighting where each mode is more attractive as a function of the number of passengers inside the bus and the number of people inside the vehicle. Results were obtained using EcoGest, a numerical model developed in our research institute. This model allows simulating the energetical and environmental performance of a road vehicle in a predefined route, accounting for the driving behaviour, vehicle specifications, powertrain specifications, occupation rate and road grade. The model has been used to simulate light duty and heavy duty vehicles, including gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen cars, and diesel and natural gas buses. Predicted results have been compared with measured fuel consumption and tail-pipe emissions in real-traffic situations, standard cycles (FTP75, NEDC), and predicted results of similar models (e.g. ADVISOR). Predictions of EcoGest are, usually, very good. Copyright ASCE 2008.

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

AB  - This paper is concerned with the relationship between the planning of settlements and health. It gives a brief introduction to the issues before summarising the evidence in relation to a range of topics, concluding with some more speculative thoughts on likely future findings. Modern planning was invented in response to inhumane living conditions in 19th century cities. But in the last century the connection was lost. Only now, with concerns over climate change and obesity, is there beginning to be the realisation that the physical environment is an important determinant of health. The paper uses a particular model of this relationship based on eco-system and health determinants theories to structure the review of evidence. The review covers: lifestyle choices in relation to physical activity and diet, mental well-being and community, the local economy and income, health inequalities and strategic land use transport planning, pollution and urban form, and finally impacts on global ecology. There is now a growing consensus that while personal factors are critical in determining health, the urban environment exacerbates or mitigates health and well-being outcomes. The level of active travel (walking and cycling) and outdoor recreational activity is strongly affected by accessibility to local facilities. Access to green, natural environments, and to local social networks, are factors in mental well-being. The wider sub-regional pattern of housing, economic development, land use and transport is a determinant of social exclusion and therefore health inequalities. It also affects health-damaging pollution, adaptability in the face of climate change and the level of carbon dioxide emissions. Wehave literally been building unhealthy conditions intomanyof our towns and cities. But comparisons with the best cities in Europe indicate that it is possible to reverse the less desirable trends. Success depends, however, on more radical policies of local authority control over land and finance than any political party has yet advocated. It also requires collaboration between the full range of powerful public and private organizations that influence the built environment. Future research is likely to further strengthen these conclusions. It will become much more obvious that planning for health and well-being is not only the NHS, but about creating a health-promoting physical, social and economic environment.
