AB  - In Urban Sprawl and Public Health, Howard Frumkin, Lawrence Frank, and Richard Jackson, three of the nation's leading public health and urban planning experts explore an intriguing question: How does the physical environment in which we live affect our health? For decades, growth and development in our communities has been of the low-density, automobile-dependent type known as sprawl. The authors examine the direct and indirect impacts of sprawl on human health and well-being, and discuss the prospects for improving public health through alternative approaches to design, land use, and transportation.Urban Sprawl and Public Health offers a comprehensive look at the interface of urban planning, architecture, transportation, community design, and public health. It summarizes the evidence linking adverse health outcomes with sprawling development, and outlines the complex challenges of developing policy that promotes and protects public health. Anyone concerned with issues of public health, urban planning, transportation, architecture, or the environment will want to read Urban Sprawl and Public Health.

AB  - The control of urban sprawl is one of the key issues challenging planners in many countries. Whilst a substantial discourse has developed in North America, it is also a matter of key concern for British and European planners, although here the debate is often expressed in terms of urban containment and the search for compact cities. This article considers the development of policies for the control of urban sprawl within the British planning system and examines their implementation and effectiveness within one city region: the Liverpool conurbation. Despite the considerable achievements of British policy in controlling urban sprawl and encouraging urban regeneration over the last two decades, there remain some doubts as to how much further market forces can be directed towards the production of more compact cities. In particular, a number of commentators, notably Breheny [Urban compaction: feasible and acceptable? Cities 14 (1997) 209-217], have raised doubts about the feasibility and acceptability of urban compaction to populations whose main housing location aspiration is for suburban living. Evidence in this paper is drawn from the analysis of secondary data for the Liverpool conurbation as well as the results of surveys of recently moving households carried out by the authors. This evidence suggests that despite recent progress, these market forces continue to represent a major challenge to policy makers in promoting the compact city. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Various authors, most notably Putnam (2000), have argued that low-density living reduces social capital and thus social interaction, and this argument has been used to buttress criticisms of urban sprawl. If low densities in fact reduce social interaction, then an externality arises, validating Putnam's critique. In choosing their own lot sizes, consumers would fail to consider the loss of interaction benefits for their neighbors when lot size is increased. Lot sizes would then be inefficiently large, and cities excessively spread out. The paper tests the premise of this argument (the existence of a positive link between interaction and density) using data from the Social Capital Benchmark Survey. In the empirical work, social interaction measures for individual survey respondents are regressed on census-tract density and a host of household characteristics, using an instrumental-variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of density.

AB  - One of the principle criticisms of urban sprawl is that it undermines the cost-effective provision of public services. In this paper the authors examine whether or not this is true through an exploratory analysis of the influence that alternative development patterns have on twelve meas- ures of public expenditure: total direct, capital facilities, roadways, other transportation, sewerage, trash collection, housing and community development, police protection, fire protection, parks, education, and libraries. The objectives of the analysis are threefold. First, the authors, through a background discussion, provide a brief overview of previous research on the relationship between urban development patterns and the cost of public services. Second, through empirical analysis, they examine how the character of urban development affects per capita public outlays in a cross-section of 283 metropolitan counties during the 1982 ^ 92 time period. A separate equation is estimated for each measure of expenditure, providing substantive evidence on how density, the spatial extent of urbanized land area, property value, and political fragmentation affect the cost of services. Finally, the authors use the results of the empirical analysis to develop a set of policy recommendations and directions for future research.

AB  - Both in Europe and North America there is a growing concern about the development of urban form, especially deconcentration of urban land use in the form of urban sprawl. This has unintentional consequences such as city centre decline, increased reliance on the use of the private car, and the loss of open space. While governments try to regulate the development of urban form, there are no easy solutions. However, policies such as ‘new urbanism’ and ‘smart growth’ in North America, and ‘compact city’ and ‘multifunctional land use’ policies in Europe, though difficult to implement, have the potential to curb urban sprawl and the further growth in car use, as the cases of Portland, Oregon and Randstad Holland in The Netherlands illustrate.

AB  - Urban sprawl features rapid geographic expansion of metropolitan areas in a “leapfrog,” low density pattern, segregation of distinct land uses, heavy dependence on automobile travel with extensive road construction, architectural and social homogeneity, shift of capital investment and economic opportunity from the city center to the periphery, and relatively weak regional planning. The economic, environmental, and social costs of sprawl have been widely debated, but the health implications have received less attention. This paper reviews direct and indirect impacts of urban sprawl on health. Some relate directly to the heavy reliance on automobiles: air pollution, automobile crashes, and pedestrian injuries and fatalities. Others relate to the land use patterns that typify sprawl: decreased physical activity, threats to water quantity and quality, and an expansion of the urban heat island effect. Finally, some health effects—mental health and social capital—are mediated by the social dimensions of sprawl. For each, the health effect and its connection with sprawl are identified, available evidence is reviewed, and issues requiring further research are noted. Inequities in the impact of sprawl are identified and discussed. Finally, some solutions are discussed.

AB  - Measuring urban sprawl is a controversial topic among scholars who investigate the urban landscape. This study attempts to measure sprawl from a landscape perspective. The measures and indices used are derived from various research disciplines, such as urban research, ecological research, and fractal geometry. The examination was based on an urban land-use survey performed in seventy-eight urban settlements in Israel over the course of fifteen years. Measures of sprawl were calculated at each settlement and were then weighted into one integrated sprawl index through factor analysis, thus enabling a description of sprawl rates and their dynamics over a time period of approximately two decades. The results reveal that urban sprawl is a multidimensional phenomenon that is best quantified by various measures.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - ABSTRACT This paper provides theoretical and empirical analyses of the effect of transportation subsidies on urban sprawl in a two-mode urban spatial model. Comparative static analysis shows, among other things, that the urban area contracts with a public transit subsidy but expands with an auto subsidy. The paper provides the first empirical test of these hypotheses and finds that the spatial size of the urbanized area shrinks with an increase in transit subsidies but increases at a decreasing rate with auto subsidies.

AB  - A study of the relationships between the amount of energy consumed for transportation purposes and a few selected variables related to urban form and socioeconomic characteristics of some of the largest Brazilian cities is conducted in this work. The studied cities include all 27 state capitals regardless of their size and population and 184 urban areas each with more than 20,000 inhabitants located in the state of S??o Paulo. Two different techniques were applied for data analyses: a more traditional regression analysis approach and artificial neural networks. In general, the results found in the analyses conducted here support the assumption that urban sprawl increases the energy use for transportation. In the case of the 27 state capitals, the analysis indicated that two spatial variables have a strong impact on the energy consumed for urban transportation: urban density and the ratio between the longest distances in the east-west and north-south directions. In the case of the 184 urbanized areas we also reached a similar conclusion. In that case, however, income and employment level apparently have a stronger influence on the amount of energy consumed. The results of the present study stress the importance of physical planning in developing country cities in order to reduce energy use for transportation. ?? 2007 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urban sprawl is a potential environmental influence on youth overweight/obesity. However, little is known about the association between urban sprawl and behaviours that influence obesity such as active transportation and physical activity.\n\nMETHODS: The study population consisted of 7,017 respondents aged 12 to 19 to the 2007/2008 Canadian Community Health Survey, living in Canada's 33 census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Factor analysis was used to obtain an urban sprawl score for each CMA, incorporating dwelling density, percentage of single or detached dwelling units, and percentage of the population living in the urban core. Multi-level logistic regression examined whether urban sprawl was associated with frequent active transportation (30 or more minutes a day), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (60 or more minutes a day), and overweight/obesity.\n\nRESULTS: Urban sprawl was associated with active transportation among 12- to 15-year-olds, with the relative odds of engaging in at least 30 minutes of active transportation per day increasing by 24% (95% CI: 10-39%) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in the urban sprawl score. For the entire sample aged 12 to 19, higher urban sprawl was associated with MVPA (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), but not with overweight/obesity (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.94-1.18).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Urban sprawl was associated with active transportation and MVPA in Canadian youth, although in the opposite direction to what has been reported in the literature for adults.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network.

AB  - There is some evidence to the effect that as cities become increasingly congested new housing starts occur at greater distances from urban centers while jobs tend to remain center-concentrated or develop in other suburbs. In either case, mean commute distances tend to increase. Telecommuting is seen as a means of increasing the jobs-housing balance in urban and suburban areas by enhancing the ability to move work to, or closer to, the workers' residences rather than requiring workers to commute to work daily. This has the immediate side effect of decreasing automobile congestion and associated energy consumption and air pollution. There is a possible longer term adverse impact of telecommuting resulting from its ability to decrease constraints on household location, thereby enhancing the rate of spread of suburbia. This paper reviews evidence concerning the possible effects of telecommuting on urban sprawl, as derived from a two-year test of telecommuting in California, and describes two scenarios of urban form development made more feasible by telecommuting.

AB  - This paper analyzes the effect of transport subsidies on the spatial expansion of cities, asking whether such subsidies are a source of undesirable urban sprawl. Even though the cost-reducing effect of transport subsidies is offset by a higher general tax burden (which reduces the demand for space), the analysis shows that subsidies nevertheless lead to spatial expansion of cities. If the transport system exhibits constant returns to scale, the subsidies are inefficient, making the urban expansion they entail undesirable. The paper also studies transport "system choice," with the city portrayed as selecting its transport system from along a continuum of money cost/time cost choices. The analysis shows that subsidies inefficiently bias choice in the direction of a high money cost/low time cost option. Lastly, the paper considers system choice in a city with rich and poor groups, showing that the rich favor a system with a high money cost and low time cost, but that their choice, if implemented, leads to a city whose spatial size is smaller than optimal. Thus, rich control of system choice does not lead to urban sprawl. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urban sprawl in France is a recent phenomenon, compared to the United States or the United Kingdom. The trend started after World War I and accelerated after World War II as indusries moved away from dense urban areas to settle in the close-in suburbs. In the 1970s, the process entered a second stage, with a boom in the relocation of both economic activities and housing to more distant places. Since then, the pace of growth in French inner cities slowed down, then declined absolutely, while population and employment rose in the first suburban ring and even more on the periphery. This evolution has recently led INSEE, the National Institute for Statistics, to design a new concept of 'Urban Areas` in order to assess more accurately the new scale of urban growth. This new tool has allowed a further analysis, both quantitative and qualitative, enablilng us to draw some prospective conclusions. In this analysis, we do not want to separate out population from employment because urban dynamism is closely linked to the rate of economic growth.

AB  - This article argues that urban spatial expansion results mainly from three powerful forces: a growing population, rising incomes, and falling commuting costs. Urban growth occurring purely in response to these fundamental forces cannot be faulted as socially undesirable, but three market failures may distort their operation, upsetting the allocation of land between agricultural and urban uses and justifying criticism of urban sprawl. These are the failure to account for the benefits of open space, excessive commuting because of a failure to account for the social costs of congestion, and failure to make new development pay for the infrastructure costs it generates. Precise remedies for these market failures are two types of development taxes and congestion tolls levied on commuters. Each of these remedies leads to a reduction in the spatial size of the city.

AB  - Various authors, most notably Putnam [Putnam, R.D., 2000. Bowling Alone. Simon and Schuster, New York], have argued that low-density living reduces social capital and thus social interaction, and this argument has been used to buttress criticisms of urban sprawl. If low densities in fact reduce social interaction, then an externality arises, validating Putnam's critique. In choosing their own lot sizes, consumers would fail to consider the loss of interaction benefits for their neighbors when lot size is increased. Lot sizes would then be inefficiently large, and cities excessively spread out. The paper tests the premise of this argument (the existence of a positive link between interaction and density) using data from the Social Capital Benchmark Survey. In the empirical work, social interaction measures for individual survey respondents are regressed on census-tract density and a host of household characteristics, using an instrumental-variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of density.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - In India, unprecedented population growth coupled with unplanned developmental activities has resulted in urbanization, which lack infrastructure facilities. This also has posed serious implications on the resource base of the region. The urbanization takes place either in radial direction around a well-established city or linearly along the highways. This dispersed development along highways, or surrounding the city and in rural countryside is often referred as sprawl. Some of the causes of the sprawl include – population growth, economy and proximity to resources and basic amenities. Patterns of infrastructure initiatives like the construction of roads and service facilities (such as hotels, tea shops, etc.) also often encourage the regional development, which eventually lead to urbanization. Identification and analyses of the patterns of sprawl in advance would help in effective infrastructure planning in urban area. In order to estimate and understand the behaviour of such urban sprawls, which is crucial for sound environmental planning and resource management, current study was undertaken along the Mangalore – Udupi National Highway (NH 17). The pattern of urban sprawl is identified and modeled using remotely sensed data. This helped in identifying the linear and radial pattern of growth and its rate. The analyses involved were land cover, land use, spatial and temporal changes and urbanization growth pattern recognition in a buffer zone of 4 km wide on either side of the highway. The spatial and temporal analyses techniques such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing are used to analyze and interpret the changes in the study region. The cadastral data comprises of the characteristics of land use / land cover, drainage network, roads and railway network and the administrative boundaries of 1972 from the toposheets of scale 1:50,000. Each character was digitized separately as vector layers. The remote sensing data was classified for land use, based on themes - built up, transportation (road and rail network), water bodies (sea, rivers, streams, etc.), agriculture and barren (uncultivable and waste land). For the change detection, temporal data between 1972 and 1999 (IRS platform) were used. This helped to identify the patterns of the change with respect to time. The entropy approach was applied for quantifying the urban sprawl. Modeling of the sprawl was done considering both spatial and statistical parameters - land use, built-up, watershed, transportation and population. Sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the causal factors and their growth rates. The population growth rate and population density increase, are based on the demographic data for the period 1951- 2001, which is incorporated in the Decision Support System. The decisions were based on various alternatives arising under a given set of criterion for a given objective. These also help to predict the sprawl in the subsequent years.

AB  - Much has been written in the post-World War II era in the United States about the rise of suburbia and development beyond older city boundaries, whether such development has been called urban, suburban, or ex-urban sprawl. Many writers have focused on various issues concerning sprawl, especially on the unintended consequences that new development has had on (among other issues) municipal finances, neighborhood income and residential segregation, and transportation planning. This last one is important since post-World War II development has mostly centered around the automobile in the United States. Over the last decade, a new area in the literature of sprawl has focused on how the "built-environment" of residential areas can impact health. For example, authors have chronicled how sprawled regions have higher auto vehicle accidents per capita, greater obesity rates, worse carbon emissions (due to greater travel by automobile), and delays in emergency medical service responses. This article adds to the latest set of papers on sprawl by empirically estimating the impact of sprawl in metropolitan regions on fire incidents per capita, firefighter response times, as well as property losses, and deaths due to fire. The results of our exploratory analysis indicate that urban sprawl is an important factor in influencing firefighting issues and outcomes in the United States, Moreover, urban sprawl frequently becomes a factor in delayed response to fires which, in turn, could lead to additional deaths and property loss.

AB  - ‘Urban sprawl’ is a term used to indicate low-density, discontinuous, automobile-dependent and inadequately planned urban development. Usually used in a pejorative sense, but never clearly defined, it has recently become a major political issue in a number of countries throughout the world. Sprawl, according to reformers, is inefficient because low-density settlements are costly to build and to service. Sprawl is considered to be inequitable, particularly in the United States, because it diverts resources away from central areas toward new settlements on the periphery. It is said to be environmentally damaging because it supposedly requires more energy use and produces more pollution than compact settlement. It is alleged to be damaging to community because it works against diversity. Finally, according to reformers, it is ugly. The solutions advanced by reformers to curb sprawl include growth boundaries, greenbelts, open space conservation measures, increased use of public transit, and more regional planning. Both the sprawl diagnosis and the remedies proposed to combat it are highly controversial, however, and, despite major efforts to limit it, sprawling development is seen increasingly in cities worldwide.

AB  - A theoretical model of farmland valuation is developed to explicitly account for three effects of urban sprawl: conversion of farmland to urban uses, effect on agricultural returns, and speculative effect as represented by farmland conversion risk. This model is estimated using county-level data in the continental United States. Evidence is found for all three effects of urban sprawl on farmland values. Counties more accessible to major urban centers have higher net agricultural returns. Subsidiary evidence supports that the latter effect may be attributed to survival of (or conversion to) high-valued agriculture around urban centers.

Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - A criticism of urban sprawl is that it is inefficient because it generates low-density development. This paper argues that an unconstrained urban land market with discontinuous development promotes higher-density development. The relationship between discontinuous development and density is tested on data from Dallas, Texas, and Montgomery and Fairfax Counties outside Washington, D.C. Regression results indicate all increasing in density over time. The relationship between density and accessibility, however, is more ambiguous. The results indicate that in Fairfax County, which imposes fewer density constraints on developers than Montgomery County, land initially skipped over is ultimately developed at higher density.

AB  -  This paper deals with an Agent-based Model of a Decision-Support System for an Urban Transport Network. The present Multi-Agent Decision-Support System (MADSS) assists the regulator in the search of the appropriate regulation decisions in case of a bus traffic disturbance. It is composed of a Supervision Module and a Regulation Module that rely on the information given by the Automatic Vehicle Monitoring system (AVM). The supervision Module represents the temporal axis of the network by the agents of type BUS and the spatial axis by the agents STOP. These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach. Hence, through the cooperative aspects of the agent interactions, the MADSS is able to perform a coherent and preventive regulation process.

The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities.

AB  - During the 1990s, the phenomenon of ur- ban sprawl received growing attention in the international planning debate. How- ever, a survey of the literature yields no agreement in terms of defining and measuring urban sprawl. The absence of a common understanding constrains the analysis of sprawl’s causes, costs and consequences, as well as the formulation of planning strategies towards economi- cally, ecologically and socially acceptable land use patterns. Politicians and plan- ners aiming to contain sprawl must agree upon a definition and a method for meas- uring progress in order to track their progress. This paper is intended to im- prove the understanding of causes, char- acteristics and effects of sprawl-type land use development, based on an overview of the international literature. In the first part, it gives a synthesis of sprawl defini- tions and measurement concepts. The second part outlines the dispute on causes and costs of urban sprawl and re- flects possible empirical influences. Fi- nally, a methodological framework for the measurement and assessment of land use patterns and dynamics is presented. This empirical approach operates with four general types of land use indicators able to depict the multiple dimensions of urban sprawl. 1. Hintergrund «Urban sprawl is like pornog

Although there is considerable evidence that urban sprawl has adverse affects on public health and the environment, policy frameworks designed to combat sprawl-such as smart growth-have proven to be controversial, making implementation difficult. Smart growth has generated considerable controversy because stakeholders affected by urban planning policies have conflicting interests and divergent moral and political viewpoints. In some of these situations, deliberative democracy-an approach to resolving controversial public-policy questions that emphasizes open, deliberative debate among the affected parties as an alternative to voting-would be a fair and effective way to resolve urban-planning issues.

AB  - Urban sprawl, once thought of as just an environmental issue, is currently gaining momentum as an emerging public health issue worthy of research and political attention. Characteristics seen in sprawling communities include increasing traffic volumes; inadequate public transportation; pedestrian unfriendly streets; and the division of businesses, shops, and homes. These characteristics can affect health in many ways. Greater air pollution contributes to higher asthma and other lung disorder rates. An increased dependence on the automobile encourages a more sedentary lifestyle and can potentially contribute to obesity. The increased danger and stress of long commutes can lead to more accidents, anxiety, and social isolation. Occupational health nurses can become involved by promoting physical activity in the workplace, creating programs for injury prevention and stress management, becoming involved in political smart growth measures, and educating and encouraging colleagues to become active in addressing this issue.

AB  - Urban sprawl beginning in the developed countries around 1950 is currently experienced in almost all countries. Many studies on the effects of urban sprawl indicate the emergence of harmful effects of this phenomenon. One of the most important environmental effects is the changes in climate. The purpose of this research was to identify the relation between urban sprawl components of Tehran with changes in climate variables. To this end, two data sets have been used to study the relation between these elements and components. The first data set included climatic elements such as rainfall, temperature, the percent of relative humidity and the percent of calm wind, as well as its mean speed for a period of 54 years (1953-2006). The second set of data was formed by components relevant to urban sprawl such as city area, private cars per capita, population density and number of urban population. Pearson correlation and multiple regression methods have been applied to compare and identify the relation between climatic components with urban sprawl indices. Results of correlation indicate that among the 5 aforementioned climatic components, annual rainfall and the mean of wind speed do not appear to have significant relation with sprawl, but the oscillations in percent of relative humidity and percent of calm wind seem to have a significant relation with Tehran sprawl. Consequently and using multivariate regression, it was concluded that the most important factor in the increasing temperature of Tehran, is the number of cars; the most important factor in increasing the percent of relative humidity is the area of Tehran, whereas the increase of the percent of calm wind may be attributed to the increase of population.

The foundation of the algorithm is that an actual road network has its particular spatial distribution features, and GIS has strong visual editing functions for transportation network. According to the size of the transportation network, with the GIS platform SuperMap, we partition the network into a certain amount of rectangular blocks, and then according to the starting node and the destination node, the searching area of the algorithm is restricted reasonably. With the actual example given, the experimental results prove the high operational efficiency and strong practicality of the new algorithm.

AB  - This paper discusses the issue of urban sprawl in the U.S. Urban sprawl can take different forms. It may involve low-density residential developments or so-called edge cities that give rise to business activity like office buildings, retail and even manufacturing. Only slightly more than 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in urban areas in 1790, a figure that had tripled by 1850 and surpassed 50 percent by 1920. In this view, the advent of the automobile and accompanying lower transportation costs became the primary catalyst of sprawling cities through much of the twentieth century. By 1910, the number of registered automobiles in the U.S. had passed the 500,000 mark, and in 1920, car registration reached eight million. The monocentric city model also suggests that rising incomes have led to decreasing city densities to the extent that the income elasticity of demand for housing and land is sufficiently large relative to the income elasticity of commuting costs. In principle, sprawl may both aggravate and lessen racial segregation within urban areas. In cities with little public transportation, this spatial mismatch may suppress employment opportunities for the poor who do not have access to the transportation technologies that drive the sprawling of cities and jobs.

The urban perimeters of mu- nicipalities have been used increasingly in favor agents of the reproduction of unequal urban space, aggravating the process of socio-spatial segregation, the formation of urban gaps and real estate speculation. Inherent to this process, infrastructure, one of the most important components of urban land and one of the most costly for local governments, has become increasingly dispersed and obsolete in the midst of the disordered occupation of the city’s land. Based on the above, this paper aims to analyze the phenomenon of urban sprawl in the city of Londrina by means of geotech- nologies and to identify the impacts that the form of land occupation the city has employed may cause on the current and future scenario of the municipality in general. To this end, thematic maps were drawn up from multiple sources, which, allied to a review of the literature, indicate that the municipality of Londrina exhibits intense characteristics of the phenomenon of urban sprawl, leading to consequences for territorial ordering and the egalitarian spatial distribution of essential services to the population.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6 % (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5 %. Introduction

AB  - Debates on the urban form have become strongly polarized between the advocates and opponents of the compact and of the dispersed or “sprawled” city. In this paper we argue that this may be the result of an excessive concentration on the study of the American experience and the neglect of other urban contexts, and examine the recent process of urban growth against the background of urban compactness and extreme densification represented by the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). The comparison of two detailed land-cover maps of 1993 and 2000 shows a progressive transformation in the traditional urban character of the region. Lower urban densities, high losses of non-urban land covers, depopulation of the metropolitan inner core, an increasing importance of single housing or the expansion of transportation infrastructures confirm the generalization of the dispersed urban model. However, the presence of numerous medium sized towns has also proved to be a deterrent of excessive dispersion. In conclusion, polycentric metropolitan areas such as the BMR may be more adjusted to absorb the negative effects of dispersion than monocentric areas.

AB  - This paper explores the connection between the property tax and urban sprawl. While the tax's depressing effect on improvements reduces population density, spurring the spatial expansion of cities, a countervailing effect from lower dwelling sizes may dominate, raising densities and making cities smaller. The analysis shows that this latter outcome is guaranteed under CES preferences when the elasticity of substitution Ïƒ is high. But numerical results for the Leontief case (where Ïƒ is zero) suggest that the property tax encourages urban sprawl when substitution between housing and other goods is low. Thus, the distortions generated by the property tax may include inefficient spatial expansion of cities, suggesting the tax may belong on the list of causal factors identified by critics of urban sprawl.

AB  - Assessment of the environmental impact of urban sprawl being understood here as the conversion of non-urban to urban land is still a subject for debate. Another shortcoming of the current discourse on urban sprawl is that it largely fails to reflect the interconnection of environmental and socio-economic aspects. In presenting a case study on the German city of Leipzig and applying the conceptual framework of driving forces, pressure, state, impact, and response (DPSIR-concept), this paper strives to assess the impact of urban sprawl on water balance and explores the repercussions of this impact upon the causation of and policies on urban sprawl. The study establishes that urban sprawl and related surface sealing have considerable impact on water fluxes and the urban water balance that may become imminent in the longer run. However, the study also shows that societal reactions on urban sprawl, first of all the attempts of both authorities and public initiatives to contain sprawl, are hardly motivated or influenced by concerns about environmental problems in a particular place (affected by urban sprawl). These attempts are mainly carried out on a national and regional level and reflect a general orientation in environmental politics rather than the desire to respond to individual urban developments. The study thus shows that the environmental impact of sprawl elicits only indirect repercussions in society.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - Various authors, most notably Putnam [Putnam, R.D., 2000. Bowling Alone. Simon and Schuster, New York], have argued that low-density living reduces social capital and thus social interaction, and this argument has been used to buttress criticisms of urban sprawl. If low densities in fact reduce social interaction, then an externality arises, validating Putnam's critique. In choosing their own lot sizes, consumers would fail to consider the loss of interaction benefits for their neighbors when lot size is increased. Lot sizes would then be inefficiently large, and cities excessively spread out. The paper tests the premise of this argument (the existence of a positive link between interaction and density) using data from the Social Capital Benchmark Survey. In the empirical work, social interaction measures for individual survey respondents are regressed on census-tract density and a host of household characteristics, using an instrumental-variable approach to control for the potential endogeneity of density.

Previous research contends that sprawl contributes to reducing the Black?White housing consumption gap by increasing the supply of land in housing markets and thereby increasing affordability. Antisprawl policies may therefore exacerbate the Black?White housing disparity. This research makes two contributions to the literature. First, the article examines how changes in sprawl may have varying influences on the Black?White housing gap, a previously unexamined facet of this relationship. In the vast majority of metropolitan areas in this sample, sprawl is predicted to exacerbate the Black?White housing gap until sprawl reaches a threshold. Only in a limited number of high-sprawl metropolitan areas does sprawl contribute to reducing the Black?White housing gap. Second, the article examines differences in housing gaps for three distinct minority groups?Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics?using recent data from the 2009 American Housing Survey. For Blacks, sprawl continues to have varying effects on housing consumption. For Asians, urban sprawl yields significant gains in housing consumption relative to Whites. However, no significant results occur for Hispanics. This article demonstrates that the independent effect of urban sprawl on U.S. minority housing consumption is a highly uneven process in the post?Great Recession economy. As such, arguments that antisprawl policies reduce minority gains in housing should be treated with considerable skepticism.\nThis article investigates the effect of urban sprawl, as measured by employment decentralization, on minority housing consumption gaps since the housing bust.

AB  - This paper discusses the issue of urban sprawl in the U.S. Urban sprawl can take different forms. It may involve low-density residential developments or so-called edge cities that give rise to business activity like office buildings, retail and even manufacturing. Only slightly more than 5 percent of the U.S. population lived in urban areas in 1790, a figure that had tripled by 1850 and surpassed 50 percent by 1920. In this view, the advent of the automobile and accompanying lower transportation costs became the primary catalyst of sprawling cities through much of the twentieth century. By 1910, the number of registered automobiles in the U.S. had passed the 500,000 mark, and in 1920, car registration reached eight million. The monocentric city model also suggests that rising incomes have led to decreasing city densities to the extent that the income elasticity of demand for housing and land is sufficiently large relative to the income elasticity of commuting costs. In principle, sprawl may both aggravate and lessen racial segregation within urban areas. In cities with little public transportation, this spatial mismatch may suppress employment opportunities for the poor who do not have access to the transportation technologies that drive the sprawling of cities and jobs.

AB  - Travel can affect land use just as land use affects travel behaviour of people. Low-cost travel, especially resulting from transportation improvements since the nineteenth century, has resulted in long-distance travel and urban sprawl, bringing along negative aspects such as traffic congestion and air pollution, but also reductions in biodiversity and public health. In order to try to partly reverse this process, the supply of infrastructure and public transportation can no longer follow the demand of transportation; the supply has to steer the demand. Infrastructure and high-quality public transportation should be clustered in and between large and regional cities. Increasing travel costs for car use (e.g., road pricing) can positively affect travel distances and travel mode choice, but also long-term decisions such as the residential location choice, stimulating compact, mixed-use developments. In this paper, we focus on Flanders, Belgium, a region where mobility policies stimulated long-distance travel and limited land use regulations did not hinder urban sprawl. Increasing travel costs combined with a more active spatial planning policy and a stronger cooperation between mobility policy and spatial planning can help to decrease car use and urban sprawl, but also change the way in which people perceive travel. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper implements a land use classification for the City of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, using an object-oriented approach for six Landsat TM and ETM+ images and simulates the land use pattern in the future using Markov Chain analysis and Cellular Automata analysis based on the interactions between these land uses and the transportation network. Shannon's Entropy (an urban sprawl index) based on the land use classification results is used to measure urban sprawl. This research proves that an object-oriented approach can produce satisfactory classification results. It reveals the manner in which land use is likely to develop in the future, and demonstrates that urban sprawl continued to grow in Calgary during the years between 1985 and 2001. Such models are useful for providing the building blocks for traditional four-step transportation planning models. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Rapid increase of urban sprawl in many countries worldwide has become a major concern because of its detrimental effects on the environment. Existing measures of urban sprawl suffer from a confusing variety of differing, and sometimes contradictory, interpretations of the term "urban sprawl". Therefore, results from different studies cannot usually be compared to each other and are difficult to interpret consistently. Every meaningful method to measure the degree of urban sprawl needs to be based on a clear definition of "urban sprawl" disentangling causes and consequences of urban sprawl from the phenomenon of urban sprawl itself, as urban sprawl has differing causes and consequences in different regions and regulatory contexts. This paper contributes to the development of more reliable measures of urban sprawl by providing clarifications to the definition of "urban sprawl" and by developing a set of 13 suitability criteria for measures of urban sprawl. Our study proceeds in three steps. First, it proposes a clear definition of urban sprawl that is based on an evaluation of existing urban sprawl definitions. Second, it derives from this definition 13 suitability criteria for measures of urban sprawl. These criteria are useful to systematically evaluate the consistency and reliability of existing and future metrics of urban sprawl. The 13 criteria include (1) intuitive interpretation, (2) mathematical simplicity, (3) modest data requirements, (4) low sensitivity to very small patches of urban area, (5) monotonous response to increases in urban area, (6) monotonous response to increasing distance between two urban patches when within the scale of analysis, (7) monotonous response to increased spreading of three urban patches, (8) same direction of the metric's responses to the processes in criteria 5, 6 and 7, (9) continuous response to the merging of two urban patches, (10) independence of the metric from the location of the pattern of urban patches within the reporting unit, (11) continuous response to increasing distance between two urban patches when they move beyond the scale of analysis, (12) mathematical homogeneity (i.e., intensive or extensive measure), and (13) additivity (i.e., additive or area-proportionately additive measure). Third, we illustrate the application of the 13 criteria by systematically assessing three existing measures of urban sprawl. We conclude that suitability criteria help understand the behavior of metrics intended to measure urban sprawl and to identify the most suitable measures.

AB  - This paper studies the determinants of urban sprawl in France using panel datasets for the four largest metropolitan areas (Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Lille) over the period 1985–98. A measure of urban sprawl is proposed at municipality level. Due to the huge heterogeneity of the panels, it seems difficult to make the fundamental homogeneity assumption underlying pooled models. Thus, random coefficient models under heteroscedasticity of the disturbances are estimated for each metropolitan area using a hierarchical Bayes approach based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation method. It is found that urban sprawl is positively related to the income growth of the tax payers’ fiscal households for the period of rapid growth in the late 1980s. At the opposite extreme, the income effects are negative for non-tax payers. During the recession, income effects are significant neither for tax payers’ nor for non-tax payers’ fiscal households and are significantly positive for tax payers and negative for non-tax payers over the recovery. Finally, on average, the inequality index—difference of average net income between tax payers and exempted fiscal households—has a lower impact on urban sprawl than the income effect.

AB  - North American cities have undergone dramatic changes over the last century. Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005–2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption.

AB  - This paper explores the connection between the property tax and urban sprawl. While the tax's depressing effect on improvements reduces population density, spurring the spatial expansion of cities, a countervailing effect from lower dwelling sizes may dominate, raising densities and making cities smaller. The analysis shows that this latter outcome is guaranteed under CES preferences when the elasticity of substitution sigma is high. But numerical results for the Leontief case (where sigma is zero) suggest that the property tax encourages urban sprawl when substitution between housing and other goods is low. Thus, the distortions generated by the property tax may include inefficient spatial expansion of cities, suggesting the tax may belong on the list of causal factors identified by critics of urban sprawl

AB  - Landsat TM, Urban Sprawl, Change Detection, Landscape Metrics, Environmental Impact Assessment This research investigates the extent of land cover change, particularly urban sprawl, in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and the nature of the resulting landscape fragmentation, particularly with regard to the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM), an ecologically important and sensitive area for the region. Three scenes of Landsat TM imagery were acquired from July/August 1985, July/August 1995 and July 2005. The TM images and TM5 textures were classified into seven land cover categories, i.e., low-density built-up, high-density built-up, construction sites, agriculture, forest, golf courses, parks/pasture and water using a maximum likelihood classifier. The overall accuracies were 90% for 1985, 93% for 1995 and 91% for 2005. Landscape fragmentation due to spatio-temporal changes was then evaluated using spatial metrics.The landscape composition results indicate that significant urban growth and sprawl occurred in the GTA. Comparison of the land cover classes over the 20 year period reveals a shift in dominance in the landscape through a clear increase in low-density built-up land cover categories coupled with a clear decrease in agricultural areas. The landscape configuration metrics calculated suggest increased fragmentation of both agricultural and low-density built-up areas during the two decades. Combined with the change in their proportions, this meant more isolation and attrition for the former, while the latter gained area through the appearance of more frequent and relatively smaller patches. In addition, the contagion and proximity indices indicate that agricultural areas were increasingly reduced in area, subdivided into smaller patches and became more dispersed over the given time period, while the opposite was true of suburban areas. The most extensive urban expansion onto the ORM occurred in municipalities within the region of York and therefore a thorough investigation of the impacts of this expansion is strongly recommended.

AB  - Urban sprawl has become the catch phrase for everything that is bad about urban growth today–congestion, blight, monotony, endless development, and ecological destruction. Beneath the hoopla, however, is a serious debate about how to manage urban growth effectively. This paper provides a framework for decomposing sprawl into its component parts. The paper's objective is to distinguish those aspects associated with sprawl that are truly bad from those that are not. It identifies fourteen outcomes that are associated with or blamed on sprawl, and then discusses which ones are truly deleterious and which ones are not. The paper concludes that sprawl is a complex, multi-faceted problem requiring multi-faceted solutions.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - Across the nation, the debate over metropolitan sprawl and its impacts continues. A decade ago, Smart Growth America (SGA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sought to raise the level of the debate by sponsoring groundbreaking research to quantitatively measure sprawl and its quality-of-life impacts. The resulting measures have been widely used in urban research. In this study for the National Cancer Institute, the Brookings Institution, and Smart Growth America, we begin in Chapter 1 by reviewing the history of sprawl-related research and writing. Before 2000, attempts to characterize sprawl were mostly qualitative, subjective, and often polemical. Sprawl was either very bad or very good, depending on the philosophical leaning of the author. After 2000, researchers began to measure sprawl objectively and rank places as more or less sprawling, first mostly in terms of density variables and later more completely as a multidimensional phenomenon. They also began to relate quantitative measures of sprawl to quality-of-life outcomes. In Chapter 2, we update the original county indices to 2010. As one would expect, the degree of county sprawl does not change dramatically over a 10-year period. Also, given their fixed boundaries, most counties become more compact (denser and with smaller blocks) over the 10-year period. Sprawl occurs mainly as previously rural counties (in 2000) outside metropolitan areas become low density suburbs and exurbs of metropolitan areas (in 2010). In Chapter 3, we develop refined versions of the indices that incorporate more measures of the built environment. The refined indices capture four distinct dimensions of sprawl, thereby characterizing county sprawl in all its complexity. The four are development density, land use mix, population and employment centering, and street accessibility. The dimensions of the new county indices parallel the metropolitan indices developed by Ewing et al. (2002), basically representing the relative accessibility provided by the county. The simple structure of the original county sprawl index has become more complex, but also more nuanced and comprehensive, in line with definitions of sprawl in the technical literature. In Chapters 4, 5, and 6, we validate our county indices against data on journey to work, traffic fatalities, and obesity, physical activity, and chronic diseases. Validation of the 2010 sprawl indices, both the original and refined indices and four individual factors, takes the same form as the original validation in 2003. As expected based on earlier research, we find that county sprawl is associated with lower walk and transit shares of commute trips, longer drive times, higher fatal crash rates, and higher incidence of obesity and certain chronic diseases. Other outcomes are not as clearly related to sprawl. In Chapter 7, we develop metropolitan sprawl indices that, like the refined county indices, have four distinct dimensions-- development density, land use mix, population and employment centering, and street accessibility. Compared to metropolitan sprawl indices from the early 2000s, these new indices incorporate more variables and hence have more construct validity. For example, the earlier effort defined density strictly in terms of population concentrations, while this effort considers employment concentrations as well. The reason for developing metropolitan sprawl indices, rather than limiting ourselves to counties, is that metropolitan areas are natural units of aggregation for certain analyses. In Chapter 8, we relate sprawl indices to three topics of recent popular interest, for which datasets have recently been released. The three are life expectancy, housing plus transportation costs, and upward economic mobility. We find that life expectancy is greater in compact areas, in part due to lower prevalence of obesity and lower vehicle miles traveled (which relates to traffic fatalities). Housing costs are higher in compact areas, but these higher costs are more than offset by lower transportation costs, and the net effect is a just barely significant relationship between compactness and overall housing affordability. In Chapter 9, we conduct one of the first longitudinal analysis of sprawl to see which areas are sprawling more over time, and which are sprawling less or actually becoming more compact. To conduct such as analysis, we need to employ a new level of geography, the census urbanized area. In contrast of counties and metropolitan areas, urbanized areas expand incrementally as areas grow and rural tracts are converted to urban and suburban uses. The analysis shows that, on average, urban sprawl in the U.S. increased between 2000 and 2010, but that there are many exceptions to this generalization. The appendices provide values of compactness/sprawl indices for counties, metropolitan areas, and urbanized areas. Data are available in electronic form at

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

It assumes that more telecommuting occurs when telecommuters' labor cost share increases and/or workers adopt a more favorable attitude toward working from home. The study shows that telecommuting produces opposing forces that regulate the city size, one centralizing and the other decentralizing urban activities. These forces are examined in a city where workers and firms are given the option to freely mix working at the office and at home, and the city's land use is endogenously determined. A rise in the productivity of an economy due to telecommunications technology could work to centralize urban activities, while urban contraction can occur with a fixed city population. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In India, unprecedented population growth coupled with unplanned developmental activities has resulted in urbanization, which lack infrastructure facilities. This also has posed serious implications on the resource base of the region. The urbanization takes place either in radial direction around a well-established city or linearly along the highways. This dispersed development along highways, or surrounding the city and in rural countryside is often referred as sprawl. Some of the causes of the sprawl include population growth, economy and proximity to resources and basic amenities. Patterns of infrastructure initiatives like the construction of roads and service facilities (such as hotels, tea shops, etc.) also often encourage the regional development, which eventually lead to urbanization. Identification and analyses of the patterns of sprawl in advance would help in effective infrastructure planning in urban area. In order to estimate and understand the behaviour of such urban sprawls, which is crucial for sound environmental planning and resource management, current study was undertaken along the Mangalore Udupi National Highway (NH 17). The pattern of urban sprawl is identified and modeled using remotely sensed data. This helped in identifying the linear and radial pattern of growth and its rate. The analyses involved were land cover, land use, spatial and temporal changes and urbanization growth pattern recognition in a buffer zone of 4 km wide on either side of the highway. The spatial and temporal analyses techniques such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing are used to analyze and interpret the changes in the study region. The cadastral data comprises of the characteristics of land use land cover, drainage network, roads and railway network and the administrative boundaries of 1972 from the toposheets of scale 1:50,000. Each character was digitized separately as vector layers. The remote sensing data was classified for land use, based on themes - built up, transportation (road and rail network), water bodies (sea, rivers, streams, etc.), agriculture and barren (uncultivable and waste land). For the change detection, temporal data between 1972 and 1999 (IRS platform) were used. This helped to identify the patterns of the change with respect to time. The entropy approach was applied for quantifying the urban sprawl. Modeling of the sprawl was done considering both spatial and statistical parameters - land use, built-up, watershed, transportation and population. Sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the causal factors and their growth rates. The population growth rate and population density increase, are based on the demographic data for the period 1951- 2001, which is incorporated in the Decision Support System. The decisions were based on various alternatives arising under a given set of criterion for a given objective. These also help to predict the sprawl in the subsequent years.

AB  - This paper aims at describing urban sprawl driven land use changes during the last decades in Greece as well as analyzing the major regional and economic development implications. Particular attention is given to the analysis of possible driving forces with economic and social origin that contribute to the sprawl of urban forms in the suburbs and into the countryside. We employ an ordinal regression model in order to investigate the likely driving factors of urban sprawl across NUTS-III municipalities in Greece. Ordinal regression is a variation of ordinary regression which is used when the dependent variable is categorical and the explanatory variables are continuous or categorical ones. The results of the empirical analysis bring up some important issues relevant to the theoretical framework of the study. The degrees of influence of the individual factors as well as their level of significance vary considerably. Accessibility, informal housing practices, direct population potential and the existence of coastal natural resources seem to fuel urban sprawl. Overall, we think that this empirical research can provide decision-makers with important information concerning the major factors which influence urban sprawl. In the context of planning a sustainable regional development policy the major driving factors and the spatial patterns generated by urban phenomena such as urban sprawl and illegal housing are of crucial importance. Urban sprawl phenomenon has hardly been analyzed at the regional level in Greece. Most existing studies focus on the periphery of great metropolitan areas. Yet, an overview of urban sprawl patterns at a broader scale can give valuable information on the basic trends of the phenomenon across the country and uncover certain spatial differences in the magnitude of sprawl between locations.

AB  - There is no commonly accepted definition of urban sprawl, and therefore applied research has worked with different indicators aiming to grasp the diverse meanings assigned to the term. This study measures how the dispersion of population and employment in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR) developed between 1986 and 2001. The dimensions that were investigated are divided into two groups. The first one involves dimensions of urban form (decentralization, low density and discontinuity), and the second, of urban structure. As opposed to some studies, where polycentrism and linear growth are presented as two forms of sprawl, in our case we contrast the idea of structured urban expansion (linear or poly-centric) with de structured urban expansion (amorphous, chaotic or random), identifying the latter with the fourth dimension of sprawl. The results suggest that population and employment in the BMR has become decentralized in a non-concentrated way and, in the case of population, the density has decreased. However, the BMR has not grown in a discontinuous or de-structured way, but quite the contrary. © EURE.

AB  - The diffusion of urban development results in higher emissions of global warming gases, especially carbon dioxide, because urban sprawl results in higher energy use in transportation and the heating and cooling of spacious homes on the urban periphery. The techniques and politics underlying the diffuse urban form were pioneered in the United States in the late nineteenth century, where landowners and developers sought to use mechanised forms of transportation to increase the value of their land holdings. Today, leading international business organisations seeking to curb anthropogenic climate change gases do not attempt to reform sprawled urban landscapes, but instead promote technological reforms that would allow sprawl to continue. This is because urban sprawl pushes up demand for such consumer durables as automobiles and household appliances. In this article the author describes how the techniques of urban sprawl were developed and championed politically by landholders and developers in the US. The author also describes the perils and limits in relying on technology to abate anthropogenic climate change gases.

AB  - This paper shows the similarity between transportation networks and thermodynamic systems. In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesize that farmers transition from low-value, land-intensive \traditional" crops to high-value, labor-intensive \specialized" crops on parcels located closer to urban centers. Once returns

AB  - Urban sprawl must be distinguished from urban expansion in general, and scattered development must be seen as a particular form of sprawl. The key variables here, writes McGill University professor Raphaël Fischler, are density and urban form. The growth of low-density, car-orientated environments around cities is largely a response to individual demand but also a source of collective problems, some of which are yet to come. The extent to which sprawl constitutes a public-policy problem depends on the values we bring to bear on the issue and on the constituency that is affected.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

AB  - The distribution of citations of five path-breaking publications across regional science and transportation journals is examined to gauge whether RSUE was a significant player in the evolution of urban transportation network modeling research. Concluding this research area is pertinent to the journal, and research advances in transportation network equilibrium modeling are traced through five phases of development from its beginnings in the early 1950s. Then, the future of this research area is examined with regard to four issues: representation of congestion; tour-based representation of travel; non-separable travel time-flow relationships; and dynamic network flows.

AB  - This paper examines changes in urban sprawl in United States metropolitan areas from 1970 to 2010 using a sprawl measure based on the proportional differences in population percentages between high density and low density tracts. During the past four decades, sprawl has increased, but the rate of increase has dramatically decelerated since the 1970s. Considering individual metropolitan areas, there are several different sprawl histories. Some metros continue to have high rates of sprawl increases, others (the majority) have settled into steady state or modestly changing levels of sprawl, and others have a history of densification. Regression analysis shows that 1970 sprawl levels, western location, median household income, center city population change, African American and Hispanic population percentages, southern location and percent of the workforce employed in manufacturing were associated with changes between 1970 and 2010 sprawl levels. These divergent trajectories, along with a closer examination of sprawl in individual metropolitan areas, suggest sprawl may be neither inevitable nor irreversible.

AB  - Sprawling urban development is one of the major issues that mainly refer to the extent of urbanization. Less urban sprawl and more compact residential development have been viewed as important components of the environmental agenda. In the major cities of developing countries like Istanbul, where the population is over 12 millions, urban sprawl threatens the natural resources through large-scale land consumption. Thus, many policy-makers are starting to look for ways to control sprawl through smart growth policies before it becomes unmanageable. Urban planners require information related to the rate of growth, pattern and extent of sprawl to provide basic measurements for planning strategies. The aim of this research is to provide a sprawl measurement methodology that contributes to the understanding of sprawl dynamics. Using geographic information systems and spatial data, it is possible to identify the pattern of urban sprawl. This paper presents the extent of urban sprawl in Istanbul over six periods from 1975 to 2005. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The effect of urban expansion on transportation in growing megacities has become a key issue in the context of global climate change as motorized mobility is a major source of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. The management of forms of urban development on the city fringe in order to encourage a sustainable transport system is usually overlooked in China, although it is increasingly attracting attention in developed countries. Examining the case of Beijing, this paper aims to reveal the policy implications of urban growth management for sustainable transportation in China's megacities. The analysis shows that in the rapid urban expansion process there has been obvious urban sprawl on the fringe of Beijing, characterized by low density and dispersed development in its physical aspect and a low degree of local mixed land use in its functional aspect. Trip distance and car use for travel on the city fringe have increased greatly due to urban sprawl. The results of the analysis suggest that urban growth management designed to curb urban sprawl would contribute to containing the growth in vehicle miles travelled in the suburbs. In addition, since urban sprawl has been greatly fuelled by increasing local government autonomy and fiscal responsibility, the negative effects of sprawling development on transportation certainly reflect the government's failure to manage growth in the current transformation process. To achieve sustainable urban expansion, stronger metropolitan development management measures should be enforced to control local development on the city fringe and promote sustainable transportation. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Must the strip mall and the eight-lane highway define 21st century American life? That is a central question posed by critics of suburban and exurban living in America. Yet despite the ubiquity of the critique, it never sticks--Americans by the scores of millions have willingly moved into sprawling developments over the past few decades. Americans find many of the more substantial criticisms of sprawl easy to ignore because they often come across as snobbish in tone. Yet as Thad Williamson explains, sprawl does create real, measurable social problems. Williamson's work is unique in two important ways. First, while he highlights the deleterious effects of sprawl on civic life in America, he is also evenhanded. He does not dismiss the pastoral, homeowning ideal that is at the root of sprawl, and is sympathetic to the vast numbers of Americans who very clearly prefer it. Secondly, his critique is neither aesthetic nor moralistic in tone, but based on social science. Utilizing a landmark 30,000-person survey, he shows that sprawl fosters civic disengagement, accentuates inequality, and negatively impacts the environment. Sprawl, Justice, and Citizenship will not only be the most comprehensive work in print on the subject, it will be the first to offer a empirically rigorous critique of the most popular form of living in America today.

AB  - Both in Europe and North America there is a growing concern about the development of urban form, especially deconcentration of urban land use in the form of urban sprawl. This has unintentional consequences such as city centre decline, increased reliance on the use of the private car, and the loss of open space. While governments try to regulate the development of urban form, there are no easy solutions. However, policies such as 'new urbanism' and 'smart growth' in North America, and 'compact city' and 'multifunctional land use' policies in Europe, though difficult to implement, have the potential to curb urban sprawl and the further growth in car use, as the cases of Portland, Oregon and Randstad Holland in The Netherlands illustrate.
