AB  - Examines the dominant pattern of spatial diffusion of nine entrepreneurial innovations in the Meiji and Taisho era with reference to the Japanese urban system. Factor analysis was applied to the adoption ranking matrix of the innovations for the selected 25 largest cities in 1903. Three types of diffusion patterns were identified linked to the castle town system, to population size and to the location of foreign trade port cities. These patterns reflect the constitution of the Japanese urban system developing after the Meiji era.-from Author

AB  - This paper examines the changing employment structure of 150 travel-to-work areas (TTWAs) in Britain from 1991 to 2001. Using data from the Annual Employment Survey and the Annual Business Inquiry, 20 sectors of economic activity are defined and investigated. The analysis clearly identifies the continued shift away front primary and manufacturing employment as increasingly more people are employed in the so-called service-based and informational economy. Clear spatial patterns emerge associated with employment change across sectors and these are also explored. Given the changing pattern of employment and the spatial characteristics of each sector, new patterns of specialization and diversification are expected to emerge. The analysis identifies these patterns and places their explanation into the context of changing technology and skills. It becomes clear that at in urban system level there is a weak convergent trend across urban system. However, when the largest places are examined separately, it is apparent that the largest urban areas in Britain appear to have employment structures that are divergent from the rest of the urban system. This highlights the changing roles played by larger cities in Britain and has obvious implications for local labour markets and policy in those places.

AB  - As the constrained conditions, the urban system of the host cities influence the Post-Games development of the Olympics' venues significantly. Based on the interactive mechanism between the urban system and the Olympics' venue projects, as well as the demand theory, this paper explores the main factors of the urban system are per capita GDP, population, ratio of the service industries of the urban system, which influence post-Games development of the Olympics' venues. Meanwhile, with the relevant statistic materials of the recent Games host cities in the Games year, applies two methods of ward cluster analysis and k-means cluster analysis to verify the validity of the three factors which influence post-Games development of the Olympics' venues. The Olympic Events hosted cities in China-Beijing, Hongkong, Qingdao and other cities are clustered with the recent Games host cities, and the differences are discussed. So conclusions are given that support of urban system of hosting the 2008 Olympic Games in China for the post-Games development of Olympicspsila venues is no strong, and the relevant strategies are introduced, such as attracting external consumption, improving the relative industries of the urban system, etc.

AB  - This paper illustrates the power of geography in solving spatial problems. We demonstrate how an urban system can be produced to meet spatial development objectives stated in Ghana?s nascent National Urban Policy. Even though the growth pole, functional, territorial and economy of affection approaches have been used to theorize the role of towns, we conceptualize the role of towns in the development process as arenas for providing services, infrastructure, livelihoods, housing, governance and environmental protection. Urban systems are therefore produced to meet development objectives which are often spelled out in development plans or societal imperatives. Based on our conceptualization of the role of towns, we identify the current functional structure of Ghana?s urban system. This is followed by a determination of functional gaps and weaknesses in the country?s urban system. We offer ways of filling the gaps and strengthening weaknesses in the country?s urban system in the light of objectives of the proposed NUP. We conclude the paper with general lessons for sub-Saharan African countries.

Following the major migrations that followed the end of World War II, the level of migration has declined, but remains significant.  They estimate that between 1971 and 1980, 10 million rural-urban migrants were added to the urban population.  Although this migration declined in importance after 1980, the major cities continue to attract migrants while smaller towns decline and the rural population ages.

AB  - Urban system is the spatial reflection of the inner-deep social economic movement. New economic circum- stances not only make the evolution of urban system present one brand-new landscape, but also put forward a new subject for planning of urban system. This article analyzes the properties of the traditional economic process and its essential ef- fect on urban system; it makes a complete survey on the properties of new economic circumstances and its effect on re-forming of urban system; the complicated influential process and result are concluded into the aspects, such as new growth motive force, new economic organization, new location factor and new spatial phenomenon, and its inner effect mechanism is shown as well. In this article, the change process of urban system space is explained in four aspects: ( 1 ) dissimulation in the process of spatial agglomeration and diffusion; (2) change of "center-periphery "effect; (3) accelera- tion growth of axial regions; (4) re-forming of the world and regional urban system. Based on the above theoretical analy- sis and the properties & requests of new economic circumstances, this article finally puts forward four philosophies empha- sized by urban system planning, and forms the new frame for drawing-up of urban system planning.

Urban centres have moved up and down the urban hierarchy, and the delineation of urban spheres of influence for the top levels of the urban hierarchy in 1966, 1971 and 1981 indicates that hinterlands have also changed. New centres in the upper tiers of the hierarchy developed in areas where the hinterlands of the older centres in that tier had previously converged. The analysis of such spheres of influences and urban attraction over time can be used as an important aid for a variety of types of government planning.

AB  - In recent years, Vancouver has become willy-nilly a receiving centre for the several thousand Indian people migrating out of reserves & towns of British Columbia (BC), the Prairie provinces, Ontario, & northwestern US. The diversity of peoples is great: they represent 200 bands from 1500 small reservations in BC alone. Many stay for weeks, months, or years & then move on to other cities, to Ru areas, back to Vancouver again. Although many come for employment, training & education, these attractions of Ur life are not necessarily the main impetus. The internal status structure, of the reserves, injured reputations, personal & family problems, or a sense of social isolation prod a large proportion of migrants to leave. The basis for their leaving in turn affects the strength of their social & kinship ties with the reserve & the fostering of tribal or ethnic networks in the city. Even without an organized relocation program in Canada, the residential schools, high school boarding & foster home programs, & jails pull young people away from their homes & into the greater Vancouver area. Once in the city, old & young must learn to cope with aspects of the Ur system in order to make a living from the resources available. Several avenues of adaptation are available, according to past experiences, expectations, & first hurdles. `Learning the ropes' may be accomplished in several ways; the city itself has many faces. For some, 'the city' consists of a 3 block radius: the complex organization, the comforting & challenging community of skid road. The Vancouver Friendship Centre & its affiliated group homes attract many veterans of skids as well as incoming migrants. Half-way houses, red power, an Indian free school & the youth movement are working to build an active, workable Indian identity in the city. Families, difficult to locate or to enumerate have found homes & jobs for themselves, & maintain Indian social contacts in the beer parlors which attract Indian clientele. Entry into Vancouver does not entail a rejection of Indian or Ru values nor a commitment to Ur life.

AB  - A survey of duck management systems was carried out in 5 locations in Basawa District of Sabon Gari Local Government Area in Kaduna State, Nigeria. Information collected via the questionnaires distributed revealed that the management system was free range. Two duck varieties were encountered, Muscovy and Mallard, with the former being more predominant. The mean flock size was 10.9±10.8 birds occurring in the ratio of one drake to six females. Egg laying was seasonal, commencing at the onset of rainy season. Estimates were obtained for some production parameters. Age at first lay was 7.7±0.44 months. Clutch size was not noted by any of the farmers. The average number of eggs per duck per season was 80.8±0.74, and the average selling prices of drakes, ducks, weaners, ducklings and eggs were 400±19.3, 281±0.37, 201±11.5, 101±3.70 and 12.2±0.74 naira, respectively. Mugwui and ectoparasites were identified as the major health problems. The survey showed that the present level of duck management system in Basawa District was free range with home attachment.\n

Central investments determined local spatial development. Economic reforms and administrative decentralization after 1978 allowed local authorities to pursue their own development, leading to many planning problems. To regain control over spatial development, the state now employs urban system planning to regulate development in city regions. The Pearl River Delta Urban System Plan (PRDUSP) is a case in point. To overcome myopic regional development and environmental issues, the PRDUSP lays out a development strategy in which cities are organized into hierarchies around three metropolitan areas, have different functions, and are connected by development and growth axes. Various measures and policies also are recommended. All these suggest that the Provincial Government of Guangdong is searching for a new way of regional governance.

Although a substantial literature has accumulated on this topic, relatively little attention has been given to the locational aspects of financial services. An attempt is made here to examine the spatial structure of this sector in terms of the urban system, drawing on the principles of central-place theory, the limitations and applicability of which are considered. This is followed by a discussion of the salient features of financial services within the overall urban system. After describing the differentiation of financial services in frequency terms, the hierarchical structure of the UK urban system is outlined. These two aspects are then related, in order to demonstrate the ordered nature of the spatial structure of financial services. There follows a brief discussion of the findings and their implications for future work.

AB  - In this paper, we study the hitherto unexplored evolution of the size distribution of 185 functionally defined urban areas in Brazil between 1907 and 2008. We apply the traditional power law and the Gabaix–Ibragimov improved estimation method. We find that the power parameter of the size distribution of the 100 largest urban areas increases towards unity, that is, the rank-size rule. Seventeen thousand and twenty cointegration tests of pairwise non-stationary growth paths of cities point to evidence of a common stochastic trend that strengthens throughout the century. Thus, while Zipf's law and Gibrat's law did not formally hold in Brazil's past, these laws are becoming steadily more appropriate descriptions of Brazil's increasingly unequal size distribution of cities.

In nineteenth century Victoria, communications technologies which were government directed and owned were principal agents in breaking down isolation among towns and creating a systemic character. In an historical context where recognized methods involving flow data are not possible, alternative analyses are necessary. These comprise density usage mail route maps, which rely mainly on a visual impression of systemic extension and interurban interaction, and regression models of actual on potential interaction of towns in the telegraphic and railway networks. The measure of a town's integration in the system is the level of its actual interaction in terms of volume of telephone and railway transactions, as compared with its potential for interaction arrived at by the use of the potential model.

But human capital is an economic resource that is distributed unequally in space. Some regions show a higher density of human capital than others. This paper discusses questions relating to the spatial concentration and specialisation of human capital in the German urban system. Due to an increasing interest in human capital the questions are asked, where is human capital located in the German urban system and how does the distribution change over time. The paper relates to geographical theories of concentration and specialisation. It will be shown that human capital is a heterogeneous category containing different occupational groups showing different spatial patterns. Some display increasing spatial disparities; others are fairly balanced over space.

The spatial structure of this extended system is then examined in terms of the locational arrangement of centres as well as their frequency, trade-area characteristics, spacing, and size (population).

AB  - China is now in the process of rapid urbanization. City's operating efficiency was directly determined by the scale and efficiency of energy consumption and flow. The pattern, scale and efficiency of urban carbon flow are not only important indicators that reflect urban efficiency and sustainable development, but also important references in the formulating low-carbon and sustainable energy polices for cities. Through establishing a theoretical framework and calculation method, this paper studied the carbon flows of Nanjing urban system in three different levels. It shows that urban production and transportation system, urban living system, rural production system and rural living systems are the major part of urban system in the carbon flow. The carbon flows between Nanjing and the external system, was much higher than the carbon flows among different internal subsystems. If the embodied carbon is taken into account, carbon flow from the urban to rural system of Nanjing was clearly greater than the flow in the opposite direction. With economic development and the implement of energy-saving and emission reduction policy, the carbon productivity and carbon flow efficiency in Nanjing has improved significantly since 2000. Fossil energy consumption, urbanization, agricultural activities, rural life demands and trade are key factors with major impact on urban carbon flows in Nanjing. Therefore, adjusting industrial structure, urban expansion control, and developing renewable energy are main measures to realize sustainable development of Najing city. Furthermore, the dual urban-rural structure in Nanjing brought large exchanges of products and embodied carbon between urban and rural areas, indicates that urban carbon flow and its efficiency was highly influenced by urban-rural structure, which will further aggravate carbon flow burden of urban systems. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The ESM method proposed, based on Shannon's entropy analysis, is useful to evaluate different alternative measures of new energy saving technology transfer at different programming stages for consumption reduction and environmental impact control. A case study has been conducted in an urban area of Florence (Italy): the action/factor interaction entropy values can provide a scale of intervention priority and by comparing results obtained evaluating conditional entropy, ambiguity and redundancy, it is possible to identify the highest energy sustainable intervention in terms of higher or lower critical and risky action/factor combinations for the project being carried out. The ESM method proposed, if applied to different urban areas, can provide a rational criterion to compare complex innovative and sustainable technologies for irreversibility reduction and energy efficiency increase. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban systems theory offers a useful and potentially powerful way of analysing public policy and service expenditures, a research field which, in the past, has lacked in general theory and good empirical results. It is hypothesized that just as cities which play an important role in the national urban system provide a wide range of specialized and expensive goods and services in the private sector, so also will they tend to spend heavily on a range of public services and amenities. Following recent theoretical developments, the presence of the headquarters of major companies is used as a measure of the importance of English and Welsh cities in the national urban system, and this measure is related to service expenditures. The results strongly support the hypothesis, and suggest that levels of service expenditure, particularly on what are termed indivisible services, are related to the general characteristics of an urban system, rather than directly to the concentration of business headquarters.

AB  - The diminishing importance of national frontiers in western Europe has intensified competition between cities for mobile investment, for the location of public institutions and for hallmark events. This has led to the creation of league tables of cities in which rankings are determined by single or multiple variables. Analyses of changes in rankings focus on whether there has been divergence or convergence amongst European cities. This paper uses data on 117 cities to suggest that there was convergence in 1981-84, followed by divergence in 1984-87. The paper goes on to test three hypotheses which relate urban economic growth to size or capital status, to location within the core or periphery, and location within northern or southern Europe. Overall it finds that capital cities grow more quickly, in economic terms; that the urban south is catching up with the urban north; and that, whilst the cities of the core did best before 1985, there is some evidence that 'crowding out' has relatively helped the cities of the periphery since 1985.

The simulation results show that, to a large extent, the evolution of the system can be understood in terms of endogenous system dynamics rather than exogenous events. Specifically, competition among the cities of the region is a significant factor in the urban system evolution. The high degree of abstraction of the model means that data requirements for application are minimal, and the calibration procedure is relatively simple. The successful predictions show that the model can yield useful results in spite of its simplicity." (SUMMARY IN FRE) excerpt

Se ha roto, sin duda, el paradigma de las ciudades monoc�ntricas, estructuradas en torno a un �nico CBD. Frente al downtown tradicional, las metr�polis contempor�neas han visto emerger el fen�meno de los subcentros. Sin embargo pocos esfuerzos se han dirigido a abordar de forma integrada los dos aspectos mencionados: a) la delimitaci�n urbano-metropolitana, y b) el an�lisis de la estructura interna de los sistemas urbano-metropolitanos.

AB  - In this paper I analyze the impact of basic training and specialized training on the distribution of skill, income disparity, social welfare, and on the structure of a decentralized specialized city system. This is done in a spatial general-equilibrium model of a closed economy producing a single consumption good. The economy is populated with a continuum of unskilled labor with potential heterogeneous ability. The only consumption good can be produced by specialized technology or by general technology. Specialized technology requires specialized training that enables each worker to transform his potential ability into productivity. General technology requires basic training that enables all workers, independent of their potential ability, to produce the good at a constant marginal product. In this framework I show that such an equilibrium exists uniquely and is efficient. Then I characterize the conditions that lead to a different distribution of skills, a different system of cities, and generate income disparity endogenously. Thus, the paper presents a link among income disparities, social welfare, and the structure of an urban system that is new to this literature.

This type of model is studied under the simplifying assumption that the location of places among counties is random, but the distinction between county-seat places and other places leads to the restriction that no county contains more than one county-seat place. This model is tested for urban places in the state of Iowa in terms of distribution (frequency distribution of places within counties) and arrangement (relative concentration or dispersion of places among adjacent counties). An intensive empirical examination of the model is conducted, and generally good agreement is found between values given by the model and values obtained from the Iowa urban system.

The simulation model assumes the equivalent highway model where vehicles are replaced by equivalent point sources which emit typical traffic noise. Interactions of acoustical waves with obstacles, on the path from the source to the observation point, are reduced to specular reflections from surfaces and diffraction at edges (wedges) of obstacles. The prepared PROP3 computer program allows estimation of sound equivalent level in dB(A) at the observation point in a built-up area, for a highway of known vehicles rate flow and vehicle average speed.

AB  - Recent discussions of the 'geography of gentrification' highlight the need for comparative analysis of the nature and consequences of inner-city transformation. In this paper, the authors map the effects of housing-market and policy changes in the 1990s, focusing on 23 large cities in the USA. Using evidence from field surveys and a mortgage-lending database, they measure the class selectivity of gentrification and its relation to processes of racial and ethnic discrimination. They find a strong resurgence of capital investment in the urban core, along with magnified class segregation. The boom of the 1990s and policies targeted towards 'new markets' narrowed certain types of racial and ethnic disparities in urban credit markets, but there is evidence of intensified discrimination and exclusion in gentrified neighborhoods.

AB  - "A dynamic urban model is used to study the post-war evolution of the Atlantic Canada urban system. The computer-based simulation model is calibrated for the period 1951-86 and then employed to predict the 1991 population of each CMA and CA within the system. The simulation results show that, to a large extent, the evolution of the system can be understood in terms of endogenous system dynamics rather than exogenous events. Specifically, competition among the cities of the region is a significant factor in the urban system evolution. The high degree of abstraction of the model means that data requirements for application are minimal, and the calibration procedure is relatively simple. The successful predictions show that the model can yield useful results in spite of its simplicity." (SUMMARY IN FRE) excerpt

AB  - In recent years, a three-stage mono-polar concentration of higher functions into Tokyo, regional capitals and prefectural capitals has been under way in Japan. This trend is considered to have arisen as a result of the changing spatial organization of major enterprises, exemplified by their head/branch office locations. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the national urban system of Japan by focusing on the horizontal and vertical growth of the spatial organization of major enterprises and their temporal changes during the past two decades. A total of 2,499 listed enterprises is examined here, and the data used were obtained from the Directory of Executives of Major Enterprises (kaisha shokuin roku) and Handbook of Organizations and Establishments (soshikizu jigyosho binran) published by the Diamond Inc. The findings can be summarized as follows: First, an analysis of the spatial organization of four enterprise categories based on the number of cities with branch offices reveals that the more branch offices a category has and the larger it is, the greater the concentration of head offices in Tokyo. In this situation, regional capital cities as administrative centers tend to preside over local cities. This suggests that growth of enterprise is generally accompanied by a process of concentration of head office functions into Tokyo, horizontal growth of the branch office network and vertical/hierarchical growth of administrative functions. Second, the Japanese urban system exhibits a hierarchical structure consisting of three stages: Tokyo as a strategic center, regional capital cities as administrative centers and prefectural capital cities as local business centers. However, a distinction is also observed in the case of regional capital cities; specifically, the system shows signs of differentiation between the higher rank cities of Sendai and Fukuoka and the lower rank cities of Sapporo and Hiroshima. Additionally, the growth of Omiya as a significant center in the northern portion of the Kanto region and the stagnation of Nagoya and Takamatsu are noteworthy. This movement has contributed to the collapse of a clear-cut hierarchical structure and the reorganization of the previously established urban system in the country. Third, an analysis of temporal changes in the spatial organization of the major enterprises under consideration reveals that, in the 1980s, the prefectural capital cities were chosen as the new locations of branch offices and the regional capital cities experienced an expansion of administrative functions in the form of rank elevation to unify the prefectural capitals. In the recessionary years of the 1990s, however, the closure/withdrawal of branch offices and the absorption of smaller ones into large ones generally increased, suggesting a restructuring of the spatial organization of the enterprises. In future research, we will proceed to a more detailed study of the Japanese urban system by devoting attention to differences according to industrial sector as well as studying a variety of affiliated enterprises.

Topodynamic projections are studied in order to characterize the most basic trends of the system. From pure description and forecasting, the paper moves to launching a discussion on the economic implications of the observed and projected trends in population distribution. Is the urban boom tantamount to an economic boom or is it a smoke screen hiding a further marginalisation of the West African economy on the world stage?

AB  - The demand for urban green space is increasing while availability is decreasing. The value of urban green space is that it conserves critical characteristics of the natural landscape within the urban setting. The characteristics are essential for the function of ecological processes necessary for the sustainability of an ecosystem. These goods and services we extract from ecosystems are called ecological services. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the technologies and methods by which ecological services could be restored in a disturbed urban stream system. Specific objectives included bio-retention of storm water and parking lot runoff, re-establishment of fish pool habitat, implementation of natural bank stabilization, integration of riparian zone buffers, and regulation of stream geometry for maximum in-stream ecological services. We designed off-channel subsurface bio-retention cells to reduce pollution loading to the stream from a nearby parking lot and to maximize retention volume of water in the cells to recharge stream base flow. We integrated the bio-retention cell infiltration zones with the geomorphologic design of the stream channel to provide conditions desirable for fish and other aquatic communities as well as to discourage algae blooms and mosquito infestation. We designed riparian zones with native flora to provide needed habitat for terrestrial animal communities. Finally, we used natural bank stabilization features such as root wads, native tree logs, and boulders to reduce bank erosion and channel entrenchment and to enhance refugia for aquatic organisms.

AB  - Mounting interest in the global system of cities has led many scholars\nto portray large, world-class cities as control points in the global\neconomy. From this position, they govern global banking, finance\nand international corporate relations with the assistance of advanced\n\nbusiness services and telecommunications. While large cities have\ntaken on many global functions, recent research has cast them only\nas outposts in the global economy and pays little attention to their\nrole in regional and national economies. This paper explores the\nrole of five large US cities in regional and national economies.\nUsing primary trade data for five high-order business services, we\nidentify the extent to which these large cities trade with other\nlarge cities of the US urban system, smaller-sized cities, and test\nstatistically the effect that firm attributes and physical characteristics\nof the city system have on shaping the areal extent of large city\ninteraction (trade). The results indicate that: trade is consistently\nbiased towards other large cities; the size of origin cities is associated\nwith the size of destination cities; and, distance more so than destination\ncity size plays the dominant role in shaping large city patterns\nof trade.

AB  - The crisis and challenges faced by labour, including the trade unions and social movements have proportions not yet fully understood. The repercussions, owing to globalisation, also reached Third World countries, especially intermediate countries that hold important industrial estates such as Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, etc. Brazil is part of an economic, social, political and cultural context which has universal traces of global capitalism, but also possesses singularities. During the last decades, Brazilian trade unions and social movements have either followed a different path. There was a widespread and highly significant strike movement (in the 1980s) with a notable expansion of trade unions organising salaried sectors (teachers, bank workers, public sector workers, etc.); there was also the rise of the Union Congresses such as the CUT-Central Unica dos Trabalhadores (Workers Central) and the advance of rural unionism and the Landless Workers' Movement (MST, Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Terra) and new urban social movements such as the Homeless Movements. By the end of that decade, we joined in a more significant way the challenges which were presented to the unionism and social movements. These challenges are discussed in this article. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to examine the population growth pattern of the Japanese urban settlements and the factors behind the changes between 1970 and 1990. To investigate the changing Japanese urban settlements on the basis of functional urban regions, a new definition of functional urban regions called 'Japanese Functional Urban Area' (JFUA) was established. Analyses based on the new JFUA definition, such as population change and urban development stages, show that the Japanese settlement system witnessed the concentration of population into larger settlements in the 1970s and the 1980s. The largest settlements such as Tokyo and Osaka recorded growth in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition, the Tokyo area showed a 'unipolar concentration' pattern of population growth. We can classify these areas with high levels of population growth into two types. The first one is JFUAs that contain a prefectural capital city, political centre of its region, and the second one is small or medium-sized settlements that are located near the largest settlements such as Tokyo or Nagoya. Declining areas share similar characteristics; they are remote from the largest settlements and relatively small in size. In addition, some old style manufacturing centres recorded population loss in the 1980s. Although the Japanese settlement system presents a different growth pattern from the US and UK, the factors contributing to urban change in Japan turned out to be similar. The role of the service sector was highly important to growth, whilst the declining industries such as steel and shipbuilding were no longer important in promoting regional development and influenced urban decline. This study also examines the changing population pattern of selected areas that are treated as the government's policy target areas, and shows that it is difficult to find any evidence of policy effectiveness. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - With the current debate on urban policy as background. this paper reviews recent trends in the Canadian urban system, and documents the implications of these trends for planning and public policy. Although urban planners tend not to work at this scale. the ongoing reorganization of the urban system provides the broader context for their policies and plans. The analysis focuses on the effects on cities of the demographic transition and an aging population, intense economic restructuring and shifting patterns of international trade, increased immigration and ethno-cultural diversity, and the changing role of the state. These factors, in combination, have tended to augment levels of metropolitan concentration and increase the degree of uneven growth. They have also sharpened the economic and social divide between growing and declining places, and placed additional stress on service providers and on the resources of local governments. In concluding, the paper asks whether we are creating, as an outcome of these trends, new sources of difference - new fault lines - in Canadian society and in the country's urban fabric.

AB  - This paper examines a range of empirical evidence regarding the changing employment structures of 150 Job Centre Travel-to-work Areas (JC TTWAs) which make up the British urban system. If the employment structures of all urban areas are changing in a similar fashion, then one would expect a spatial convergence of employment structures. The growth of the service sector, allied with increased numbers of women and part-time workers suggests that employment structures might be expected to converge. The Gini coefficient is utilized as a measure of the diversity of employment structures. The measures of diversity/specialization show that there was a weak convergence of employment structures throughout the urban system but, perhaps more importantly, a distinct divergence of employment structures amongst the largest metropolitan centres.

AB  - In geographic information systems (GIS) studies there has been some difficulty integrating socioeconomic and physiogeographic data. One important type of socioeconomic data, census data, offers a wide range of socioeconomic information, but is aggregated within arbitrary enumeration districts ( EDs ). Values reflect either raw counts or, when standardized, the mean densities in the EDs. On the other hand, remote sensing imagery, an important type of physiogeographic data, provides large quantities of information with more spatial details than census data. Based on the dasymetric mapping principle, this study applies multivariable regression to examine the correlation between population counts from cen~ and land cover types. The land cover map is classifwd from LandSat TM imagery. The correlation is high. Census population counts are remodeled to a GIS raster layer based on the discovered correlations coupled with scaling techniques, which offset influences from other than land cover types. The GIS raster layer depicts the population distribution with much more spatial detail than census data offer. The resulting GIS raster layer is ready to be analyzed or integrated with other GIS data. ©

AB  - The specialized literature has proposed various approaches to the delimitation of urban and metropolitan systems. Administrative aspects (administrative units historically inherited), morphological (urban continuum), some linked to the economies of agglomeration (population and employment density, urban economic activities,...) or functional interaction (home-work commuting) have been used for the definition of a metropolitan area. At the same time it has developed in recent years, an extensive literature that has come to reveal the progressive trend of the metropolitan areas to the polycentrism. There is no doubt that the monocentric city paradigm, structured around a single CBD, is broken. The contemporary metropolises have seen the emergence of the phenomenon of the sub centers. However, few efforts have been directed to address the two aspects together: a) the urban-metropolitan delimitation and b) the analysis of its internal structure. This paper addresses the challenge of defining both the metropolitan systems and their internal composition, structured or not around different sub centers. The methodology developed of the Interaction Value simultaneously allows delimiting these two levels of urban structure: the metropolitan system as a whole and the subsystems articulated around the emerging or consolidated sub centers, by measuring the functional relationships between housing and workplaces. At the same time, the Interaction Value assesses the degree of polycentrism beyond the simple identification of sub centers developed in the literature. In this sense, and using the mobility matrix supplied by the Census of 2001, this paper delimitates the urban and metropolitan systems in Spain, and presents new results concerning the internal structure of such systems. © Copyright Josep Roca Cladera, Montserrat Moix Bergadà y Blanca Arellano Ramos, 2012.

"This article presents new figures, as recently published in China, discusses their significance and draws some conclusions about the quality of modern urbanization in China.  There are mainly three basic factors responsible for the present situation:  1. The tremendous increase in the rural population; 2. The influence of historical times from which two different city systems evolved (the traditional one and the colonial); 3. The planning strategies since 1949."  The author notes that although the overall level of urbanization is low, there are considerable differences in regional urbanization levels.  It is suggested that there have been profound changes in the Chinese urban system and urban spatial distribution patterns, which are not yet reflected in the available statistics. (SUMMARY IN ENG)

The frameworks apply to the Ecuadorian amazon. Universal conceptualizations are broadly relevant; context-dependant conceptualizations are partially so. This pattern raises the question of whether a government based service sector is a mechanism for urban dominance, as were wholesaling and finance in North America. Selected case studies indicate that the urban system in the Ecuadorian Amazon is representative of present-day frontier regions.

The system exhibits three different states, i.e. moving state, saturation state and global deadlock state. With a grid coarsening method, vehicle distribution in the moving state and the saturation state has been studied. Interesting structures (e.g. windmill-like ones, T-shirt-like ones, Y-like ones) have been revealed. A metastability of the system is observed in the transition from the saturation state to the global deadlock state. The effect of an advanced traveller information system (ATIS), the traffic light period and the traffic light switch strategy have also been investigated.

AB  - Like the North American frontier, Ecuador's Amazonian margin has advanced in periodic waves. But the impetus has been extremely varied, interlacing periods of socioeco- nomic crisis with times of prosperity. Recent events in eastern Ecuador confirm that urban- ization is a fundamental component of frontier development in South America. The urbanization process is not a sign, however, of regional economic strength. Capital gains at the periphery are transferred to the nation's core region. Even the larger boom towns display little functional specialization; they are, instead, precariously dependent on employment in the public-service sector. Nonetheless, urban centers in the Ecuadorian Amazon continue to grow and to drain surrounding rural areas of younger and more educated individuals

AB  - This paper identifies hubs of knowledge-based labour in the German urban system from two perspectives: the importance of a metropolitan region as a place and the importance of a metropolitan region as an organisational node. This combination of a network perspective with a territorial perspective enables the identification of hubs. From the functional perspective, hubs are understood as important nodes of national and global networks, established by flows of people, goods, capital and information as well as by organisational and power relations. From the territorial perspective, hubs are understood as spatial clusters of organisations (firms, public authorities, non-governmental organisations). The functional focus of the paper lies on knowledge-based services. Based on data about employment and multi-branch advanced producer service firms, four main types of metropolitan regions are identified: growing knowledge hubs, stagnating knowledge hubs, stagnating knowledge regions and catch-up knowledge regions. The results show an affinity between knowledge-based work and bigger metropolitan regions as well as an east-west divide in the German urban system.

A survey of the location of 3000 establishments belonging to the 300 largest European firms provides interesting results about the factors making European cities attractive for such activities. It may be inferred from these results that they confirm a new trend called `metropolisation', which is reinforcing the top of the national urban hierarchies, as demonstrated in other studies.\n

AB  - The application of intelligent systems within the field of remote sensing is reviewed with special reference to urban land cover mapping from digital satellite imagery. Urban areas constitute spectrally heterogenous land- cover classes and call for the application of intelligent, texture-based image processing methods. The appearance of an urban land-cover class in a digital image generated by remote sensing is closely related to the spatial resolution of the image, i.e. significant changes occur as a result of increased/decreased spatial resolution. This paper discuss how texture information may be derived automatically from a generic spatial model of a possibly composite urban land cover class describing basic properties of the subordinate object classes and the spatial relations between these. A method based on prediction of cooccurrence matrix values corresponding to an urban land-cover class at a specific spatial resolution is described.

AB  - A recent study on the European integration of the Italian urban system shows that globalisation processes do not necessarily separate cities from their regional networks. The most successful cases of recent urban development in Italy are associated with the formation of metropolitan networked regions in which a major metropolitan centre is linked with cities of a lower level by hierarchical, complementary and synergetic relations. The paper examines the result of an analysis carried out on 148 major Italian daily urban systems. It takes into account two sets of indicators: one referring to the supraregional network interactions, measuring the degree of globalisation, and one referring to the proximity interactions inside the regional networks, measuring the degree of regional cohesion. They allow the definition of typologies of urban systems founded on a (normally positive) correlation between supraregional functional openness and regional integration.

The rest of the country, even the megacity Calcutta/Kolkata, appears to become increasingly peripheral. Globalization did not create regional imbalance in India, but keeps intensifying it. Within the million cities, foremost the megacities, these developments caused fundamental changes in the urban economy and led to an increasing fragmentation of urban space and growing social disparities.

AB  - It is widely recognized that certain activities have a higher capacity than others to promote economic growth and development. Many of these more dynamic activities are often said to involve 'high technology'. In this paper we first question the conceptual and operational utility of the notion 'high technology'. We then propose a more straightforward and more easily measured concept - 'high knowledge content' - demonstrating that activities of this nature may be found in 'low tech' sectors. By means of an empirical analysis, we then attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the locational dynamics of high knowledge content activities within the Canadian urban system over the period 1971-1991. Specifically, we seek to determine if this class of activities is becoming spatially more concentrated or more dispersed across the urban system. The answer to this question is particularly important for smaller communities in peripheral regions whose economic bases are highly dependent upon 'low tech' activities.

AB  - A hierarchical urban system is examined with respect to certain economic linkages or flows which exist among the different levels of the hierarchy. The underlying locational basis of the urban system is represented in terms of a standard central place model in which flows of central place goods are specified. In order to incorporate important facets of contemporary urban systems, this framework is extended to consider first the existence of specialized (non-central place) goods, and second the presence of commuting, the flows associated with each phenomenon being separately discussed. Attention is then directed to the coexistence of different types of flows, not only in terms of the interrelations among them but also in terms of the balance-of-payments implications for the various levels of the hierarchy.

AB  - We examine spatial features of the evolution of the US urban system using US Census data for 1900-1990 with non-parametric kernel estimation techniques that accommodate the complexity of the urban system. We consider spatial features of the location of cities and city outcomes in terms of population and wages. Our results suggest a number of interesting puzzles. In particular, we find that city location is essentially a random process and that interactions between cities do not help determine the size of a city. Both of these findings contradict our theoretical priors about the role of geography (physical and economic) in determining city outcomes. More detailed study suggests some solutions that allow us to restore a role for geography but a number of puzzles remain.

AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Perspectives on Canadian Urban Systems                 The Canadian urban system was first shaped by exogenous demand for staples and, subsequently, by the dichotomy between an industrial heartland and a resource based hinterland. Presently, transformations affecting the economy, policy-making and demography herald profound changes in the future configuration of the Canadian urban system. One possible scenario is a revival of the staples economy as economic globalization raises demand for commodities. Another scenario would entail a concentration of growth in large urban centres, by virtue of their attractiveness to specialized and high-order service occupations, two rapidly expanding economic sectors, and their strong pull on immigrants. In the case of either scenario, we can expect further polarization between growing and shrinking portions of the urban system (parts of the heartland in the first case and small urban areas in the second) in a neo-liberal policy context that is unfavourable to regional economic development interventions. The evolution of the Canadian urban system between 1971 and 2006 and present distributions of factors of growth and decline point to the second scenario, a growing large city-small city dichotomy. The article closes by discussing likely consequences of the resulting urban system configuration on labour market adjustments and public sector expenditure.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Research and policy debates in the United States have focused on the dramatic growth of mortgage lending in the fisky subprime sector, which serves consumers with weaker credit histories, and its concentration in racially and ethnically marginalized communities. Exidence linking the subprime boom to the proliferation of predatory abuses, however is often dismissed as anecdotal or isolated in a few unique places. In this paper, we undertake a geographical analysis ot the central justification for deregulated risk-based pricing; the proposition that subprime credit serves those who would otherwise be excluded, and reduces exclusionary credit denials. Multivariate analysis of metropolitan and individual-level proceses across the US urban system provide evidence suggesting that subprime mortgage segmentation exacerbates rather than reduces traditional inequities of denial based exclusion.

AB  - The Chinese economy has transformed from the development of industries in the early economic reform period of the 1980s to the development of service industries in the 2000s and, more recently, the emergence of producer service industries. Producer services have become increasingly important to the Chinese economy. Most studies on producer services in China mainly focus on individual cities. Spatial development of producer services at the regional and national levels is relatively less examined. In this paper we analyze the growth and location of producer services in the Chinese urban system. The study also shows that producer services are becoming spatially more concentrated across the urban system. As producer services that are important in generating economic development are more likely to be located in large metropolitan areas, they tend to reinforce the competitiveness of large cities. Moreover, the uneven spatial development of producer services suggests that small and medium cities need to conduct careful market studies and analyses on their ability to attract producer service industries before they initiate large central business district development projects and invest in massive construction of of ces.

AB  - Using the fractal theory, spatial structure analysis on the urban system in Shandong province has been made based on different spatial scale. The conclusion shows that: the spatial structure of urban system in Shandong province is local fractal. On the county-city scale, the aggregation dimension of Ji'nan system is 2.316, and Qingdao system's is 1.727, which shows that the aggregate level of Ji'nan city is worse than the level of Qingdao city. The message dimension of 107 counties or cities is 1.603, between 1 and 2, which shows the spatial distribution of counties or cities is balanced as a whole. On the prefecture-level city scale, the spatial correlation dimension of 17 cities is 1.463, and the ratio of spatial correlation dimension to the spatial correlation dimension based on the traffic net is 0.95, near to 1, which shows the traffic net across 17 cities are convenient and the interaction among cities is close.

AB  - In this paper we analyze how distances between a sample of a hundred major world cities varies when measured in cyberspace. The project develops a novel spatial stat- istical model based upon the number of user-generated placemarks indexed by Google Maps.We demonstrate how this metric captures the “invisible” patterns of intercity infor- mation flows and helps comprehend the contours of the complex digital network that exists between large urban centers across the world. Using a specially designed software program to interrogate Google Maps, a series of keyword searches (“tourism,” “business,” “hotel”) as well as each of the city names were conducted in each of the sample places. Comparing this digital measure with the material movement of people and other relevant descriptive variables, such as national economic development and language differences, we were able to provide a cogent model that plausibly explains why certain city pairs (especially those that are physically distant) exhibit strong informational linkages. While the strength of these digital connections undoubtedly demonstrates the continued importance of physical proxi- mity and established transport infrastructures in the twenty-first century, one can also observe significant evidence for [new?] digital “wormholes” which indicates that processes of globalization driven by online interaction also operates by its own rules.

AB  - In Denmark, the first actual towns can be dated to the eighth and ninth centuries. The establishment of towns became more significant in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in connection with the state-building process, and these towns were distinctly consumer towns serving as administrative, religious and military centres. From 1200 to 1350 Denmark, similar to the German area, underwent considerable urbanization; a large number of market towns were created, and in contrast to the older ones they were mercantile towns. Denmark thus clearly became the most urbanized country in Scandinavia. As Copenhagen grew in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the urban system decisively changed its character in the direction of a primate system. The characteristics of the primate system are particularly distinct within the boundaries of the Kingdom of Denmark, but less pronounced if the entire monarchy is included in the period in which Denmark was a conglomerate state. The institutional conditions must in general be attributed considerable importance in explaining Danish urban development. Thus, Denmark is one of the countries where town privileges were of great significance until the middle of the nineteenth century.

Because the coastal region is different in the level of socio-economic development, location and accessibility from inland region, the former has more opportunities for development. In the coastal region urban clusters are spreading and new ones are appearing. However, a large floating population, congestion, urban sprawl, and environmental pollution have become serious problems in coastal cities.

AB  - Recent discussions of the 'geography of gentrification' highlight the need for comparative analysis of the nature and consequences of inner-city transformation. In this paper, the authors map the effects of housing-market and policy changes in the 1990s, focusing on 23 large cities in the USA. Using evidence from field surveys and a mortgage-lending database, they measure the class selectivity of gentrification and its relation to processes of racial and ethnic discrimination. They find a strong resurgence of capital investment in the urban core, along with magnified class segregation. The boom of the 1990s and policies targeted towards 'new markets' narrowed certain types of racial and ethnic disparities in urban credit markets, but there is evidence of intensified discrimination and exclusion in gentrified neighborhoods.

Since 1900 the geographical distribution of these cities has become increasingly dispersed; their city-size distribution by rank was nearly linear in 1900 and 1940, and convex in 1980. We interpret the convex distribution which emerged following World War 2 as reflecting an economically integrated but politically and demographically partitioned global urban system.  Our interpretation of changes in size distribution of cities emphasizes demographic considerations, largely neglected in previous investigations, including migration and relative rates of population change."

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to model the national and regional city-size distribution of the Saudi Arabian urban system using 1987 population estimates, and to examine the factors that have influenced the development of the urban system. The pareto coefficients of the national and regional distributions were found to be low, signifying the prevalence of smaller sized cities in the distribution. The national system was found to have a multi-city primacy situation, while the regional distributions displayed varied primacy characteristics. Factors noted to influence the development of the urban system include geographical and economic factors, as well as public policies. The paper identified three areas of population agglomeration and it is concluded that future growth might lead to a regional convergence depending on policy initiatives and on whether the urban system follows the typical pattern of other urban systems. © 1996 Journals Oxford Ltd.

AB  - The city-size structure and spatial distribution of the urban system reflect socioeconomic development and its spatial distribution. By tracking the development of the urban system, we can not only monitor the development of the society, but also reveal problems in the process of development and thereby provide a basis for policymaking. Yeh and Xu (1985) analyzed the development of China's urban system between 1949 and 1978. Since 1978 a series of new policies has been introduced, including rural reform, urban reform, establishment of the socialist market system, the opening to the outside world, and emphasis on the development of the coastal region of China. All have contributed to China's emergence as the most rapidly growing economy in the world and have dramatically changed its economic structure and pattern of regional development. Correspondingly, significant changes also have taken place within China's urban system. This paper focuses on new trends in China's urban system between 1978 and 1990 and their relationships with economic development during this period.

AB  - We estimated vertical and lateral fluxes of carbon for the isolated coastal city of Ensenada (Baja California, Mexico). In 2005, the city had a resident population of about 261,000, with tourism adding about 1.5%; it occupied an area of roughly 68 square kilometers (km(2)). Carbon (C) export was estimated at 400 gigagrams of carbon per year (Gg C/yr); notable sources to the atmosphere were combustion engines (42%), cement production (38%), water heating and cooking (7%), and human respiration (6%). Solid waste (6%) was exported for burial, but efflux to the bay was minor (about 0.1 Gg C/yr). Local deposition was limited to sewage sludge (about 2 Gg C/yr), asphalt, and extremely low primary production. Remote fluxes driven by local demand could be estimated only for electricity (61 Gg C/yr), but local flux from cement and other industrial production might be attributed largely to external demand. The urban system output to the atmosphere was about 6.4 kilograms of carbon per square meter per year (kg C/m(2)/yr), or roughly 23.6 kg/m(2)/yr in CO(2) equivalence. By comparison, net ecosystem productivity in the surrounding watershed has been estimated at 0.04 kg C/m(2)/yr, so the city's atmospheric output of C might be balanced by productivity over about 11,000 km(2) of the surrounding ecosystems. Between 2000 and 2005, C output increased faster than population growth, particularly from engine fuels.

AB  - The Colombian urban system went from a polycentric structure, in the nineteenth century, to a network organized around four cities, energized by industrial development in the first half of the twentieth century. From the fifties, the acceleration of industrialization under a Keynesian model and the restructuring of regional economies by diversifying exports and mining, led to a growing primacy of Bogotá. The enthronement of the country in the process of globalization in the nineties and the subsequent industrial and agricultural crises remodeled regional economies, causing stagnation in some regions such as the Coffee and the upper valley of the Magdalena and revitalization of cities such as Bucaramanga and Cartagena. This paper examines the latter period, with the aim of providing an overview of the current structure of the network of cities, now modeled by processes of economic globalization and political liberalization.

Analyses of those variations, using measures particularly relevant to comparative study, show that Maori segregation was greatest in both 1991 and 2001 in larger urban areas and, especially, in those with relatively large Maori populations. A major deviation from this general pattern was in Auckland; further analysis suggests that this was because of considerable sharing of residential space involving Maori and Pacific Islanders. If the total population claiming a Polynesian identity is studied, the relationships between segregation and both size and Polynesian population share are clarified.

AB  - This research investigates the evolution of the system of Canadian\ndecision-making centers using the location of corporate board members\nas a surrogate for the location of economic control. The major premise\nexamined by this study states that, through much of the study period,\nboard linkages should tend to concentrate on Toronto, Canada's dominant\ncorporate administration center. While Toronto gains importance,\nMontreal loses connections, devolving from close competition with\nToronto for national influence to become a major regional center for\nQuebec. At the same time, cities in other parts of the country gain\nimportance as they evolve into major centers for their region. The\nresult of these changes is the emergence of a dominant national center,\nalong with a second tier of cities of regional importance.\nThe results of the board member analysis reveal that the economy as a\nwhole increasingly concentrates control in Toronto through the 1970s\nand 1980s. Montreal loses director connections with the rest of the\ncountry through the same period. While the economy as a whole\ncentralizes in Toronto, certain sectors of the economy decentralize\ntheir directors to regional centers. Calgary, in particular, emerges as\na major regional center for western Canada. The paper relates these\nobservations to the dual conceptual frameworks of quaternary location\ntheory and the resource dependence perspective.

The computer-based simulation model is calibrated for the period 1951-86 and then employed to predict the 1991 population of each CMA and CA within the system. The simulation results show that, to a large extent, the evolution of the system can be understood in terms of endogenous system dynamics rather than exogenous events. Specifically, competition among the cities of the region is a significant factor in the urban system evolution. The high degree of abstraction of the model means that data requirements for application are minimal, and the calibration procedure is relatively simple. The successful predictions show that the model can yield useful results in spite of its simplicity." (SUMMARY IN FRE)

AB  - The paper examines the geography of corporate headquarters in the Australian urban system, giving consideration to their location, control of capital and performance. The paper argues that, while considerable recent attention has been given to global cities in the networks of corporate power, the spatial organisation of company headquarters remains important within national urban systems. In the case of Australia, Sydney and Melbourne dominate the corporate landscape, although the smaller cities of Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth occupy important niches. The paper demonstrates that there are clear variations in the relative performance of companies across the Australian urban system. There is also a pattern of sectoral specialisation within Australia's cities which, in part, helps to explain the different development trajectories and relative levels of corporate performance. The paper concludes by exploring some of the implications of the study for the understanding of urban systems.

AB  - This study analyses differences between counter-urban movers and movers heading for other destinations. Through the elaboration of a spatial model based upon settlement structure and functional hinterlands, counter-urban migration can be measured on the ground throughout the urban system. Empirical analysis of the counter-urban mover is rendered possible by access to a comprehensive longitudinal micro-database that contains demographic, socio-economic and detailed geographic information for all Swedish citizens. Binomial and multinomial logit models are estimated to capture the partial effects of variables related to the individual, the household, the labour market, life course events, and regional economic conditions on the choice of migration destination. The results of the analyses show that counter-urban movers are more likely to be older, born in Sweden or any other Scandinavian country, less well-off, having a university qualification, living single, being outside the labour force, and becoming unemployed close to the migration event. The emerging picture of the Swedish counter-urban mover reveals an individual who may be striving for other qualities in life, where career and earnings are of minor importance. Somewhat unexpectedly, the counter-urban movers show no systematic differences depending on their place of departure. No clear hierarchy-specific effects across the urban system can be found. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A review of material flow analysis (MFA) tools, comparison of case studies and analysis of approximately 20 MFA tools (static, semi-empirical models) are performed. The evaluation of the quantification procedures revealed several deficits in the approaches. The following principal complications for a reliable quantification of inputs from the urban water system are identified: (1) frequently insufficient data for urban system model validation (e.g. combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges); (2) the necessity for additionally quantifying diffuse sources in order to verify modelling results at basin scale, where both input pathways occur, and (3) the contradictions arising when describing the highly dynamic urban system with the help of static MFA models. However, a wise selection of appropriate calculation procedures with regard to the concrete systems characteristics and available data can minimize the model deviations significantly. Criteria and suggestions for designing adapted quantification procedures are given.
