AB  - This article identifies drivers of forest transition in a province of Northern Vietnam between 1993 and 2000 by applying geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis to remotely sensed and statistical data. The regression model highlighted the spatial variation of the relationship between the percentage of land afforested and its proximate causes. Factors identified as having a major impact on afforestation are: the presence or proximity of a wood-processing industry, the distance to highways, and land allocation to households. Whereas the two former variables are in most areas of the province positively correlated with afforestation, an unexpected negative correlation was observed for the latter. The analysis of these results, supported by an in-depth knowledge of the area and of the political context, leads to the conclusion that, during the time period considered, afforestation was largely driven by state organisations on protected state-owned land, and forestry was not a significant component of household economic activities. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Abstract Regional convergence of German labour markets represents a politically important question. Different studies have examined convergence processes in Germany. We derive equations to estimate the speed of convergence on the basis of an extended Solow model. The technique of geographically weighted regression permits a detailed analysis of convergence processes, which has not been conducted for Germany as yet. It allows the estimation of a separate speed of convergence for every region resulting from the local coefficients of the regression equations. The application of this technique to German labour market regions shows regions moving at different speeds towards their steady states. The half-life periods in the model of conditional convergence disperse less than the same coefficients in the absolute convergence model. Moreover, the speed of convergence is substantially slower in the manufacturing sector than in the service sector.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression and the expansion method are two statistical techniques which can be used to examine the spatial variability of regression results across a region and so inform on the presence of spatial nonstationarity. Rather than accept one set of 'global' regression results, both techniques allow the possibility of producing 'local' regression results from any point within the region so that the output from the analysis is a set of mappable statistics which denote local relationships. Within the paper, the application of each technique to a set of health data from northeast England is compared. Geographically weighted regression is shown to produce more informative results regarding parameter variation over space.

AB  - The fertility decline that Turkey has gone through in the last few decades is characterised by sharp regional inequalities, with western regions representing patterns akin to developed countries and those in the east resembling "third-world" countries, while central regions represent an in-between case. With the help of geographically weighted regression (GWR), this article is an attempt to set up a model of causal relationships that could account for the regional fertility differentials. The results indicate that the fertility decline is not a single and all-embracing process covering all regions. On the contrary, there are regions differentiated qualitatively from each other in terms of the underlying causes of the existing fertility levels.

AB  - In view of the variability in the accuracy of the land use/cover data derived from satellite data, population estimation using a global ordinary linear regression (OLS) model cannot deal with the spatial non-stationarity problem. This research applied a local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model using four land use area variables (high-density urban use, low-density urban use, cropland, and forest) for population estimation in the city of Atlanta, Georgia at the census tract level, and found that the four-class local GWR model could help improve the accuracy of population estimation over a four-class global OLS model by 28%. The spatial non-stationarity seemed to be affected by the core-periphery locations in the city. This research also confirmed that a regional regression approach based on census tracts aggregated by counties could minimize spatial non-stationarity, and produced more accurate population estimation than that for the study area as a whole using the global OLS model, thus pointing to a way to improve population estimation using the traditional global model. The GWR model also identified the parts of the city where spatial non-stationarity is least influential, and as a result, a global OLS model could be used for population estimation.

AB  - This research note examined the performance of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) using two calibration methods. The first method, Cross Validation (CV), has been commonly used in the applied literature using GWR. A second criterion selected an optimal bandwidth that corresponded with the smallest spatial error Lagrange Multiplier (LM) test statistic. We find that there is a tradeoff between addressing spatial autocorrelation and reducing degree of extreme coefficients in GWR. Although spatial autocorrelation can be controlled for by using the LM criterion, a substantial degree of extreme coefficients may remain. However, while the CV approach appears to be less prone to producing extreme coefficients, it may not always attend to the problems that arise in the presence of spatial error autocorrelation.

AB  - Present methodological research on geographically weighted regression (GWR) focuses primarily on extensions of the basic GWR model, while ignoring well-established diagnostics tests commonly used in standard global regression analysis. This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local GWR coeffcients at a single location and the overall correlation between GWR coeffcients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coeffcients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these fndings, applied GWR research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local GWR coeffcients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the GWR multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coeffcient dependency issues in GWR. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.

AB  - Visualizing and interpreting output from spatially varying coefficient models, such as geographically weighted regression (GWR), can be challenging, given the amount of information the models provide the spatial analyst. Adding to the visualization dilemma are various diagnostic tools for checking the coherence of the model. One such diagnostic tool is based on decomposing the regression coefficient variance matrix to test for collinearity, which is relevant because previous research has shown that collinearity can lead to estimated regression coefficients for multiple regression terms that are strongly correlated with each other. In this paper, I present visualization tools, such as linked scatter plots, parallel coordinate plots, and maps, for diagnosing correlation in estimated regression coefficients that can be problematic for statistical inference on relationships between variables. These tools help explain patterns of dependence between regression terms apparent in scatter plots of estimated coefficients and link the structure in the scatter plots to locational information in a map. Visualization of this information should aid in the typical spatially varying coefficient model estimation process. I apply the methodological approaches to model census undercount in Franklin County, Ohio.

AB  - An analysis of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco var. glauca) site index (SI) was performed in north central Idaho using two forms of linear regression: standard multiple linear regression (MLR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). The hypothesis was that the GWR model would provide better estimates of SI using edaphic, topographic, and climatic predictor variables than ordinary MLR. Elevation, volcanic ash depth, slope, and aspect were significantly correlated with Douglas-fir SI (R-A(2) = 0.5). GWR accounted for an additional 29% of the variation in SI and reduced the error sum of squares by approximately 53%. The geographically weighted parameter estimates of the model intercept and elevation were nonstationary, which indicates that geographic location determines the influence of a variable on SI. Residual analysis from a MLR model showed large SI prediction error throughout the study area. This prediction error was significantly reduced using the GWR model. GWR shows promise for biological modeling.

AB  - The spatial patterns of fire occurrence were analyzed in two regions of Southern Europe, focusing on the long-term factors that influence fire distribution. The relationship between fire occurrence and the physical and anthropogenic variables collected was investigated with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and the results were compared with Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Local patterns of the significant variables were explored and a strong spatial variability of their explanatory power was revealed. Climate (precipitation), livestock and land cover (shrubland) were found to be significant in both regions, although in particular areas and to different extents. Regarding model performance, GWR showed an improvement over OLS in both regions. The investigation of the spatial variation in the importance of the main drivers over a broad study area, gives a valuable contribution to the improvement of fire management and prevention strategies, adjusted to the particular conditions of different areas.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR), as a useful method for exploring spatial nonstationarity of a regression relationship, has been applied to a variety of areas. In this method a spatially varying coefficient model is locally calibrated and the spatial-variation patterns of the locally estimated regression coefficients are taken as the main evidence of spatial nonstationarity for the underlying data-generating processes. Therefore, the validity of the analysis results drawn by GWR is closely dependent on the accuracy between the underlying coefficients and their estimates. Motivated by the local polynomial-modelling technique in statistics, we propose a local linear-based GWR for the spatially varying coefficient models, in which the coefficients are locally expanded as linear functions of the spatial coordinates and then estimated by the weighted least-squares procedure. Some theoretical and numerical comparisons with GWR are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve GWR, not only in goodness-of-fit of the whole regression function but also in reducing bias of the coefficient estimates.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is drawing attention as a statistical method to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable. Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset.

AB  - Traditional regression analysis methods such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) are usually used to explore data relations, but they cannot reflect the spatial non-stationarity of the data. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is an effective tool for dealing with this situation, whereas there has not any related studies about using GWR to analyze the landslide surface deformation. This paper tries to base on a typical reservoir-type landslide in Three Gorges Reservoir area of Yangtze River, China, and uses monitoring data, to build OLS and GWR model between landslide surface displacements and trigger factors by ArcGIS. Analysis showed that the GWR model has greater R2 and smaller Akaike information criterion (AIC) value, and the residuals spatial autocorrelation degree can be significantly reduced then the OLS model, what means the GWR model can capture the spatial non-stationarity of independent variables and is more reliable in analysis of landslide surface deformation. ¬© (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - The present research examines a structural model of violent crime in Portland, Oregon, exploring spatial patterns of both crime and its covariates. Using standard structural measures drawn from an opportunity framework, the study provides results from a global ordinary least squares model, assumed to fit for all locations within the study area. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is then introduced as an alternative to such traditional approaches to modeling crime. The GWR procedure estimates a local model, producing a set of mappable parameter estimates and t-values of significance that vary over space. Several structural measures are found to have relationships with crime that vary significantly with location. Results indicate that a mixed model- with both spatially varying and fixed parameters-may provide the most accurate model of crime. The present study demonstrates the utility of GWR for exploring local processes that drive crime levels and examining misspecification of a global model of urban violence. 10.1177/0894439307298925

AB  - The application of geographically weighted regression (GWR) ‚Äì a local spatial statistical technique used to test for spatial nonstationarity ‚Äì has grown rapidly in the social, health and demographic sciences. GWR is a useful exploratory analytical tool that generates a set of location-specific parameter estimates which can be mapped and analysed to provide information on spatial nonstationarity in relationships between predictors and the outcome variable. A major challenge to GWR users, however, is how best to map these parameter estimates. This paper introduces a simple mapping technique that combines local parameter estimates and local t-values on one map. The resultant map can facilitate the exploration and interpretation of nonstationarity.

However, estimating a local model reveals that the influence of the independent variables is inconstant over the whole study area. In this research, classic linear regression was reviewed, and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) method which belongs to local estimation was introduced. The GWR method is able to show local patterns in the spatial distribution of a parameter, which would be ignored by the OLS approach. The relationship Between Crown Width and DBH was discussed as a case study. After analyzing attribute and spatial information of the 60 trees, it is clear that there was a significant improvement in the Crown-Width model performance of GWR over ordinary least square (OLS).

AB  - The effective use of spatial information, that is the geographic locations of population units, in a regression model-based approach to small area estimation is an important practical issue. One approach for incorporating such spatial information in a small area regression model is via Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). In GWR the relationship between the outcome variable and the covariates is characterised by local rather than global parameters, where local is defined spatially. In this paper we investigate GWR-based small area estimation under the M-quantile modelling approach. In particular, we specify an M-quantile GWR model that is a local model for the M-quantiles of the conditional distribution of the outcome variable given the covariates. This model is then used to define a bias-robust predictor of the small area characteristic of interest that also accounts for spatial association in the data. An important spin-off from applying the M-quantile GWR small area model is that it can potentially offer more efficient synthetic estimation for out of sample areas. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework through both model-based as well as design-based simulations, with the latter based on a realistic survey data set. The paper concludes with an illustrative application that focuses on estimation of average levels of Acid Neutralizing Capacity for lakes in the north-east of the USA.

AB  - Proposed and implemented is a regression framework, which extends the programming language Java with regression analysis, i.e., the capability to do parameter estimation for a function. The regression framework is unique in that functional forms for regression analysis are expressed as Java programs, in which some parameters are not a priori known, but need to be learned from training sets provided as input. Typical applications of this regression framework include calibration of parameters of computational processes, described as OO programs. To implement regression learning, the compiler of this framework (1) analyses the structure of the parameterized Java program that represents a functional form, (2) automatically generates a constraint optimization problem, in which constraint variables are the unknown parameters, and the objective function to be minimized is the sum of squares of errors with regarding to the training set, and (3) solves the optimization problem using an external nonlinear optimization solver. Then the framework executes as a regular Java program, in which the initially unknown parameters are replaced with the found optimal values. The syntax and semantics of the regression framework are formally defined and exemplified in the geographically weighted regression model.

AB  - Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a local modelling technique to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships. Generally, the Euclidean distance is the default metric for calibrating a GWR model in previous research and applications; however, it may not always be the most reasonable choice due to a partition by some natural or man-made features. Thus, we attempt to use a non-Euclidean distance metric in GWR. In this study, a GWR model is established to explore spatially varying relationships between house price and floor area with sampled house prices in London. To calibrate this GWR model, network distance is adopted. Compared with the other results from calibrations with Euclidean distance or adaptive kernels, the output using network distance with a fixed kernel makes a significant improvement, and the river Thames has a clear cut-off effect on the parameter estimations. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The behavior of variables at a local level was analysed, and some of them were found to present significant spatial variability. This represents an improvement on the understanding offered by global analysis as, rather than producing an average coefficient for the entire territory, the technique yields an estimated coefficient for each location analysed; in other words, the type of relationship that exists in each portion of the territory is ascertained, and not only a general overview. This method reveals aspects of the relationships which do not emerge when using traditional global specifications, such as sign change in some of the parameter estimates. ¬© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

These indices are usually global indices and summarise the accuracy. In this study, a more detailed accuracy is discussed by examining the magnitudes and spatial patterning of elevation errors. Many researches have demonstrated the effects of interpolation methods and the nature of errors in digital elevation models for small-scale areas. On the contrary, this study investigated the size and spatial patterning of errors in a large-scale area, by comparing three different interpolation algorithms. This research also examined the accuracy related with data density and surface characteristics at the field scale. Finally, ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression models were used to model the relationship between error and surface characteristics. Geographically weighted regression modelling gave better results than ordinary least-squares regression modelling.

AB  - Most of currently reported models for predicting PM2.5 concentrations from satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth are global methods without considering local variations, which might introduce significant biases into prediction results. In this paper, a geographically weighted regression model was developed to examine the relationship among PM2.5, aerosol optical depth, meteorological parameters, and land use information. Additionally, two meteorological datasets, North American Regional Reanalysis and North American Land Data Assimilation System, were fitted into the model separately to compare their performances. The study area is centered at the Atlanta Metro area, and data were collected from various sources for the year 2003. The results showed that the mean local R2 of the models using North American Regional Reanalysis was 0.60 and those using North American Land Data Assimilation System reached 0.61. The root mean squared prediction error showed that the prediction accuracy was 82.7% and 83.0% for North American Regional Reanalysis and North American Land Data Assimilation System in model fitting, respectively, and 69.7% and 72.1% in cross validation. The results indicated that geographically weighted regression combined with aerosol optical depth, meteorological parameters, and land use information as the predictor variables could generate a better fit and achieve high accuracy in PM2.5 exposure estimation, and North American Land Data Assimilation System could be used as an alternative of North American Regional Reanalysis to provide some of the meteorological fields. ¬© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression and the expansion method are two statistical techniques which can be used to examine the spatial variability of regression results across a region and so inform on the presence of spatial nonstationarity. Rather than accept one set of 'global' regression results, both techniques allow the possibility of producing 'local' regression results from any point within the region so that the output from the analysis is a set of mappable statistics which denote local relationships. Within the paper, the application of each technique to a set of health data from northeast England is compared. Geographically weighted regression is shown to produce more informative results regarding parameter variation over space. [References: 25]

AB  - A mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model is a kind of regression model in which some coefficients of the explanatory variables are constant, but others vary spatially. It is a useful statistical modelling tool in a number of areas of spatial data analysis. After an MGWR model is identified and calibrated, which has been well studied recently, one of the important inference problems is to evaluate the influence of the explanatory variables in the constant-coefficient part on the response of the model. This is useful in the selection of the variables and for the purpose of explanation. In this paper, a statistical inference framework for this issue is suggested and, besides the F-approximation, which has been frequently used in the literature of the geographically weighted regression technique, a bootstrap procedure for deriving the p-value of the test is also suggested. The performance of the test is investigated by extensive simulations. It is demonstrated that both the F-approximation and the bootstrap procedure work satisfactorily.

AB  - In view of the variability in the accuracy of the land use/cover data derived from satellite data, population estimation using a global ordinary linear regression (OLS) model cannot deal with the spatial non-stationarity problem. This research applied a local geographically weighted regression (GWR) model using four land use area variables (high-density urban use, low-density urban use, crop-land, and forest) for population estimation in the city of Atlanta, Georgia at the census tract level, and found that the four-class local GWR model could help improve the accuracy of population estimation over a four-class global OLS model by 28%. The spatial non-stationarity seemed to be affected by the core-periphery locations in the city. This research also confirmed that a regional regression approach based on census tracts aggregated by counties could minimize spatial non-stationarity, and produced more accurate population estimation than that for the study area as a whole using the global OLS model, thus pointing to a way to improve population estimation using the traditional global model. The GWR model also identified the parts of the city where spatial non-stationarity is least influential, and as a result, a global OLS model could be used for population estimation.

AB  - In recent years, geographically weighted regression (GWR) has become popular for modeling spatial heterogeneity in a regression context. However, the current weighting function used in GWR only considers the geographical distances of trees in a stand, while the attributes (e.g., tree diameter) of the neighboring trees are totally ignored. In this study, we proposed a new weighting function that combines the "geographical space" and "attribute space" between the subject tree and its neighbors, such that (1) neighbors with greater geographical distances from the subject tree are assigned smaller weights, and (2) at a given geographical distance, neighboring trees with sizes that are similar to that of the subject tree are assigned larger weights. The results indicate that the GWR model with the new spatialattribute weighting function performs better than the one with the spatial weighting function in terms of model residuals and predictions for different spatial patterns of tree locations.

AB  - Understanding why and how people choose to travel is an important consideration for politicians, transport planners, academics and other interested groups. Of the factors that influence travel behaviour, one of the most commonly cited as having a significant influence is income. This article presents a cross-sectional model that relates the income in UK Local Authority Wards to one facet of travel behaviour, namely car-ownership. All the data used is freely available from the Office for National Statistics' Census 2001 web site. For the analysis, the technique of Geographically Weighted Regression is applied. This technique takes account of the geographical proximity of each observation - giving a higher weight to observed data from nearby Wards. The article concludes with the suggested application to other UK Census travel to work statistics and how the analysis may be enhanced.

AB  - Natural amenities play an important role in explaining intra-regional economic growth, because they increase the competition between places and the relative demand for housing. This paper shows that these relationships are strongly location-specific, such that the magnitude and the direction, of value assessments vary across the urban surface. The analysis in this study addresses spatial heterogeneity in the valuations of preserved open space amenities using Swedish house price data. The results show that marginal valuations of open space amenities are high in locations that are characterised by high population and housing densities and low or insignificant in areas where undeveloped lands are abundant, thus, supporting the hypothesis that a greater competition for those, locational attributes that are in high demand, yet locally scarce, results in higher marginal prices. ?? 2013.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR), as a useful method for exploring spatial nonstationarity of a regression relationship, has been applied to a variety of areas. In this method a spatially varying coefficient model is locally calibrated and the spatial-variation patterns of the locally estimated regression coefficients are taken as the main evidence of spatial nonstationarity for the underlying data-generating processes. Therefore, the validity of the analysis results drawn by GWR is closely dependent on the accuracy between the underlying coefficients and their estimates. Motivated by the local polynomial-modelling technique in statistics, we propose a local linear-based GWR for the spatially varying coefficient models, in which the coefficients are locally expanded as linear functions of the spatial coordinates and then estimated by the weighted least-squares procedure. Some theoretical and numerical comparisons with GWR are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve GWR, not only in goodness-of-fit of the whole regression function but also in reducing bias of the coefficient estimates.

AB  - Areal interpolation is used to transfer attribute information from the initial set of source units with known values to the target units with unknown values before subsequent spatial analysis can occur. The areal units with unknown attribute information can be either at a finer scale or misaligned with respect to the source data layer. This article presents and describes a geographically weighted regression (GWR) method for solving areal interpolation problems for nested areal units and misaligned areal units. Population data, selected as the attribute information, are interpolated from census tracts to block groups (a finer scale) and pseudo-tracts (misaligned from tracts but at the same approximate scale). Root mean square error, adjusted root mean square error, and mean absolute error are calculated to evaluate the performance of the interpolation methods. The land cover data derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper Satellite Imagery with a 30?30 m spatial resolution are applied to as the ancillary data to describe the underlying distribution of population. To evaluate the utility of GWR as an areal interpolation method, the simple areal weighting method, a dasymetric method, and different ordinary least squares regression methods are used in this article as comparison methods. Results suggest that GWR is a better interpolator for the misaligned data problem than for the finer scale data problem. The latter is a result of issues associated with the scaling step to ensure the pycnophylatic property required in areal interpolation.

AB  - There are significant spatial differences on carbon emissions across China's provinces. The goal of this work is to explore diverse factors of carbon emissions and space pattern across China's provinces. IPCC carbon emission model is used to calculate the carbon emissions in China province. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is the method for modeling the local relationships, helps to reveal the spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, we calculated the spatial relationships on carbon emissions and its influence factors, and estimated the factors' coefficient by GWR. The carbon emissions coefficient is in the range of 0.868 to 2.650 from energy structure. The carbon emissions coefficient is in the range of 0.868 to 2.650 from industrial structure. Our findings indicate that significantly non-equilibrium and spatial differences exist between the China's provinces carbon emissions and the each factor. Therefore, these results provide the basis for making carbon emission reduction measures across China's provinces.

AB  - Spatial data contain locational information as well as attribute information. It is increasingly recognized that most data sets are spatial in that the attribute being measured is typically recorded either at some specific location or as a representation of a general area. It is also increasingly recognized that spatial data exhibit special properties which distinguish them from aspatial data and which necessitate the development of specialized statistical techniques. For instance, spatial data almost invariably exhibit some form of spatial dependence whereby locations in close proximity tend to have more similar attributes than do locations further apart. This tends to invalidate the assumption of the independence of error terms, a fundamental property of classical aspatial statistical inference.

AB  - Most standard methods of statistical analysis used in the social and environmental sciences are built upon the basic assumptions of independence, homogeneity, and isotropy. A notable exception to this rule is the collection of methods used in geographical analysis, which have been designed to take into account serial dependence often observed in spatial data. In addition, recent developments, in particular the method of geographically weighted regression, have provided the tools to model non-stationary processes, and thus evidence that challenges the assumption of homogeneity. The assumption of isotropy, however although suspect, has received considerably less attention, and there is thus a need for tools to study anisotropy in a more systematic fashion. In this paper we expand the method of geographically weighted regression in a simple yet effective way to explore the topic of anisotropy in spatial processes. We discuss two different estimation situations and exemplify the proposed technical development by means of a case study. The results suggest that anisotropy issues might be a fairly common occurrence in spatial processes and/or in the statistical modeling of spatial processes.

This enables the spatial drift of regression parameters to be identified, estimated and mapped. It is shown that the rate of increase of precipitation with height, or height coefficient, varies from around 4.5 mm/m in the northwest to almost zero in the southeast. There is a particularly rapid change in this value across the English Midlands. The predicted sea level precipitation varies from 1250 mm to less than 600 mm in much the same way.

AB  - Proposed and implemented is a regression framework, which extends the programming language Java with regression analysis, i.e., the capability to do parameter estimation for a function. The regression framework is unique in that functional forms for regression analysis are expressed as Java programs, in which some parameters are not a priori known, but need to be learned from training sets provided as input. Typical applications of this regression framework include calibration of parameters of computational processes, described as OO programs. To implement regression learning, the compiler of this framework (1) analyses the structure of the parameterized Java program that represents a functional form, (2) automatically generates a constraint optimization problem, in which constraint variables are the unknown parameters, and the objective function to be minimized is the sum of squares of errors with regarding to the training set, and (3) solves the optimization problem using an external nonlinear optimization solver. Then the framework executes as a regular Java program, in which the initially unknown parameters are replaced with the found optimal values. The syntax and semantics of the regression framework are formally defined and exemplified in the geographically weighted regression model.

AB  - Industry is the most important sector in the Chinese economy. To identify the spatial interaction between the level of regional industrialisation and various factors, this paper takes Jiangsu province of China as a case study. To unravel the existence of spatial nonstationarity, geographically weighted regression (GWR) is employed in this article. Conventional regression analysis can only produce "average" and "global" parameter estimates rather than "local" parameter estimates which vary over space in some spatial systems. Geographically weighted regression (GWR), on the other hand, is a relatively simple, but useful new technique for the analysis of spatial nonstationarity. Using the GWR technique to study regional industrialisation in Jiangsu province, it is found that there is a significant difference between the ordinary linear regression (OLR) and GWR models. The relationships between the level of regional industrialisation and various factors show considerable spatial variability.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was introduced to the geography literature by Brunsdon et al. (1996) to study the potential for relationships in a regression model to vary in geographical space, or what is termed parametric nonstationarity. GWR is based on the non-parametric technique of locally weighted regression developed in statistics for curve-fitting and smoothing applications, where local regression parameters are estimated using subsets of data proximate to a model estimation point in variable space. The innovation with GWR is using a subset of data proximate to the model calibration location in geographical space instead of variable space. While the emphasis in traditional locally weighted regression in statistics has been on curve-fitting, that is estimating or predic ting the response variable, GWR has been presented as a method to conduct inference on spatially varying relationships, in an attempt to extend the original emphasis on prediction to confirmatory analysis (P√°ez and Wheeler 2009).

AB  - Mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model is a useful technique to explore spatial non- stationarity by allowing that some coefficients of the explanatory variables are constant and others are spatially varying, but its estimation and inference have not been systematically studied. This paper is concerned with estimation and testing of the model when there are certain linear constraints on the elements of constant coefficients. We propose a constrained two-step technique for estimating the constant coefficients and spatial varying coefficients, and develop a test procedure for the validity of the linear constraints. Finally, some simulations are conducted to examine the performance of our proposed procedure and the results are satisfactory.

AB  - "Geographically Weighted Regression: The Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships" is based on the premise that relationships between variables measured at different locations might not be constant over space. The prevailing assumption is that such relationships are constant, an assumption that would appear to be the result of convenience rather than of any serious examination of the issues. If relationships do vary significantly over space, then serious questions are raised about the reliability of traditional, global-level analyses. Geographically Weighted Regression, as part of a broader research area in local modelling, provides a new analytical tool and a different perspective on spatial analysis. Instead of being restricted to simple global analyses in which interesting local variations in relationships are 'averaged away' and unobservable, GWR allows local relationships to be measured and mapped. In many ways the output from GWR is similar to that presented by a microscope: previously unimagined detail suddenly comes into focus. This book challenges many of the global statements of spatial relationships that have been made in the academic literature. "Geographically Weighted Regression: The Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships" contains a broad discussion of local models in general and of the details of GWR, and provides many empirical examples on issues such as house price determinants, educational attainment levels and school performance statistics. A unique accompanying feature of this book is the author-written software that allows users to undertake sophisticated and complex forms of GWR within a user-friendly, Windows-based, front-end. This software is readily available from the authors and notes on using the software and an example application are documented in the book itself. " Geographically Weighted Regression: The Analysis of Spatially Varying Relationships "is an essential resource for quantitative spatial analysts and GIS researchers and students. It will be of interest to researchers in any discipline in which spatial data are used across the broad spectrum of social sciences, medicine, science and engineering. The underlying message is that locality is important and measuring local relationships is vital to understanding spatial processes. 'Stewart Fotheringham and his colleagues have produced a book that will be widely used by geographers and others interested in spatial analysis. Geographically weighted regression is an important method, and the authors have developed and explained it well.' Peter Rogerson, Department of Geography, University at Buffalo, USA 'The realisation that almost any statistic can be made 'local', and that mapping the results almost always leads to greater insight is powering a revolution in spatial analysis. In particular, the localisation of standard regression models, or GWR, has led to important and powerful insights. This book, written by the team that has done most to develop it, makes this approach accessible for the first time under a single cover. It should be required reading for anyone involved with the analysis of spatially referenced data.' David Unwin, School of Geography, Birkbeck College London

AB  - Insufficient attention has been given to hotel-room-price attributions and its mechanism in the lodging research field till now. This article examines how site and situation factors differently affect lodging industry and room prices. Comparative analysis of four hedonic price models has been conducted to investigate how these attributions influence room price of Beijing's hotels above star three. Spatial autocorrelation in hotel prices and in hedonic room price equation residuals were analyzed in this research too. Some conclusions can be found and summarized: according to the estimated results, for specific locales, the results expressed in a global model might be inaccurate. The fitting coefficient of geographically weighted regression demonstrates the importance of going beyond the global modeling framework when incorporating geographically weighted regression into hedonic price model. At last, an innovative method for determining the influence of a hotel's attributes at market rates on its' values, or implicit prices was put forward by the authors. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR), as a useful method for exploring spatial nonstationarity of a regression relationship, has been applied to a variety of areas. In this method a spatially varying coefficient model is locally calibrated and the spatial-variation patterns of the locally estimated regression coefficients are taken as the main evidence of spatial nonstationarity for the underlying data-generating processes. Therefore, the validity of the analysis results drawn by GWR is closely dependent on the accuracy between the underlying coefficients and their estimates. Motivated by the local polynomial-modelling technique in statistics, we propose a local linear-based GWR for the spatially varying coefficient models, in which the coefficients are locally expanded as linear functions of the spatial coordinates and then estimated by the weighted least-squares procedure. Some theoretical and numerical comparisons with GWR are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve GWR, not only in goodness-of-fit of the whole regression function but also in reducing bias of the coefficient estimates.

AB  - A mixed, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is useful in the situation where certain explanatory variables influencing the response are global while others are local. Undoubtedly, how to identify these two types of the explanatory variables is essential for building such a model. Nevertheless, It seems that there has not been a formal way to achieve this task. Based on some work on the GWR technique and the distribution theory of quadratic forms in normal variables, a statistical test approach is suggested here to identify a mixed GWR model. Then, this note mainly focuses on simulation studies to examine the performance of the test and to provide some guidelines for performing the test in practice. The simulation studies demonstrate that the test works quite well and provides a feasible way to choose an appropriate mixed GWR model for a given data set.

AB  - Interaction terms are constructed with georeferenced attribute variables and spatial filter eigenvectors, and then used to compute geographically varying regression coefficients. These coefficients, which are analogous to geographically weighted regression (GWR) coefficients, display preferable properties, and this specification is used to critique selected features of GWR. Comparisons are illustrated with the Georgia data appearing in the standard GWR tutorial.

AB  - The present study uses a local regression approach for estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in a tropical rainforest area with highly diverse terrain conditions from remote sensing-based multi-spectral vegetation indices (VI). By incorporating altitudinal effects into the spatial weighting matrices of the common geographically weighted regression (GWR), an extended GWR model, geographically and altitudinal weighted regression (GAWR), has been developed to deal with both spatial (horizontal) and altitudinal (vertical) non-stationarity in the data set. Unlike the common GWR model, the presented GAWR approach captures both horizontal and altitudinal drifts in the relationships between aboveground biomass and remote sensing data. In order to test its improved performance, the GAWR method was compared with the traditional GWR technique and global ordinary least squares regression (OLS) in a region of mountainous tropical rainforest in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The relationships between AGB and VIs were found to be significantly spatially variable. The results showed that there were substantial benefits in capturing both horizontal and vertical non-stationarity simultaneously. The GAWR method significantly improved AGB prediction in all simulations relative to both the traditional GWR and OLS methods, as indicated by accuracy and precision statistics. From the results of empirical tests, it seems proper to say that for this data set, the GAWR model is better than the traditional GWR model. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to explore the spatial variability in the strength of the relationship between public transit use for home-based work (HBW) trip purposes and an array of potential transit use predictors. The transit use predictors considered include demographics and socioeconomics, land use, transit supply and quality, and pedestrian environment. The best predictors identified through model estimation include two global variables (regional accessibility of employment and percentage of households with no car) and three local variables (employment density, average number of cars in households with children, and percentage of the population who are black). The models were estimated on the basis of the 2000 Census Transportation Planning Package data for Broward County, Florida. Model testing indicates the GWR model has improved accuracy in predicting transit use for HBW purposes over linear regression models. The GWR model also indicates that the effects of the independent variables on transit use vary across space. The research points to future research to explore different model structures within a geographic area.

AB  - Present methodological research on geographically weighted regression (GWR) focuses primarily on extensions of the basic GWR model, while ignoring well-established diagnostics tests commonly used in standard global regression analysis. This paper investigates multicollinearity issues surrounding the local GWR coefficients at a single location and the overall correlation between GWR coefficients associated with two different exogenous variables. Results indicate that the local regression coefficients are potentially collinear even if the underlying exogenous variables in the data generating process are uncorrelated. Based on these findings, applied GWR research should practice caution in substantively interpreting the spatial patterns of local GWR coefficients. An empirical disease-mapping example is used to motivate the GWR multicollinearity problem. Controlled experiments are performed to systematically explore coefficient dependency issues in GWR. These experiments specify global models that use eigenvectors from a spatial link matrix as exogenous variables.

AB  - This study deals with the issue of extreme coefficients in geographically weighted regression (GWR) and their effects on mapping coefficients using three datasets with different spatial resolutions. We found that although GWR yields extreme coefficients regardless of the resolution of the dataset or types of kernel function: (1) GWR tends to generate extreme coefficients for less spatially dense datasets; (2) coefficient maps based on polygon data representing aggregated areal units are more sensitive to extreme coefficients; and (3) coefficient maps using bandwidths generated by a fixed calibration procedure are more vulnerable to the extreme coefficients than adaptive calibration.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression and the expansion method are two statistical techniques which can be used to examine the spatial variability of regression results across a region and so inform on the presence of spatial nonstationarity. Rather than accept one set of 'global' regression results, both techniques allow the possibility of producing 'local' regression results from any point within the region so that the output from the analysis is a set of mappable statistics which denote local relationships. Within the paper, the application of each technique to a set of health data from northeast England is compared. Geographically weighted regression is shown to produce more informative results regarding parameter variation over space.

Population segregation was measured with a local segregation index Di based on the theory of the index of dissimilarity. Remote sensing information was extracted from a Landsat ETM+ image through spectral mixture analysis, unsupervised classification, and texture analysis. Global ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) analyses were applied to explore the relationships between population segregation and remote sensing variables. Results indicate that remote sensing information has the potential to increase our under- understanding of socio-cultural issues such as population segregation. standing

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is drawing attention as a statistical method to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable. Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset.

AB  - Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local spatial statistical technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity. Previous approaches to mapping the results of GWR have primarily employed an equal step classification and sequential no-hue colour scheme for choropleth mapping of parameter estimates. This cartographic approach may hinder the exploration of spatial nonstationarity by inadequately illustrating the spatial distribution of the sign, magnitude, and significance of the influence of each explanatory variable on the dependent variable. Approaches for improving mapping of the results of GWR are illustrated using a case study analysis of population densitymedian home value relationships in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. These approaches employ data classification schemes informed by the (nonspatial) data distribution, diverging colour schemes, and bivariate choropleth mapping.

AB  - Spatial nonstationarity is a condition in which a simple ‚Äòglobal‚Äù model cannot explain the relationships between some sets of variables. The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geogra hically weighted regression, model which allows diferent relationships to exist at diferent points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is intro- duced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigatin the null hypothesis that the data my be described by a global model rat er than a which attempts to capture this variation by Cali E rating a multiple regression non-stationa y one and also for testing whether individual regression coefi- cients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a data set from the 1991 U. K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and mule unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended

This study utilized a cross-sectional design to examine the relationships among minority status, median household income, population density, commercial land use, and location of tobacco outlets at the census tract level in Polk County, Iowa. Using geographically weighted regression, this study re-examines one previously carried out in the same location by Schneider et al. (Prevention Science 6: 319-325, 2005). Contrary to that and some other previous studies, this research found no relationship between tobacco outlet density and percent Hispanic, and found a negative relationship with regard to two variables-that of being African American and median household income. Positive significant relationships were found with population density and land use.

AB  - The spatial heterogeneity of multivariate relationships between tree growth and diameter is explored using geographically weighted regression (GWR). GWR attempts to capture spatial variation by calibrating a multiple regression model fitted at each tree in a sample plot, weighting all neighboring trees by a function of distance from the subject tree. GWR produces a set of parameter estimates and model statistics (e.g., model R2) for each tree in the sample plot. It is evident that the GWR model not only predicts individual tree growth better than the traditional ordinary least-squares model, but also provides useful information on the nature of the growth variation caused by neighboring competitors and surrounding environmental factors. The parameter estimates and model statistics of the GWR model can be mapped using visualization tools, such as geographic information systems (GIS), to illustrate local spatial variation in the regression relationship under study. Consequently, the influence of microsite variation, competition status, growth potential, and the impacts of management activities on trees can be evaluated, tested, modeled, and readily visualized. GWR is a useful tool that provides much more information on spatial relationships to assist in model development and further our understanding of spatial processes.

AB  - Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is a method of spatial statistical analysis used to explore geographical differences in the effect of one or more predictor variables upon a response variable. However, as a form of local analysis, it does not scale well to (especially) large data sets because of the repeated processes of fitting and then comparing multiple regression surfaces. A solution is to make use of developing grid infrastructures, such as that provided by the National Grid Service (NGS) in the UK, treating GWR as an ‚Äúembarrassing parallel‚Äù problem and building on existing software platforms to provide a bridge between an open source implementation of GWR (in R) and the grid system. To demonstrate the approach, we apply it to a case study of participation in Higher Education, using GWR to detect spatial variation in social, cultural and demographic indicators of participation.

AB  - Despite differences in regional climates, cities world-wide have developed one common characteristic - the urban heat island (UHI). Its magnitude is related to city size, especially under cloudless sky conditions on a regional basis, although individual cities may be impacted by such local factors as proximity to large water bodies or prevailing winds. The UHI pattern in the small city of Ljutomer was examined in order to assess its intensity and morphology and to test the utility of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method in modeling the regression relationships between mean air temperature and related influence factors in this small-scale urban example. Significant differences in mean air temperature between urban and rural areas were measured. It turned out that built-up areas in Ljutomer are on average 1¬∞C warmer than the rural surroundings in winter time. The regression analyses confirmed the important role of local non-stationary explanatory variables - distance to urban area, topographic position index and land-cover diversity - and global stationary variables - building volume per area and northness - in explaining spatial variation in mean air temperature. The relationships between mean air temperature and these five explanatory variables produced an overall model fit of 91%, utilizing the semiparametric GWR method, which was tested on the smallest scale so far published. ¬© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Factors related to geography such as climate, natural resources or waterways often affect human activities. However, traditional approaches such as ordinary least squares (OLS) have limitations in investigating such patterns. Unlike OLS regression, geographically weighted regression (GWR) allows the coefficients of explanatory variables to differ by locality by giving relatively more weight to geographically close observations. GWR depicts spatial patterns. This paper examines the pattern of height and crude death rate in the United States prior to the Civil War by this method. The GWR results show that access to water transportation increased mortality and decreased stature in the food exporting areas of the Midwest, and the opposite pattern appeared in the food importing areas of the Northeast. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is an effective tool for dealing with spatial data relationships with spatial non-stationarity, but there has not any related studies about using GWR to analyze the landslide surface deformation. Based on a typical reservoir-type landslide in Three Gorges Reservoir area of Yangtze River, China, and uses professional monitoring data, to build OLS and GWR model between landslide surface displacement deformation and trigger factors by ArcGIS. Analysis showed that the GWR model has greater R2 value and smaller Akaike information criterion (AIC) value, and the residuals spatial autocorrelation degree can be significantly reduced then the OLS model, what means the GWR model can capture the spatial non-stationarity of independent variables and is more reliable. Moreover, in GWR model, there are coefficient surface maps can show how modeled relationships between surface deformation and its trigger factors vary across the landslide. Overall, the GWR model is suitable for the analysis of landslide surface deformation, although there still need a lot of further in-depth studies. ¬© 2013, EJGE.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the spatially varying impacts of some classical regressors on per capita household income in Spanish provinces. The authors model this distribution following both a traditional global regression and a local analysis with Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Several specifications are compared, being the adaptive bisquare weighting function the more efficient in terms of goodness-of-fit. We test for global and local spatial instability using some F-tests and other statistical measures. We find some evidence of spatial instability in the distribution of this variable in relation to some explanatory variables, which cannot be totally solved by spatial dependence specifications. GWR has revealed as a better specification to model per capita household income. It highlights some facets of the relationship completely hidden in the global results and forces us to ask about questions we would otherwise not have asked. Moreover, the application of GWR can also be of help to further exercises of micro-data spatial prediction.

GWR is based on the non-parametric technique\nof locally weighted regression developed in statistics for curve-fitting\nand smoothing applications, where local regression parameters are\nestimated using subsets of data proximate to a model estimation point\nin variable space. The innovation with GWR is using a subset of data\nproximate to the model calibration location in geographical space\ninstead of variable space. While the emphasis in traditional locally\nweighted regression in statistics has been on curve-fitting, that\nis estimating or predic ting the response variable, GWR has been\npresented as a method to conduct inference on spatially varying relationships,\nin an attempt to extend the original emphasis on prediction to confirmatory\nanalysis (P√°ez and Wheeler 2009).
