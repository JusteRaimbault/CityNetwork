AB  - Providers of public transportation in the 1990s face serious challenges. They must use resources more efficiently than ever. With these challenges in mind, the Indiana Public Transportation Equipment and Facilities Management System (IPTMS) was created as a systematic process for providing information to make informed decisions about transit assets. The main function of the IPTMS is to act as an informational tool to evaluate the state of transit and the condition of transit assets to better plan for investment decisions. The framework and methodologies used in developing the IPTMS are described. This development consists of four parts: development of asset deterioration profiles and condition profile modeling, establishment of threshold performance indicator values, quantitative models that enable full usage of a comprehensive IPTMS prototype simulation model, and guidelines for updating and monitoring the management system. These guidelines will be useful for other agencies, at both the state and individual agency levels, that want to develop a PTMS.

AB  - Over the last decade, a large number of high capital cost transportation projects have been proposed for the New York City Region. Many have resulted from addressing evolving capacity needs, changes in regional demographics and economics, meeting the improvements necessitated by operating century old subway systems and recognizing the impact of moving freight in a dense region. But the catalyst for bringing all of these projects to the attention of the public and all regional agencies was the tragedy of September 11, 2001. While these projects entail massive investments ($50–$60 billion), little analytical work has been carried out to measure the transportation and economic costs and benefits they entail and to categorize them accordingly. Competition among agencies to secure adequate resources to implement any of the desired projects makes such analysis necessary; yet there still remain political, vested economic interests and agency rivalry barriers to achieving this important planning objective. This paper reports the methodological approach taken by these authors for consistent and transparent project evaluation and then presents results from the ranking and prioritizing methodology. The policy underpinnings and implications of the analysis are discussed in a subsequent paper and thus only briefly touched upon here in the concluding section.

AB  - The main objective of this chapter is to address the facility design and location issues in a public bike transportation system. The major decisions in introducing a public bike transportation system include determining the number of bike facilities and their locations. The present chapter considers a case study from city of Vancouver bike transportation system to demonstrate the importance of these decisions through a real world application. The city intends to decide the number and location of bike terminals. Addressing these two decisions is the main focus of the present chapter and the chapter employs linear programming and center of gravity approaches to arrive at the solutions. The chapter also provides a basic introduction to bike facilities and discusses the sustainability benefits of bike transportation mode.

AB  - China's urbanization has accelerated during the era of reform. While there has been real progress in urbanization, the process has also been skewed by several administrative measures designed to foster urbanization and economic growth. According to a popular view, as many as 70 per cent of China's administrative jurisdictions now come under the rule of urban governments. This must be an exaggeration given that many parts of China are still essentially rural. This article examines three measures - turning prefectures into cities (di gai shi), turning counties into cities (xian gai shi), and turning cities and counties into urban districts (xian shi gai qu) - that have contributed to "inflated urbanization." Five propositions budgetary, urbanization, regulatory, organizational streamlining and policy incentive - are discussed to see if the three measures have either originated from or have affected them. We find that while the regulatory observation is relevant only for the measure of xian shi gai qu, the other four propositions are useful, though to varying degrees, for understanding the logic of the changing "city system" in the past two decades.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is, first, to construct a simple model of a city (a metropolitan area) and to calculate in this model how transportation costs vary with city size and, second, to try to examine whether the available data conform to what is expected according to that model. The model is a simplified version of the models that were used in the recent literature in this area Simplifying the basic assumptions makes the model more manageable, which, in turn, enables us to calculate explicitly magnitudes that were not calculated in the more complicated and general models.

AB  - The intelligent city system was presented in this paper to cover the requirement of urban development. Currently, most cities fell into a troubled state with the urban problems, such as traffic, parking, garbage-treatment etc. However, most cities in the world still concentrated on the building of the elementary stage of city informatization. The intelligent city system was centering on knowledge, with advanced information platform and intelligent social service by all latest technology means. In detail, Intelligent City realizes the information collection and management, dynamic inspection and decision-making etc. The paper constructed its concrete building frame, which was composed of Intelligent Basis Level, Intelligent Application Level and Intelligent Decision Support Level. There were also some sub-systems in each level and they interacted with each other. All these levels and sub-systems formed a bigger comprehensive scheme, which had the abilities of self-study, self-balance and self-regulation.

AB  - The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is planning several projects that will have a substantial impact in the transportation network in El Paso. This research project conducted a study of the integration of the El Paso metropolitan transportation system with UTEPs transportation master plan and to develop a synthesis of best practices of transportation systems integration employed by universities from across the country. This research report presents a synthesis of these best practices and documents the lessons learned during the analysis of the UTEP campus found in Report 0-6608-2. The overall goal of the report was to provide guidance on the integration between transportation systems and a university campus master plan. Researchers used a two-pronged approach to document best practices in this report. First, researchers conducted a review of the state-of-the-practice on university campuses around the country. Second, researchers synthesized the lessons learned from the development of the case study analysis of the UTEP campus master plan and its integration with current and planned metropolitan transportation infrastructure, where the integrated application of practices from around the country could be tested.

AB  -  Giving the priority to the development of public transportation is the basic content of the Chinese city transportation development strategy. In recent decades of years, hundreds; of Chinese cities have made public transportation system planning. Some of them even have made the public transportation operation and scheduling optimization. The practice of these cities made it clear that an integrated decision support system for urban public transportation planning and operation is in great of need. This paper brings forward an integrated systematic frame for the needs of Chinese city public transportation planning and operation, and it also makes the structural design for the public transportation database of the integrated system. The system will be of great benefit to improve the public transportation planning and operational level and accelerate the development of public transportation.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - A package of large-scale investments in the transportation infrastructure in the Stockholm metropolitan region is currently being proposed. It contains new investments in the railway and subway systems as well as new links in the road system. This paper deals with the issue of appraising this kind of investment program. One major problem is the lack of a unique standard method, and it is argued that several tools should be used in a practical evaluation of large-scale investments in the transportation system. Four different approaches are presented and related to each other. First, one study uses a network-based mode-split/assignment model with a fixed trip matrix. The second study is complementary, as its aim is to also trace the impacts on the spatial distribution of population and jobs by applying an integrated transportation and land use model. Third, the long-run effects of the investments on regional economic growth are discussed within the framework of regional production functions. Fourth, an alternative approach is used, in which benefits from the investments are assessed through their estimated influence on aggregate land values.

AB  - Under the United States federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, states must implement transportation system management (TSM) tactics in urban areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of using TSM tactics to improve air quality. Based on this assessment, the authors conclude that TSM measures should be effective in eliminating localized carbon monoxide problems, but that such measures are not likely to contribute significantly toward reducing regional oxidant levels. In addition, because most individual TSM tactics can have only marginal impacts on regional motor vehicle emissions, coordinating the planning and implemen- tation of a portfolio of TSM measures will be an essential element of an effective TSM program for improving air quality.

Accordingly, the system provides detailed and easily accessible information on transportation projects in the region, as well as their interrelationships and impacts. By doing so, TELUS enables public-sector agencies to meet organizational, Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, state, and other mandates more effectively. The objectives are accomplished by providing the computer-based capability to analyze, sort, combine, and track transportation projects in or under consideration for a TIP; assessing the interrelationships among significant transportation projects; estimating the regional economic and land use effects of transportation projects; and presenting project information in an easily understood format, including geographic information system formats.

AB  - Ensuring transportation network security is one of the most daunting challenges confronting homeland security agencies today. Significant research has been dedicated to model and analyze the vulnerability of transportation systems, yet notably fewer studies propose specific strategies for deploying defensive technologies to safeguard these systems. The ultimate goal of situational awareness for prevention and rapid response remains largely unaddressed. Wireless sensors and ad hoc networks are widely regarded as a promising approach to monitor systems and enhance their security. Furthermore, the growth in smart phone usage can contribute additional relay nodes to the network connecting the deployed sensors and command center. Such sensor networks offer the potential to detect a terrorist plot before it can be executed, support effective response to emergency events, and dynamically monitor traffic flows to facilitate efficient travel within a city. This paper present a scheme which turn the deployment into a optimization to maximize the weighted coverage, and we demonstrate the approach through the simulation, the result of which clear indicates its effectiveness.

AB  - A modelling approach is used for studying the effects of population vaccination on the epidemic dynamics of a set of n cities interconnected by a complex transportation network. The model is based on a sophisticated mover-stayer formulation of inter-city population migration, upon which is included the classical SIS dynamics of disease transmission which operates within each city. Our analysis studies the stability properties of the Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) of the full n-city system in terms of the reproductive number R(0). Should vaccination reduce R(0) below unity, the disease will be eradicated in all n-cities. We determine the precise conditions for which this occurs, and show that disease eradication by vaccination depend on the transportation structure of the migration network in a very direct manner. Several concrete examples are presented and discussed, and some counter-intuitive results found.

AB  - This paper reports results from an analysis of the relationship between the structure of the city-to-city network of global airline passenger flows and the interstate world system. While many scholars suggest that the broader parameters of the world system structure the urban hierarchy embedded within or articulated to it, others argue that the urban hierarchy is decoupling from the world system. The analyses show that there has been some modest convergence in the distribution of power in the world city system. Moreover, they suggest that the mechanism for this convergence is the upward mobility of cities located in the semi-periphery and the east Asian region. The paper closes by considering the implication of these findings for a larger understanding of the relationship between globalisation, the structure of the world city system and its articulation with the world system.

The system was initially designed as a robotic wheelchair for elderly and disabled people. Hence the naming MAid (Mobility Aid for Elderly and Disabled People). One of MAid’s core functions is deliberative autonmous locomotion in rapidly changing, large-scale environments, such as shop- ping malls or concourses of airports or railway stations, where tens or hundreds of people and objects are moving around. MAid’s performance was tested in the central station of Ulm, Germany, during rush-hour, and in the exhibition halls of the Hannover Messe ’98, the biggest in- dustrial fair worldwide. Meanwhile, MAid has survived more than 48 hours of testing in those environments. MAid navigation and control system is currently being extended such that it could be used as a people taxi in airports, for example.

Particularly, 3D building model data are required in a wide range of areas such as urban planning, environmental protection, real estate management and emergency response. At the same time, the development of Web service technologies allows the possibility of the widely distributed 3D geospatial data on the web. 3D city building model with its related information is an important part in the construction of a digital city system, and has become a staple resource on the web nowadays. In view of the hierarchical representation of a 3D building model, an abstract of a 3D building model based on structure details is studied, and a novel representation approach named 3D transparent building hierarchical model is presented in this paper. This approach fully uses both the existing 3D modeling technologies and CAD constructing mapping data. By the spatial relationship description, structural components inside a building can be represented and integrated as hierarchical models in a unified 3D space. In addition, based on the characteristics of the 3D building model data, a service-oriented architecture and Web service technologies for 3D city building models are discussed. The aim of the approach is that 3D city building models can be used as a kind of data resource service on the web, and can also exist independently in various different web applications. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag 2010.

AB  - Much of the research on coordinated transportation and land use methods such as Transit Oriented Development (TOD) has focused on the developed world, particularly the United States. This paper examines the opportunities and challenges for such policies in the developing world, and argues that these policies might have greater benefits in the developing world than in the developed world. Mexico City is used as a case study. In the developing world, where cities are growing rapidly and car ownership is still low, TOD provides an opportunity to design the urban form to be transit-oriented. Low-income people can thus be served by cheaper high capacity transit, spend less of their income on transportation and have better access to jobs. They will make fewer and shorter trips by informal low capacity transit, reducing congestion and pollution. In the long term, TOD may slow down motorization and mitigate its effects. Mexico City faces a crisis of mobility, environment and equity. However, it has many of the prerequisites for TOD. It has the densities, an extensive Metro system, and metropolitan planning organizations. Opportunities for coordinated transportation and land use planning there include station area development, downtown redevelopment, real estate development along a proposed suburban rail line, and a policy of building new affordable housing within walking distance of high capacity transit. The greater the geographical scope of each option, the more government involvement is required, and the larger its potential positive impact. An estimate of environmental benefits is made.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

We relate each location’s urban chances to its physical, first nature, geography characteristics, and develop a novel empirical strategy to assess how the existing urban system surrounding each location (second nature geography) determines its urban prospects. First nature geography is the dominant determinant of city location until the sixteenth century. Second nature geography becomes important from the seventeenth century onwards, in a way that corresponds closely to predictions from new economic geography theory.

On the basis of an in-depth analysis of the demand and supply sides of the bimodal transportation system, the mode choice equilibrium of travelers along the continuum corridor is first presented and formulated as an equivalent variational inequality problem. The solution properties of the bimodal continuum equilibrium formulation are analytically explored. Two models, which account for different infrastructure/system regulatory regimes (public and private), are then proposed. In the public regulatory model, the road toll location and charge level are simultaneously optimized together with the bus service fare and frequency. In the private regulatory model, the fare and frequency of bus services, which are operated by a profit-driven private operator, are optimized for exogenously given toll pricing schemes. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the application of the proposed models. Sensitivity analysis of residential/household distribution along the corridor is carried out together with a comparison of four different toll pricing schemes (no toll, first best, distance based, and location based). Insightful findings are reported on the interrelationships among modal competition, market regulatory regimes, toll pricing schemes, and urban configurations as well as their implications in practice. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  - The research constitutes the first effort to test the claim found in the world city theoretical literature that, as world cities strengthen ties with each other, their linkages with their countries' hinterlands and national urban systems will weaken. This research offers a more nuanced exploration of this hypothesis by taking into account variation in the nature of the state across countries in which world cities are located as well as the source of global capital in the world cities. Specifically, the research reported here suggests that three types of world cities-market-centred bourgeois world cities (MWC), state-centred political bureaucratic world cities (SWC) and dual-role world cities (DWC)-entail different deterritorialisation outcomes. Three countries that have prototypical global cities-Japan (SWC), China (DWC) and the US (MWC) are compared, applying longitudinal network modelling to relational data on national city networks. From 1993 to 2007, more globally connected MWCs weakened their national ties. In contrast, higher global status has no significant effect on the integration of SWCs or DWCs with their national urban systems. This indicates that the type of state, but not the source of capital, conditions whether the world city will deterritorialise vis-A-vis its national city system.

AB  - The rapid growth in urbanization and motorization generally contributes to an urban transportation system that is economically, environmentally and socially unsustainable. The result has been a relentless increase in traffic congestion. Road congestion pricing has been proposed many times as an economic measure to fight congestion in urban traffic, but has not seen widespread use in practice because of Some potential impacts of road pricing remain unknown. The paper first reviews the concept of sustainable transportation system, which should meet the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice collectively. And then, based on the characteristics of sustainable transportation system, how congestion pricing can contribute to economic growth, environmental protection and social justice is examined. Examination result shows that congestion pricing is a powerful way to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation system.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - Giving the priority to the development of public transportation is the basic content of the Chinese city transportation development strategy. In recent decades of years, hundreds; of Chinese cities have made public transportation system planning. Some of them even have made the public transportation operation and scheduling optimization. The practice of these cities made it clear that an integrated decision support system for urban public transportation planning and operation is in great of need. This paper brings forward an integrated systematic frame for the needs of Chinese city public transportation planning and operation, and it also makes the structural design for the public transportation database of the integrated system. The system will be of great benefit to improve the public transportation planning and operational level and accelerate the development of public transportation.

AB  - The phenomenon of globalization has renewed interest in thinking about the place & role of cities in the international system. Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (& their residents) has become increasingly tied to their position in international flows of investment & trade. While some have suggested the appropriateness of network techniques for the study of the global urban system, few have effectively realized their application. Utilizing data on the branch locations of the world's 500 largest multinational enterprises (MNEs) in 1981 & 2000, we employ network analytic techniques to examine change in the structure of the world city system. First, we evaluate the more than 3000 cities that are knit together in the MNE-generated city system in terms of three measures of point centrality (viz., degree, betweenness, & closeness) at both time points. Second, we use these measures to answer a series of questions regarding the development of the world city system: (1) How extensively has the structure of the world city system been altered across the era of globalization? (2) Have power & prestige in the world city system grown more concentrated? (3) Have cities been decoupled from "traditional" political geography in the course of globalization? In answering these questions, we trace out the changing structure of the world city system & address key concerns in the literature regarding its evolution.

AB  - The paper argues that systems analysis provides an invaluable frame for many aspects of urban studies. Two uses of the systems approach are identified. First, there is the use of the approach to conceptualize the phenomenon of study such that the researcher's emphasis is on the nature of the interrelationships of the objects and the attributes of the system of interest on the one hand, and the study of subsystems of interest within an interacting whole, on the other. Secondly, there is the use of the systems approach to generate appropriate methodological tools for the analysis and description of urban spatial and functional structure. For these uses of the system approach, the concept of entropy, introduced from both thermodynamics and information theory, plays a significant role. Empirically, the concept is used to generate interaction patterns of the journey to work subsystem in Jos, Benue Plateau State, Nigeria, while certain indices of information theory entropy are used to unravel the nature and structure of these flows or movements of people. It emerges that the concept of entropy can be used in studies of urban spatial structure as an integrating concept provided that our terms are defined explicitly and unambiguously. © 1976.

The growth of the city system exhibits four stages that are evident from our quantitative analysis of the convergence of population in large cities and qualitative analysis of historical socioeconomic and technological developments. The decadal city size distributions in the aggregate evolve with a persistent pattern while individual cities over time shift positions in the urban hierarchy as the result of adapting or passing growth opportunities in infrastructure innovations, economic change, and industrial transformations. These decadal city size distributions exhibit persistent discontinuities that mainly occur in the upper and lower tails. The observed patterns and discontinuities are indicative of the stability and resilience of a complex adaptive system of cities. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The UK government maintains a 1km resolution emissions inventory based on a bottom-up methodology by which a validation is possible. The UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory data are used to assess at what geographic scale the new E-PRTR data might be most useful.

AB  - For the past 20 years, researches using the lens of world system theory (and other global political economy perspectives) have come to a better understanding of many of the anomalies in urbanisation patterns across more and less developed countries that had befuddled researchers whose assumptions left out global sources of social change. Recently this line of research has moved beyond regarding cities as mere objects of global forces, also theorising about their importance as lynchpins in the spatial organisation of the world economy. In this paper we review some of the scholarship that emphasises large cities’ roles as important modes of production, consumption, exchange and control at the global level; we develop the argument that systematic linkages - economic, cultural, political or social-relational - among global cities are likely to reveal the spatial organisation of the world-system; we review our position that formal network analysis provides a most promising methodological framework for analysing and mapping global intercity linkages; and we present a map of the current world city system based on our network analysis of recent air travel among many of the world’s great cities. We point out that our analysis is very preliminary and provides only a rough chart of the world city system at one point in time, and the data requirements for more detailed world city system maps for several periods of time are imposing, to say the least. Nevertheless, such a project holds the promise of revealing much about the spatial structure of our world system, how it has changed; how it is likely to change in the future; and how cities’ populations are affected by these changes. Completing the project will probably require collaboration among researchers in different countries.

AB  - Cargo shipments are subject to hijack, theft, or tampering. Furthermore, cargo shipments are at risk of being used to transport contraband, potentially resulting in fines to shippers. The Transportation Security Sensor Network (TSSN), which is based on open software systems and service-oriented architecture principles, has been developed to mitigate these risks. Using commercial off-the-shelf hardware, the TSSN can detect and report events that are relevant to appropriate decision makers. However, field testing is required to validate the system architecture and to determine if the system can provide timely event notification. Field experiments were conducted to assess the TSSN's suitability to monitor rail-borne cargo. Log files were collected from these experiments and were postprocessed. We present the TSSN architecture and results of field experiments, including the time taken to report events using the TSSN and the interaction between various components of the TSSN. These results show that the TSSN architecture can be used to monitor rail-borne cargo.

AB  - The results of the performed screening study indicates that it is possible to transport CO2 over large distances within a reasonable unit cost. It is evident that the effect of large scale solutions to reduce unit costs are substantial. The transportation unit cost for a fully utilized large diameter pipeline over 1500 kilometers is estimated at approximately 6$ per tonne, while transportation through a 16 inch pipeline, corresponding to CO2 from a single 1000 MW gas fired power station, over the same distance, is approximately 42$ per tonne. The transportation cost should be compared with carbon tax of 50$ per tonne CO2 in force in Norway and the proposed EC energy / carbon tax of 10 $ per barrel of oil, which is equivalent to approximately 24 $ per tonne CO2. Large diameter pipelines require large investments and multilateral agreement. Therefore, the possibilities to establish an integrated large scale CO2 transportation system across country borders and continents is a possibility, but the perspective is long term. Although an integrated large scale CO2 transportation system is not likely to appear in our decade or even in the next two or three, it may turn out to be the chosen solution for the mid 21th Century if we are entering a greenhouse driven future.

The historical background is outlined. There has been a huge increase in rural population; there are both traditional and colonial city systems; there have been a number of planning strategies since 1949. China's level of urbanization is low: the rank order and the regional distribution of cities is anomalous. Many cities have developed and rural towns may soon greatly increase in size. There are fewer towns than in 1949. Thus city structure is in a state of flux, and this is not recorded in the statistics. -D.J.Davis

AB  - City provides an accessible yet critical introduction to one of the key ideas in human geography. Always at the heart of discussions in social theory, the definition and specification of the city nonetheless remains elusive. In this volume, Phil Hubbard locates the concept of the city within current traditions of social thought, providing a basis for understand- ing its varying usages and meanings through a critical discussion of the contribution of major theories and thinkers. This book thus offers a distinctive and timely intervention in debates in urban theory by suggesting new ways that students and scholars in sociology, geography, urban studies, planning and politics can make sense of the city. Written in a lively and accessible style, the individual chapters of City offer a thematic overview of some important ways of approaching cities, whether as imagined realms, lived-in places, networks of association or spaces of flow. Situating these traditions within the rich heritage of urban studies and urban sociology, the book develops the argument that none of these approaches, when taken alone, helps us grasp the specificity of the urban, but that each is vital for grasping the materiality of cities.The book thus spells out the case for a renewed urban geography, suggesting that it is only by combining these different ways of approaching the city that we can begin to understand the relational materiality of urban life.

The City Beautiful aesthetic approach to conceiving urban circulation networks was an important and often overlooked contribution to transportation planning, and improving urban transportation was an important goal for City Beautiful reformers. A review of historical planning documents and project descriptions suggests that civic leaders' approaches to improving urban circulation during the City Beautiful era are enduring contributions of the movement's integrated approach to land use and transportation planning and its desire to transform cities into more beautiful places.

With these challenges in mind, the Indiana Public Transportation Equipment and Facilities Management System (IPTMS) was created as a systematic process for providing information to make informed decisions about transit assets. The main function of the IPTMS is to act as an informational tool to evaluate the state of transit and the condition of transit assets to better plan for investment decisions. The framework and methodologies used in developing the IPTMS are described. This development consists of four parts: development of asset deterioration profiles and condition profile modeling, establishment of threshold performance indicator values, quantitative models that enable full usage of a comprehensive IPTMS prototype simulation model, and guidelines for updating and monitoring the management system. These guidelines will be useful for other agencies, at both the state and individual agency levels, that want to develop a PTMS.

AB  - A waste-heat transportation system that uses a phase change material (PCM) - the so-called trans-heat (TH) system - is considerably attractive from the viewpoint of saving energy because manufacturing industries such as the steelmaking industry continue to emit high-temperature waste heat. The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility of the TH system from three viewpoints - energy requirement, exergy loss and CO2 emissions-which affect the heat source and heat storage materials in the TH system. The TH system, which recovers waste heat and supplies hot or cold water, is comparatively evaluated under reasonable assumptions such as the temperature of the waste heat is 200°C and that of the supplied water is 50°C or 7°C, the transportation distance is 20 km and the laden weight of the container is 2.4·104 kg (weight of the PCM = 1.75·104 kg; weight of the heat transfer oil = 2.5 · 103 kg). The following results are obtained: The latent heat of erythritol supplies the largest amount of heat, 5.31 GJ at 50°C, in the TH systems. For supplying hot water at 50°C, the energy requirement of the TH system with erythritol is 7.7%, exergy loss is 8.1 % and CO2 emission is 20.2 % as compared to those of the conventional system with kerosene on site. For supplying cold water at 7°C, the energy requirement of the TH system with erythritol is 12.0%, exergy loss is 12.0% and CO2 emission is 26.6% as compared to those of a conventional absorption chiller that uses natural gas as the heat source. © 2008 ISIJ.

Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - The majority of comparisons between state transportation systems do not control for characteristics that may vary greatly between states (e.g., vehicle miles traveled). A shortcoming of such analyses is that a state's individual characteristics can be highly influential in determining how transportation policy is set and funds are spent. The purpose of this paper is to extend previous efforts to create groups of similar peer states by developing a new methodological framework that incorporates demographic, temporal, and locational variability into the peer group delineations. We collected historical data for 42 variables on transportation infrastructure, population, economy, growth, topography and weather. To examine trends before and after the passage of ISTEA we gathered data over two time periods: 1985 through 1990 and 1995 through 2000. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we reduced variables into seven components, and then statistically clustered states into peer groups for each time period based on the components and the remaining variables. We identified a range of cluster solutions and demonstrate how cluster statistics help to describe the contextual basis behind the peer grouping. The results of this study are to provide government agencies, researchers and the public with a systematic methodological framework for identifying peer states that reflect similar attributes contributing to the development and maintenance of state transportation systems.

AB  -  A system platform for location-based entertainment applications of mobile phones is described. With GPS and electronic compasses, some of today's mobile phones have rich functions for such entertainment as role playing games, treasure hunting, sightseeing with virtual information, etc. Our system model can manage virtual worlds that can be overlaid onto the real world with regard to location (latitude and longitude). Each virtual world is a set of virtual architectural objects and virtual creatures. Virtual creatures are active objects that can interact with users. In this paper, browser-based and BREW-based systems for virtual worlds are described. BREW is an efficient software platform for mobile phones. It enables autonomous location sensing and automatic redrawing, which will solve most of the problems found in evaluation sessions of the browser-based version.

AB  - Large scale systems with some social relevance present major challenges to the modern system engineer. The coordination of future transportation systems both on a national and an urban scale is among the more important of these. A number of citizens feel that reorganizing urban life in the United States is a fitting and pressing national goal for the next several decades and reorganizing the urban transportation segment is an essential feature of urban planning. A systems study of the city will be discussed and a number of activities basic to a city system model will be proposed. Transportation will be one of these elements.

AB  - Two aspects - socioeconomic and physical - of city systems in Africa are considered here in relation to drought monitoring and strategies required for formulating adequate responses to the impact of drought. The two principal socioeconomic factors which contribute to the problem of drought are the policy bias of African countries towards urban areas and the role of external factors. With respect to physical factors, the author draws attention to the results of studies on urban inadvertent rainfall and suggests that mesoscale rainfall forecasters could do more accurate work by incorporating the effect of urban climate in their models. In the domain of water resources management and agricultural development, moreover, the development of urban agriculture could be encouraged downwind. Bibliogr., sum.

AB  -  Bicycles offer extremely efficient, pollution-free transportation for urban and suburban areas, and the addition of electric drive eliminates the sweat, extends the range and helps older riders. However, we must recognize the problems that restrict ridership to a hardy few. For the rider, these include danger from autos, stop and go driving on streets not designed and maintained for skinny tires, and bad weather. And for the local government, bike lanes take up valuable space without providing revenue. Presented here is a concept of an elevated, enclosed bicycle transportation system that would enable the electric bicycle to become an acceptable form of transportation for the general public, and put a major dent in pollution and dependence on foreign oil. The cost of constructing a basic system is presented, along with the cost of climate control of an operating system.

AB  - Highway maintenance scheduling is a complex optimization problem and imposes a challenge for GIS-T research. In this paper, a new approach was put forward to determining the optimal set of alternatives for highway infrastructure facilities by using ant colony algorithm and GIS. In the proposed approach, GIS was used to analyze traffic flux, toll and maintenance time of each highway segment. Meanwhile, an ant colony algorithm was applied to resolve the computational complexity of multi-objective large-size scheduling optimization problems. Experiments were performed in national highways in the Hubei province by the proposed method. The application illustrated the feasibility, efficiency, and capability of coupling ant algorithm and geography information system transportation for multi-objective expressway maintenance planning optimization.
