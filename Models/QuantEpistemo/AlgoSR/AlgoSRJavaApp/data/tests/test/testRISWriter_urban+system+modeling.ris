AB  - The authors address the need for training dispatchers in the operation of power systems where it involves managing large water systems. The problem formulation and implementation of water system modeling for dispatcher training simulators (DTSs) are presented. The method systematically builds the water network descriptions. The model periodically calculates the water system flows, storage values, and currently available hydro generation capacities. The model is controllable by the instructor and provides the simulated telemetry of water system data to the control center functions in the DTS. The water system modeling enhances the power system modeling subsystem of the DTS. The method is validated on a large water system and power system data. The results and the benefits of water system modeling are discussed

However, operation system involves so many ingredients and relations that traditional modeling methods based on reductive theory can't understand the operation rules from the views of the whole thing very well. Complex Network theory affords a new measure of complex system modeling from the point of whole network. Paper based on complex network theory, introduce weight and direction network into the OODA operation theory. Therefore, we can study the model of the operation system. Much more, we also give out the analysis result of the operation system complex network model. It can provide a reference meaning for the study of the operation system in the whole point.

AB  - Urban system is the spatial reflection of the inner-deep social economic movement. New economic circum- stances not only make the evolution of urban system present one brand-new landscape, but also put forward a new subject for planning of urban system. This article analyzes the properties of the traditional economic process and its essential ef- fect on urban system; it makes a complete survey on the properties of new economic circumstances and its effect on re-forming of urban system; the complicated influential process and result are concluded into the aspects, such as new growth motive force, new economic organization, new location factor and new spatial phenomenon, and its inner effect mechanism is shown as well. In this article, the change process of urban system space is explained in four aspects: ( 1 ) dissimulation in the process of spatial agglomeration and diffusion; (2) change of "center-periphery "effect; (3) accelera- tion growth of axial regions; (4) re-forming of the world and regional urban system. Based on the above theoretical analy- sis and the properties & requests of new economic circumstances, this article finally puts forward four philosophies empha- sized by urban system planning, and forms the new frame for drawing-up of urban system planning.

Urban centres have moved up and down the urban hierarchy, and the delineation of urban spheres of influence for the top levels of the urban hierarchy in 1966, 1971 and 1981 indicates that hinterlands have also changed. New centres in the upper tiers of the hierarchy developed in areas where the hinterlands of the older centres in that tier had previously converged. The analysis of such spheres of influences and urban attraction over time can be used as an important aid for a variety of types of government planning.

AB  - With the recent trend to model driven engineering a common understanding of basic notions such as ``model'' and ``metamodel'' becomes a pivotal issue. Even though these notions have been in widespread use for quite a while, there is still little consensus about when exactly it is appropriate to use them. The aim of this article is to start establishing a consensus about generally acceptable terminology. Its main contributions are the distinction between two fundamentally different kinds of model roles, i.e. ``token model'' versus ``type model'' (The terms ``type'' and ``token'' have been introduced by C.S. Peirce, 1839--1914.), a formal notion of ``metaness'', and the consideration of ``generalization'' as yet another basic relationship between models. In particular, the recognition of the fundamental difference between the above mentioned two kinds of model roles is crucial in order to enable communication among the model driven engineering community that is free of both unnoticed misunderstandings and unnecessary disagreement.

AB  - The identification of “critical drainage areas” to quantify “hotspot” flood and pollution risks associated with extreme event urban surface runoff is central to Stormwater Management Plans and Water Framework Directive catchment planning. An innovative geographic information system-based 1D–2D modeling analysis coupled with a drainage assessment tool is described which addresses this methodological requirement. The modeling approach further integrates a sustainable urban drainage system (SUDS) tool called SUDSLOC to provide a stakeholder-friendly surface water management framework. The modeling approach is illustrated by reference to two small urban catchments within the cities of Birmingham and Coventry in the Midlands region of England and the benefits of utilizing ground-based “light detection and ranging” survey to build the surface micro-topography are demonstrated. The performance effectiveness of the selected SUDS controls was explored and the utility of the graphical animated outputs are discussed. Whilst the implemented SUDS controls exhibit substantial reductions (>57%) in total discharge volumes for storms up to 1:30 year return periods, there are very limited volumetric reductions for storm events exceeding this return period.

An attempt is made here to examine the spatial structure of this sector in terms of the urban system, drawing on the principles of central-place theory, the limitations and applicability of which are considered. This is followed by a discussion of the salient features of financial services within the overall urban system. After describing the differentiation of financial services in frequency terms, the hierarchical structure of the UK urban system is outlined. These two aspects are then related, in order to demonstrate the ordered nature of the spatial structure of financial services.

AB  - In this paper, we study the hitherto unexplored evolution of the size distribution of 185 functionally defined urban areas in Brazil between 1907 and 2008. We apply the traditional power law and the Gabaix–Ibragimov improved estimation method. We find that the power parameter of the size distribution of the 100 largest urban areas increases towards unity, that is, the rank-size rule. Seventeen thousand and twenty cointegration tests of pairwise non-stationary growth paths of cities point to evidence of a common stochastic trend that strengthens throughout the century. Thus, while Zipf's law and Gibrat's law did not formally hold in Brazil's past, these laws are becoming steadily more appropriate descriptions of Brazil's increasingly unequal size distribution of cities.

treating it as a new paradigm of fuzzy system modeling and analysis.
This form of modeling is oriented towards developing individual (local)
fuzzy models for specific modeling landmarks (expressed as fuzzy sets)
and determining the essential logical relationships between these local
models. The models themselves are implemented in the form of logic
processors being regarded as specialized fuzzy neural networks. The
interaction between the processors is developed either in an inhibitory
or excitatory way. In more descriptive way, the distributed model can be
sought as a collection of fuzzy finite state machines with their
individual local first or higher order memories. It is also clarified
how the concept of distributed modeling narrows down a gap between
purely numerical (quantitative) models and the qualitative ones
originated within the realm of artificial intelligence. The overall
architecture of distributed modeling is discussed along with the
detailed learning schemes. The results of extensive simulation
experiments are provided as well

AB  - To support hyperspectral sensor system design and parameter trade-off investigations, Lincoln Laboratory has developed an analytical end-to-end model that forecasts remote sensing system performance. The model uses statistical descriptions of scene class reflectances and transforms them to account for the effects of the atmosphere, the sensor, and any processing operations. System-performance metrics can then be calculated on the basis of these transformed statistics. The model divides a remote sensing system into three main components: the scene, the sensor, and the processing algorithms. Scene effects modeled include the solar illumination, atmospheric transmittance, shade effects, adjacency effects, and overcast clouds. Modeled sensor effects include radiometric noise sources, such as shot noise, thermal noise, detector readout noise, quantization noise, and relative calibration error. The processing component includes atmospheric compensation, various linear transformations, and a number of operators used to obtain detection probabilities. Models have been developed for several imaging spectrometers, including the airborne Hyperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experiment (HYDICE) instrument, which covers the reflective solar spectral region from 0.4 to 2.5 μm. This article presents the theory and operation of the model, and provides example parameter trade studies to show the utility of the model for system design and sensor operation applications.

AB  - The popular concept of a &#x201C;Smart Grid&#x201D; involves an integration of novel information and communications technologies across an evolving electricity system spanning generation, transmission, distribution and customer networks. For example, distributed generation, energy efficiency, and demand-side management will enable and affect many changes in the electric grid. Drivers for an advanced grid include stresses on the existing system, the attractiveness of new capabilities enabled by technology, and the influence of economic, environmental and security concerns. The rate and form with which these technologies will diffuse are open questions. While there already exists a large body of research which considers the technical potential and local impact of specific &#x201C;smart&#x201D; changes to the grid, holistic studies are also needed to assess some of the complex and interrelated effects of adoption across this vast technology set. As part of a larger initiative, a system dynamics model was developed emphasizing the electrical distribution system in an urban context. The model allows for simulation of a wide range of scenarios in order to analyze the diffusion and impact of compound technological changes on the electrical distribution system. For the purposes of this paper we evaluated subsidization policies for select novel technologies and services. This allowed for the identification of a subset of subsidization targets that in our simulation were more effective than others at accelerating the development of a smart distribution system. Our results are discussed within the context of the assumptions and limitations of the model, which suggest directions for future research.

In nineteenth century Victoria, communications technologies which were government directed and owned were principal agents in breaking down isolation among towns and creating a systemic character. In an historical context where recognized methods involving flow data are not possible, alternative analyses are necessary. These comprise density usage mail route maps, which rely mainly on a visual impression of systemic extension and interurban interaction, and regression models of actual on potential interaction of towns in the telegraphic and railway networks. The measure of a town's integration in the system is the level of its actual interaction in terms of volume of telephone and railway transactions, as compared with its potential for interaction arrived at by the use of the potential model.

AB  - Urban systems theory offers a useful and potentially powerful way of analysing public policy and service expenditures, a research field which, in the past, has lacked in general theory and good empirical results. It is hypothesized that just as cities which play an important role in the national urban system provide a wide range of specialized and expensive goods and services in the private sector, so also will they tend to spend heavily on a range of public services and amenities. Following recent theoretical developments, the presence of the headquarters of major companies is used as a measure of the importance of English and Welsh cities in the national urban system, and this measure is related to service expenditures. The results strongly support the hypothesis, and suggest that levels of service expenditure, particularly on what are termed indivisible services, are related to the general characteristics of an urban system, rather than directly to the concentration of business headquarters.

The ESM method proposed, based on Shannon's entropy analysis, is useful to evaluate different alternative measures of new energy saving technology transfer at different programming stages for consumption reduction and environmental impact control. A case study has been conducted in an urban area of Florence (Italy): the action/factor interaction entropy values can provide a scale of intervention priority and by comparing results obtained evaluating conditional entropy, ambiguity and redundancy, it is possible to identify the highest energy sustainable intervention in terms of higher or lower critical and risky action/factor combinations for the project being carried out. The ESM method proposed, if applied to different urban areas, can provide a rational criterion to compare complex innovative and sustainable technologies for irreversibility reduction and energy efficiency increase. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Updated to reflect the latest changes and advances in the field, Distribution System Modeling and Analysis, Third Edition again illustrates methods that will ensure the most accurate possible results in computational modeling for electric power distribution systems. With the same simplified approach of previous editions, this book clearly explains the principles and mathematics behind system models, also discussing the "smart grid" concept and its special benefits. However, this volume adds a crucial element not found in previous editions. The first two books developed models for all components but focused less on how to actually implement those models on a computer for planning and for real-time analysis. This book includes numerous models of components and several practical examples, to demonstrate how engineers can apply and customize computer programs to help them plan and operate systems. It also covers approximation methods to help users interpret computer program feedback, so they recognize when a result is not what it should be. Another improvement is the book's earlier introduction (in chapter 4) of the modified ladder iterative technique. The author explains the need for this method—which is used in most distribution analysis programs—detailing how it is applied and why it is among the most powerful options. Concluding with a detailed summary of presented topics that readers have come to expect, this edition provides useful problems, references, and assignments that help users apply Mathcad® and WIndmil programs to put their new learning into practice. An invaluable tool for engineering students and professionals worldwide, this book explores cutting-edge advances in modeling, simulation, and analysis of distribution systems that can ensure the continued dispersal of safe, reliable energy.Watch William H.

AB  - The diminishing importance of national frontiers in western Europe has intensified competition between cities for mobile investment, for the location of public institutions and for hallmark events. This has led to the creation of league tables of cities in which rankings are determined by single or multiple variables. Analyses of changes in rankings focus on whether there has been divergence or convergence amongst European cities. This paper uses data on 117 cities to suggest that there was convergence in 1981-84, followed by divergence in 1984-87. The paper goes on to test three hypotheses which relate urban economic growth to size or capital status, to location within the core or periphery, and location within northern or southern Europe. Overall it finds that capital cities grow more quickly, in economic terms; that the urban south is catching up with the urban north; and that, whilst the cities of the core did best before 1985, there is some evidence that 'crowding out' has relatively helped the cities of the periphery since 1985.

AB  - In this paper I analyze the impact of basic training and specialized training on the distribution of skill, income disparity, social welfare, and on the structure of a decentralized specialized city system. This is done in a spatial general-equilibrium model of a closed economy producing a single consumption good. The economy is populated with a continuum of unskilled labor with potential heterogeneous ability. The only consumption good can be produced by specialized technology or by general technology. Specialized technology requires specialized training that enables each worker to transform his potential ability into productivity. General technology requires basic training that enables all workers, independent of their potential ability, to produce the good at a constant marginal product. In this framework I show that such an equilibrium exists uniquely and is efficient. Then I characterize the conditions that lead to a different distribution of skills, a different system of cities, and generate income disparity endogenously. Thus, the paper presents a link among income disparities, social welfare, and the structure of an urban system that is new to this literature.

This type of model is studied under the simplifying assumption that the location of places among counties is random, but the distinction between county-seat places and other places leads to the restriction that no county contains more than one county-seat place. This model is tested for urban places in the state of Iowa in terms of distribution (frequency distribution of places within counties) and arrangement (relative concentration or dispersion of places among adjacent counties). An intensive empirical examination of the model is conducted, and generally good agreement is found between values given by the model and values obtained from the Iowa urban system.

AB  - In recent years, a three-stage mono-polar concentration of higher functions into Tokyo, regional capitals and prefectural capitals has been under way in Japan. This trend is considered to have arisen as a result of the changing spatial organization of major enterprises, exemplified by their head/branch office locations. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the national urban system of Japan by focusing on the horizontal and vertical growth of the spatial organization of major enterprises and their temporal changes during the past two decades. A total of 2,499 listed enterprises is examined here, and the data used were obtained from the Directory of Executives of Major Enterprises (kaisha shokuin roku) and Handbook of Organizations and Establishments (soshikizu jigyosho binran) published by the Diamond Inc. The findings can be summarized as follows: First, an analysis of the spatial organization of four enterprise categories based on the number of cities with branch offices reveals that the more branch offices a category has and the larger it is, the greater the concentration of head offices in Tokyo. In this situation, regional capital cities as administrative centers tend to preside over local cities. This suggests that growth of enterprise is generally accompanied by a process of concentration of head office functions into Tokyo, horizontal growth of the branch office network and vertical/hierarchical growth of administrative functions. Second, the Japanese urban system exhibits a hierarchical structure consisting of three stages: Tokyo as a strategic center, regional capital cities as administrative centers and prefectural capital cities as local business centers. However, a distinction is also observed in the case of regional capital cities; specifically, the system shows signs of differentiation between the higher rank cities of Sendai and Fukuoka and the lower rank cities of Sapporo and Hiroshima. Additionally, the growth of Omiya as a significant center in the northern portion of the Kanto region and the stagnation of Nagoya and Takamatsu are noteworthy. This movement has contributed to the collapse of a clear-cut hierarchical structure and the reorganization of the previously established urban system in the country. Third, an analysis of temporal changes in the spatial organization of the major enterprises under consideration reveals that, in the 1980s, the prefectural capital cities were chosen as the new locations of branch offices and the regional capital cities experienced an expansion of administrative functions in the form of rank elevation to unify the prefectural capitals. In the recessionary years of the 1990s, however, the closure/withdrawal of branch offices and the absorption of smaller ones into large ones generally increased, suggesting a restructuring of the spatial organization of the enterprises.

AB  - The demand for urban green space is increasing while availability is decreasing. The value of urban green space is that it conserves critical characteristics of the natural landscape within the urban setting. The characteristics are essential for the function of ecological processes necessary for the sustainability of an ecosystem. These goods and services we extract from ecosystems are called ecological services. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the technologies and methods by which ecological services could be restored in a disturbed urban stream system. Specific objectives included bio-retention of storm water and parking lot runoff, re-establishment of fish pool habitat, implementation of natural bank stabilization, integration of riparian zone buffers, and regulation of stream geometry for maximum in-stream ecological services. We designed off-channel subsurface bio-retention cells to reduce pollution loading to the stream from a nearby parking lot and to maximize retention volume of water in the cells to recharge stream base flow. We integrated the bio-retention cell infiltration zones with the geomorphologic design of the stream channel to provide conditions desirable for fish and other aquatic communities as well as to discourage algae blooms and mosquito infestation. We designed riparian zones with native flora to provide needed habitat for terrestrial animal communities. Finally, we used natural bank stabilization features such as root wads, native tree logs, and boulders to reduce bank erosion and channel entrenchment and to enhance refugia for aquatic organisms.

AB  - This paper discusses platform independent Web application modeling and development in the context of model-driven engineering. A specific metamodel (and associated notation) is introduced and motivated for the modeling of dynamic Web specific concerns. Web applications are represented via three independent but related models (business, hypertext and presentation). A kind of action language (based on OCL and Java) is used all over these models to write methods and actions, specify constraints and express conditions. The concepts described in the paper have been implemented in the Netsilon tool and operational model-driven Web information systems have been successfully deployed by translation from abstract models to platform specific models.

This chapter is devoted to the basic construction principles and challenges of such models, whereas application examples are provided in companion chapters. Since they still do not incorporate the full complexity of the real climate system (and maybe never will), Earth system models nowadays typically focus on specific aspects, for instance on the role of chemically active substances in the climate system.

AB  - Mounting interest in the global system of cities has led many scholars\nto portray large, world-class cities as control points in the global\neconomy. From this position, they govern global banking, finance\nand international corporate relations with the assistance of advanced\n\nbusiness services and telecommunications. While large cities have\ntaken on many global functions, recent research has cast them only\nas outposts in the global economy and pays little attention to their\nrole in regional and national economies. This paper explores the\nrole of five large US cities in regional and national economies.\nUsing primary trade data for five high-order business services, we\nidentify the extent to which these large cities trade with other\nlarge cities of the US urban system, smaller-sized cities, and test\nstatistically the effect that firm attributes and physical characteristics\nof the city system have on shaping the areal extent of large city\ninteraction (trade). The results indicate that: trade is consistently\nbiased towards other large cities; the size of origin cities is associated\nwith the size of destination cities; and, distance more so than destination\ncity size plays the dominant role in shaping large city patterns\nof trade.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to examine the population growth pattern of the Japanese urban settlements and the factors behind the changes between 1970 and 1990. To investigate the changing Japanese urban settlements on the basis of functional urban regions, a new definition of functional urban regions called 'Japanese Functional Urban Area' (JFUA) was established. Analyses based on the new JFUA definition, such as population change and urban development stages, show that the Japanese settlement system witnessed the concentration of population into larger settlements in the 1970s and the 1980s. The largest settlements such as Tokyo and Osaka recorded growth in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition, the Tokyo area showed a 'unipolar concentration' pattern of population growth. We can classify these areas with high levels of population growth into two types. The first one is JFUAs that contain a prefectural capital city, political centre of its region, and the second one is small or medium-sized settlements that are located near the largest settlements such as Tokyo or Nagoya. Declining areas share similar characteristics; they are remote from the largest settlements and relatively small in size. In addition, some old style manufacturing centres recorded population loss in the 1980s. Although the Japanese settlement system presents a different growth pattern from the US and UK, the factors contributing to urban change in Japan turned out to be similar. The role of the service sector was highly important to growth, whilst the declining industries such as steel and shipbuilding were no longer important in promoting regional development and influenced urban decline. This study also examines the changing population pattern of selected areas that are treated as the government's policy target areas, and shows that it is difficult to find any evidence of policy effectiveness. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - With the current debate on urban policy as background. this paper reviews recent trends in the Canadian urban system, and documents the implications of these trends for planning and public policy. Although urban planners tend not to work at this scale. the ongoing reorganization of the urban system provides the broader context for their policies and plans. The analysis focuses on the effects on cities of the demographic transition and an aging population, intense economic restructuring and shifting patterns of international trade, increased immigration and ethno-cultural diversity, and the changing role of the state. These factors, in combination, have tended to augment levels of metropolitan concentration and increase the degree of uneven growth. They have also sharpened the economic and social divide between growing and declining places, and placed additional stress on service providers and on the resources of local governments. In concluding, the paper asks whether we are creating, as an outcome of these trends, new sources of difference - new fault lines - in Canadian society and in the country's urban fabric.

AB  - In this paper it is argued that the traditional modeling paradigm of physics cannot be employed for most processes in the social and behavioral sciences. The critical ingredient making the classical physics-based modeling procedures work is the presence of a law, which organizes the data. The basic idea presented here is that, in the absence of a law, the model must be constructed solely from the (ata by mathematical means. The procedures for carrying out this prescription are introduced in non-technical terms, and a discussion is given of their implications for the social sciences.

AB  - In geographic information systems (GIS) studies there has been some difficulty integrating socioeconomic and physiogeographic data. One important type of socioeconomic data, census data, offers a wide range of socioeconomic information, but is aggregated within arbitrary enumeration districts ( EDs ). Values reflect either raw counts or, when standardized, the mean densities in the EDs. On the other hand, remote sensing imagery, an important type of physiogeographic data, provides large quantities of information with more spatial details than census data. Based on the dasymetric mapping principle, this study applies multivariable regression to examine the correlation between population counts from cen~ and land cover types. The land cover map is classifwd from LandSat TM imagery. The correlation is high. Census population counts are remodeled to a GIS raster layer based on the discovered correlations coupled with scaling techniques, which offset influences from other than land cover types. The GIS raster layer depicts the population distribution with much more spatial detail than census data offer. The resulting GIS raster layer is ready to be analyzed or integrated with other GIS data. ©

AB  - The specialized literature has proposed various approaches to the delimitation of urban and metropolitan systems. Administrative aspects (administrative units historically inherited), morphological (urban continuum), some linked to the economies of agglomeration (population and employment density, urban economic activities,...) or functional interaction (home-work commuting) have been used for the definition of a metropolitan area. At the same time it has developed in recent years, an extensive literature that has come to reveal the progressive trend of the metropolitan areas to the polycentrism. There is no doubt that the monocentric city paradigm, structured around a single CBD, is broken. The contemporary metropolises have seen the emergence of the phenomenon of the sub centers. However, few efforts have been directed to address the two aspects together: a) the urban-metropolitan delimitation and b) the analysis of its internal structure. This paper addresses the challenge of defining both the metropolitan systems and their internal composition, structured or not around different sub centers. The methodology developed of the Interaction Value simultaneously allows delimiting these two levels of urban structure: the metropolitan system as a whole and the subsystems articulated around the emerging or consolidated sub centers, by measuring the functional relationships between housing and workplaces. At the same time, the Interaction Value assesses the degree of polycentrism beyond the simple identification of sub centers developed in the literature. In this sense, and using the mobility matrix supplied by the Census of 2001, this paper delimitates the urban and metropolitan systems in Spain, and presents new results concerning the internal structure of such systems. © Copyright Josep Roca Cladera, Montserrat Moix Bergadà y Blanca Arellano Ramos, 2012.

"This article presents new figures, as recently published in China, discusses their significance and draws some conclusions about the quality of modern urbanization in China.  There are mainly three basic factors responsible for the present situation:  1. The tremendous increase in the rural population; 2. The influence of historical times from which two different city systems evolved (the traditional one and the colonial); 3. The planning strategies since 1949."  The author notes that although the overall level of urbanization is low, there are considerable differences in regional urbanization levels.  It is suggested that there have been profound changes in the Chinese urban system and urban spatial distribution patterns, which are not yet reflected in the available statistics. (SUMMARY IN ENG)

The frameworks apply to the Ecuadorian amazon. Universal conceptualizations are broadly relevant; context-dependant conceptualizations are partially so. This pattern raises the question of whether a government based service sector is a mechanism for urban dominance, as were wholesaling and finance in North America. Selected case studies indicate that the urban system in the Ecuadorian Amazon is representative of present-day frontier regions.

The system exhibits three different states, i.e. moving state, saturation state and global deadlock state. With a grid coarsening method, vehicle distribution in the moving state and the saturation state has been studied. Interesting structures (e.g. windmill-like ones, T-shirt-like ones, Y-like ones) have been revealed. A metastability of the system is observed in the transition from the saturation state to the global deadlock state. The effect of an advanced traveller information system (ATIS), the traffic light period and the traffic light switch strategy have also been investigated.

AB  - A Mixed-integer linear optimization model is developed to support the decision making for the sustainable use of energy in the local area. It details exploitation of primary energy sources, electrical and thermal generation, end-use sectors and emissions. The model covers both the energy demand and energy supply sides, and can provide valuable information both on the technical options, and on the possible policy measures. By aiming to realize a low-carbon energy system, the proposed optimization process provides feasible generation settlements between utility grid and distributed generations, as well as optimal diffusion of energy efficiency technologies. Moreover, the mathematical methods for solving the developed model are discussed. The focus is paid on the general solution method for mixed-integer linear optimization model including simplex algorithm and branch-and-bound algorithm. By using the suggested solution methods, the local energy system optimization problem is expected to be resolved in a reasonable time with enough precision.

AB  - The central theme of this paper is to describe how cloud system resolving models (CRMs) of grid spacing approximately 1 km have been applied to various important problems in atmospheric science across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and how these applications relate to other modeling approaches. A long-standing problem concerns the representation of organized precipitating convective cloud systems in weather and climate models. Since CRMs resolve the mesoscale to large scales of motion (i.e., 10 km to global) they explicitly address the cloud system problem. By explicitly representing organized convection, CRMs bypass restrictive assumptions associated with convective parameterization such as the scale gap between cumulus and large-scale motion. Dynamical models provide insight into the physical mechanisms involved with scale interaction and convective organization. Multiscale CRMs simulate convective cloud systems in computational domains up to global and have been applied in place of contemporary convective parameterizations in global models. Multiscale CRMs pose a new challenge for model validation, which is met in an integrated approach involving CRMs, operational prediction systems, observational measurements, and dynamical models in a new international project: the Year of Tropical Convection, which has an emphasis on organized tropical convection and its global effects.

AB  - Northern Alaska is a prolific oil and gas province estimated to contain a significant proportion of the undiscovered oil and gas of the circum-Arctic. A three-dimensional petroleum system model was constructed with the aim of significantly improving the understanding of the generation, migration, accumulation, and loss of hydrocarbons in the region. This study provides a unique geologic perspective that will reduce exploration risk and assess the remaining potential hydrocarbon resources in this remote province. The present-day geometry is based on newly interpreted seismic data and a database of more than 400 wells. A key aspect of this model is an improved reconstruction of the progradation of the time-transgressive Cretaceous–Tertiary Brookian sequence and multiple erosion events in the Tertiary. The deposition of these overburden rocks controlled the timing of hydrocarbon generation in underlying source rocks and their principal migration from the Colville Basin northward to the Barrow Arch. The model provides a reconstruction of the complex and dynamic interplay of diachronous deposition and erosion and allows assessment of variations in migration behavior and prediction of the present-day petroleum distribution.

National urban systems are restructuring and adapting themselves to this new international and economic context. The location of the largest multinational firms is taken as revealing a major step in the process of the integration of European cities into supra-national networks. A survey of the location of 3000 establishments belonging to the 300 largest European firms provides interesting results about the factors making European cities attractive for such activities. It may be inferred from these results that they confirm a new trend called `metropolisation', which is reinforcing the top of the national urban hierarchies, as demonstrated in other studies.\n

AB  - The application of intelligent systems within the field of remote sensing is reviewed with special reference to urban land cover mapping from digital satellite imagery. Urban areas constitute spectrally heterogenous land- cover classes and call for the application of intelligent, texture-based image processing methods. The appearance of an urban land-cover class in a digital image generated by remote sensing is closely related to the spatial resolution of the image, i.e. significant changes occur as a result of increased/decreased spatial resolution. This paper discuss how texture information may be derived automatically from a generic spatial model of a possibly composite urban land cover class describing basic properties of the subordinate object classes and the spatial relations between these. A method based on prediction of cooccurrence matrix values corresponding to an urban land-cover class at a specific spatial resolution is described.

AB  - A recent study on the European integration of the Italian urban system shows that globalisation processes do not necessarily separate cities from their regional networks. The most successful cases of recent urban development in Italy are associated with the formation of metropolitan networked regions in which a major metropolitan centre is linked with cities of a lower level by hierarchical, complementary and synergetic relations. The paper examines the result of an analysis carried out on 148 major Italian daily urban systems. It takes into account two sets of indicators: one referring to the supraregional network interactions, measuring the degree of globalisation, and one referring to the proximity interactions inside the regional networks, measuring the degree of regional cohesion. They allow the definition of typologies of urban systems founded on a (normally positive) correlation between supraregional functional openness and regional integration.

AB  - A dictionary definition states that a model is “a miniature representation of something; a pattern of something to be made; an example for imitation or emulation; a description or analogy used to help visualize something (e.g., an atom) that cannot be directly observed; a system of postulates, data, and inferences presented as a mathematical description of an entity or state of affairs.” This definition suggests that modeling is an activity, a cognitive activity in which one thinks about and makes models to describe how devices or objects of interest behave. Since there are many ways in which devices and behaviors can be described—words, drawings or sketches, physical models, computer programs, or mathematical formulas—it is worth refining the dictionary definition for the present purposes to define a mathematical modelasa representation in mathematical terms of the behavior of real devices and objects. Scientists use mathematical models to describe observed behavior or results; explain why that behavior and results occurred as they did; and to predict future behaviors or results that are as yet unseen or unmeasured. Engineers use mathematical models to describe and analyze objects and devices to predict their behavior because they are interested in designing devices and processes and systems. Design is a consequential activity for engineers because every new airplane or building, for example, represents a model-based prediction that the plane will fly and the building will stand without dire, unanticipated consequences. Thus, especially in engineering, it is important to ask: How are such mathematical models or representations created?Howare they validated?Howare they used?And, is their use limited, and how? To answer these and related questions, this chapter first sets out some basic principles of mathematical modeling and then goes on to briefly describe: • dimensional consistency and dimensional analysis; • abstraction and scaling; • conservation and balance laws; and • the role of linearity. 5-1

The interest in this topic relies on the fact that the glucose measurements are much more economical and faster then the insulin measurements. An algorithm providing reliable insulin concentrations in real-time is essential for the realization of an “artificial pancreas”, an automatic device aimed to infuse the required amount of insulin into the circulatory system of a diabetic patient. An important issue for a good observer design is the determination of satisfactory models of the glucose-insulin homeostasis. Different models have been considered and discussed in this paper. For all models presented an asymptotic state observer has been constructed and numerical simulations have been successfully carried out.

AB  - A hierarchical urban system is examined with respect to certain economic linkages or flows which exist among the different levels of the hierarchy. The underlying locational basis of the urban system is represented in terms of a standard central place model in which flows of central place goods are specified. In order to incorporate important facets of contemporary urban systems, this framework is extended to consider first the existence of specialized (non-central place) goods, and second the presence of commuting, the flows associated with each phenomenon being separately discussed. Attention is then directed to the coexistence of different types of flows, not only in terms of the interrelations among them but also in terms of the balance-of-payments implications for the various levels of the hierarchy.

We consider spatial features of the location of cities and city outcomes in terms of population and wages. Our results suggest a number of interesting puzzles. In particular, we find that city location is essentially a random process and that interactions between cities do not help determine the size of a city. Both of these findings contradict our theoretical priors about the role of geography (physical and economic) in determining city outcomes. More detailed study suggests some solutions that allow us to restore a role for geography but a number of puzzles remain.

AB  - Research and policy debates in the United States have focused on the dramatic growth of mortgage lending in the fisky subprime sector, which serves consumers with weaker credit histories, and its concentration in racially and ethnically marginalized communities. Exidence linking the subprime boom to the proliferation of predatory abuses, however is often dismissed as anecdotal or isolated in a few unique places. In this paper, we undertake a geographical analysis ot the central justification for deregulated risk-based pricing; the proposition that subprime credit serves those who would otherwise be excluded, and reduces exclusionary credit denials. Multivariate analysis of metropolitan and individual-level proceses across the US urban system provide evidence suggesting that subprime mortgage segmentation exacerbates rather than reduces traditional inequities of denial based exclusion.

AB  - The Chinese economy has transformed from the development of industries in the early economic reform period of the 1980s to the development of service industries in the 2000s and, more recently, the emergence of producer service industries. Producer services have become increasingly important to the Chinese economy. Most studies on producer services in China mainly focus on individual cities. Spatial development of producer services at the regional and national levels is relatively less examined. In this paper we analyze the growth and location of producer services in the Chinese urban system. The study also shows that producer services are becoming spatially more concentrated across the urban system. As producer services that are important in generating economic development are more likely to be located in large metropolitan areas, they tend to reinforce the competitiveness of large cities. Moreover, the uneven spatial development of producer services suggests that small and medium cities need to conduct careful market studies and analyses on their ability to attract producer service industries before they initiate large central business district development projects and invest in massive construction of of ces.

AB  - The relations between agents, modeling, and simulation are manifold (Uhrmacher et al., 2001). In relating agents and simulation research,we will concentrate on using agents as ametaphor tomodel the system of interest andonusing virtualdynamic environments toanalyze the behavior ofmultiagent software systems. Thereby, modeling aspects rather than the many challenges of an efficient execution shall be the focus. Before starting our exploration, we will shortly introduce agents and discuss some characteristics that also influence the relation between agents and simulation.

AB  - In this paper we analyze how distances between a sample of a hundred major world cities varies when measured in cyberspace. The project develops a novel spatial stat- istical model based upon the number of user-generated placemarks indexed by Google Maps.We demonstrate how this metric captures the “invisible” patterns of intercity infor- mation flows and helps comprehend the contours of the complex digital network that exists between large urban centers across the world. Using a specially designed software program to interrogate Google Maps, a series of keyword searches (“tourism,” “business,” “hotel”) as well as each of the city names were conducted in each of the sample places. Comparing this digital measure with the material movement of people and other relevant descriptive variables, such as national economic development and language differences, we were able to provide a cogent model that plausibly explains why certain city pairs (especially those that are physically distant) exhibit strong informational linkages. While the strength of these digital connections undoubtedly demonstrates the continued importance of physical proxi- mity and established transport infrastructures in the twenty-first century, one can also observe significant evidence for [new?] digital “wormholes” which indicates that processes of globalization driven by online interaction also operates by its own rules.

AB  - In Denmark, the first actual towns can be dated to the eighth and ninth centuries. The establishment of towns became more significant in the eleventh and twelfth centuries in connection with the state-building process, and these towns were distinctly consumer towns serving as administrative, religious and military centres. From 1200 to 1350 Denmark, similar to the German area, underwent considerable urbanization; a large number of market towns were created, and in contrast to the older ones they were mercantile towns. Denmark thus clearly became the most urbanized country in Scandinavia. As Copenhagen grew in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the urban system decisively changed its character in the direction of a primate system. The characteristics of the primate system are particularly distinct within the boundaries of the Kingdom of Denmark, but less pronounced if the entire monarchy is included in the period in which Denmark was a conglomerate state. The institutional conditions must in general be attributed considerable importance in explaining Danish urban development. Thus, Denmark is one of the countries where town privileges were of great significance until the middle of the nineteenth century.

AB  - Chemical species such as radiocarbon, chlorofluorocarbons, and tritium-3He, often termed chemical tracers, are important tools for ocean carbon cycle research because they can be used to trace circulation pathways, estimate timescales, and determine absolute rates. Large-scale ocean gradients of nutrients, oxygen, and dissolved inorganic carbon reflect a combination of circulation, mixing, and the production, transport, and respiration of organic matter. Chemical tracers provide additional, often independent, information useful in separating these biogeochemical and physical processes. Biogeochemical and tracer observations are often framed in terms of ocean circulation models, ranging from simple, idealized models to full three-dimensional simulations. Model advection and diffusion rates are typically calibrated or evaluated against transient tracer data. Idealized models are straightforward to construct and computationally inexpensive and are thus conducive to hypothesis testing and extensive exploration of parameter space. More complete and sophisticated dynamics can be incorporated into three-dimensional models, which are also more amenable for direct comparisons with field data. Models of both classes are used commonly to examine specific biogeochemical process, quantify the uptake of anthropogenic carbon, and study the carbon cycle responses to climate change. All models have potential drawbacks, however, and part of the art of numerical modeling is deciding on the appropriate model(s) for the particular question at hand. ?? 2009 Copyright ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - "In this paper we trace and interpret changes in the geographical pattern and city-size distribution of the world's largest cities in the twentieth century.  Since 1900 the geographical distribution of these cities has become increasingly dispersed; their city-size distribution by rank was nearly linear in 1900 and 1940, and convex in 1980. We interpret the convex distribution which emerged following World War 2 as reflecting an economically integrated but politically and demographically partitioned global urban system.  Our interpretation of changes in size distribution of cities emphasizes demographic considerations, largely neglected in previous investigations, including migration and relative rates of population change."

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to model the national and regional city-size distribution of the Saudi Arabian urban system using 1987 population estimates, and to examine the factors that have influenced the development of the urban system. The pareto coefficients of the national and regional distributions were found to be low, signifying the prevalence of smaller sized cities in the distribution. The national system was found to have a multi-city primacy situation, while the regional distributions displayed varied primacy characteristics. Factors noted to influence the development of the urban system include geographical and economic factors, as well as public policies. The paper identified three areas of population agglomeration and it is concluded that future growth might lead to a regional convergence depending on policy initiatives and on whether the urban system follows the typical pattern of other urban systems. © 1996 Journals Oxford Ltd.

AB  - A gradient descent plus fuzzy control (GD+FC) learning strategy is
proposed. In this method, the learning procedure is considered as a
feedback control system that consists of a controlled process, a
feedback mechanism, and a feedback controller. Therefore, the fuzzy
control technique may be implemented in order to achieve fast and stable
convergence in the learning procedure. After that the convergence
feature of the proposed learning algorithm is investigated. Then, the
proposed algorithm is used to train neural networks for system modeling.
A comparison of the proposed algorithm with the other learning
approaches, e.g. GD and PIDGD methods, is also illustrated. Finally, the
article presents an example of system modeling for a temperature process
with the proposed learning approach

AB  - The city-size structure and spatial distribution of the urban system reflect socioeconomic development and its spatial distribution. By tracking the development of the urban system, we can not only monitor the development of the society, but also reveal problems in the process of development and thereby provide a basis for policymaking. Yeh and Xu (1985) analyzed the development of China's urban system between 1949 and 1978. Since 1978 a series of new policies has been introduced, including rural reform, urban reform, establishment of the socialist market system, the opening to the outside world, and emphasis on the development of the coastal region of China. All have contributed to China's emergence as the most rapidly growing economy in the world and have dramatically changed its economic structure and pattern of regional development. Correspondingly, significant changes also have taken place within China's urban system. This paper focuses on new trends in China's urban system between 1978 and 1990 and their relationships with economic development during this period.

AB  - We estimated vertical and lateral fluxes of carbon for the isolated coastal city of Ensenada (Baja California, Mexico). In 2005, the city had a resident population of about 261,000, with tourism adding about 1.5%; it occupied an area of roughly 68 square kilometers (km(2)). Carbon (C) export was estimated at 400 gigagrams of carbon per year (Gg C/yr); notable sources to the atmosphere were combustion engines (42%), cement production (38%), water heating and cooking (7%), and human respiration (6%). Solid waste (6%) was exported for burial, but efflux to the bay was minor (about 0.1 Gg C/yr). Local deposition was limited to sewage sludge (about 2 Gg C/yr), asphalt, and extremely low primary production. Remote fluxes driven by local demand could be estimated only for electricity (61 Gg C/yr), but local flux from cement and other industrial production might be attributed largely to external demand. The urban system output to the atmosphere was about 6.4 kilograms of carbon per square meter per year (kg C/m(2)/yr), or roughly 23.6 kg/m(2)/yr in CO(2) equivalence. By comparison, net ecosystem productivity in the surrounding watershed has been estimated at 0.04 kg C/m(2)/yr, so the city's atmospheric output of C might be balanced by productivity over about 11,000 km(2) of the surrounding ecosystems. Between 2000 and 2005, C output increased faster than population growth, particularly from engine fuels.

AB  - The generalized information entropy (GIE) has been introduced to describe complex interactions among agents in complex urban system (CUS). Basing on maximum generalized information entropy principle (MGIEP), a dynamic model and detailed simulations that can reveal agents' interactions and evolutionary mechanism of complex urban patterns are then proposed. Urban evolutionary pattern analyses of Shanghai City in China are conducted as a typical application. It is confident that the present framework can provide a brand new approach to investigate general CUS.

AB  - The Colombian urban system went from a polycentric structure, in the nineteenth century, to a network organized around four cities, energized by industrial development in the first half of the twentieth century. From the fifties, the acceleration of industrialization under a Keynesian model and the restructuring of regional economies by diversifying exports and mining, led to a growing primacy of Bogotá. The enthronement of the country in the process of globalization in the nineties and the subsequent industrial and agricultural crises remodeled regional economies, causing stagnation in some regions such as the Coffee and the upper valley of the Magdalena and revitalization of cities such as Bucaramanga and Cartagena. This paper examines the latter period, with the aim of providing an overview of the current structure of the network of cities, now modeled by processes of economic globalization and political liberalization.

AB  - New applications of Levin’s Universal Optimal Search are presented in this paper2. Using this method one finds solutions to a few chosen problems. Such solu- tions are characterized by possibility of the maximal generalization. In the deterministic version of the Uni- versal Optimal Search algorithm one can always gen- erate the best solution. It is shown that it is possible to find a solution by this methodfor problems in neural networks for which back-propagation type of methods face difficulties. Another application considered here is a problem of finding an exit-way from a maze. There exists a probabilistic version of Levin’s uni- versal search [4]. This work offers an alternative im- plementation of the Levin’s Universal OptimalSearch.

AB  - This research investigates the evolution of the system of Canadian\ndecision-making centers using the location of corporate board members\nas a surrogate for the location of economic control. The major premise\nexamined by this study states that, through much of the study period,\nboard linkages should tend to concentrate on Toronto, Canada's dominant\ncorporate administration center. While Toronto gains importance,\nMontreal loses connections, devolving from close competition with\nToronto for national influence to become a major regional center for\nQuebec. At the same time, cities in other parts of the country gain\nimportance as they evolve into major centers for their region. The\nresult of these changes is the emergence of a dominant national center,\nalong with a second tier of cities of regional importance.\nThe results of the board member analysis reveal that the economy as a\nwhole increasingly concentrates control in Toronto through the 1970s\nand 1980s. Montreal loses director connections with the rest of the\ncountry through the same period. While the economy as a whole\ncentralizes in Toronto, certain sectors of the economy decentralize\ntheir directors to regional centers. Calgary, in particular, emerges as\na major regional center for western Canada. The paper relates these\nobservations to the dual conceptual frameworks of quaternary location\ntheory and the resource dependence perspective.

AB  - The paper examines the geography of corporate headquarters in the Australian urban system, giving consideration to their location, control of capital and performance. The paper argues that, while considerable recent attention has been given to global cities in the networks of corporate power, the spatial organisation of company headquarters remains important within national urban systems. In the case of Australia, Sydney and Melbourne dominate the corporate landscape, although the smaller cities of Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth occupy important niches. The paper demonstrates that there are clear variations in the relative performance of companies across the Australian urban system. There is also a pattern of sectoral specialisation within Australia's cities which, in part, helps to explain the different development trajectories and relative levels of corporate performance. The paper concludes by exploring some of the implications of the study for the understanding of urban systems.

AB  - This study analyses differences between counter-urban movers and movers heading for other destinations. Through the elaboration of a spatial model based upon settlement structure and functional hinterlands, counter-urban migration can be measured on the ground throughout the urban system. Empirical analysis of the counter-urban mover is rendered possible by access to a comprehensive longitudinal micro-database that contains demographic, socio-economic and detailed geographic information for all Swedish citizens. Binomial and multinomial logit models are estimated to capture the partial effects of variables related to the individual, the household, the labour market, life course events, and regional economic conditions on the choice of migration destination. The results of the analyses show that counter-urban movers are more likely to be older, born in Sweden or any other Scandinavian country, less well-off, having a university qualification, living single, being outside the labour force, and becoming unemployed close to the migration event. The emerging picture of the Swedish counter-urban mover reveals an individual who may be striving for other qualities in life, where career and earnings are of minor importance. Somewhat unexpectedly, the counter-urban movers show no systematic differences depending on their place of departure. No clear hierarchy-specific effects across the urban system can be found. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.

AB  - "There is evidence that Australia's urban system is changing. Since the mid-1970s there has been growth in the number and total population of regional cities. It is argued that this growth is a product of restructuring and the de-regulation of the Australian economy. Regional cities have become more prominent in the national economy as centres for manufacturing, as a consequence of the growth of tourism and recreation industries, through the decline in some areas of smaller urban settlements and as a result of new mining developments."
