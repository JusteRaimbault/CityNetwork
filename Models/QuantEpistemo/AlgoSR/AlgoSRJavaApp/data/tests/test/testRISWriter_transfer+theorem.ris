AB  - In this paper, we present a formal proof, developed in the Coq system, of the correctness of an automatic differentiation algorithm. This is an example of interaction between formal methods and numerical analysis (involving, in particular, real numbers). We study the automatic differentiation tool, called Oyssée, which deals with FORTRAN programs, and using Coq we formalize the correctness proof of the algorithm used by Oyssée for a subset of programs. To do so, we briefly describe the library of real numbers in Coq including real analysis, which was originally developed for this purpose, and we formalize a semantics for a subset of FORTRAN programs. We also discuss the relevance of such a proof.

AB  - Agȗr (דוגא) - sage or alderman; teacher or father, is presented in the first verse of Prov 30. The verse does not have a regular poetic metric and the meaning is not clear, so that in searching the sensus plenior the text succumbed to different emendations and an alternative metathesis of syllables. A safe or at least a conventional meaning of this verse has not been discovered yet. Verses 2-4 - a public confession by Agȗr and a series of rhetorical questions - have tired many exegetes of the Proverbs. Plöger, on the one hand, considers these verses as an expression of an ironic person, unable to reach a predictable goal of human research and now under the influence of many errors. On the other hand, Toy proposes that someone from the Pharisaic community is trying to answer a fundamental question about the Sadducees and is searching for the absolute meaning of Massora, Law, and Prophets. Oesterley observes here a typical sarcastic person who is tempted to ridicule those who pretend to have universal knowledge. McKane opines that these verses reveal a pious Hebrew who is cultivating monotheistic religion opposed to the polytheistic manipulation of human knowledge. Lelièvre - Maillot take this biblical text as an example of a manifest of human intellectual limit and Scott sees unrealizable ironic person. Skeptical apology begins with E. J. Dillon (1895.) and has dominated over Agȗr's wisdom for more than one century. Contemporary researchers discovered in it the orthodox expression which sometimes seems to take on a low dose of irony (Prov 30:4e) to obtain answers which had never been stated explicitly, but which are implicitly presupposed. Sarcasm, which Oesterley prefers, or irony, which Scott proclaims, is not clearly present in Agȗr's theorem if we study his teaching in light of rhetoric and stylistic classical figures and if we look to Prov 30:1-4 as one body of Hebrew biblical poetry. In Prov 30:2-4, Agȗr's public confession of piety is presented in two parallel and synchronic structural dimensions: Prov 30:2-3 and Prov 30:4. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper introduces several new variations of the equivalence theorem of Irvine [1964] which may increase the speed and accuracy of spectral radiative transfer models that calculate spectral radiance or flux. Using this theory, spectral gaseous, cloud, and surface absorptions are accommodated by integrating or summing over photon path length and scattering probability density functions (pdfs) after the completion of the multiple-scattering calculation. This procedure can be performed for absorption coefficients at any spectral resolution within a wavelength interval in which scattering properties of the atmosphere can be considered constant. This technique eliminates the need to run the multiple-scattering portion of a model more than once for each interval in lieu of integration and/or summation. If this procedure can be performed efficiently, dramatic increases in model speed may be realized. Also, because absorption coefficient spectral resolution can be extremely fine, the need for approximations or parameterizations is eliminated, increasing model accuracy. Unlike the original derivation, the new version of the gaseous absorption equation allows the use of complex model scattering atmospheres. An approximation is introduced which allows the use of gas profiles which vary in the vertical. Because employment of the complete theory requires a relatively large amount of computer memory, a pdf approximation is introduced to make it tractable. Validation of each relation is presented using a Monte Carlo model simulating shortwave flux. An example of shortwave flux transmitted through a three-dimensional model atmosphere obtained from the Monte Carlo/equivalence theorem (MC/ET) model is shown along with an analysis of the effect of constant scattering property wavelength interval size on the resulting broadband flux.

AB  - Combining theorem proving and model checking offers the tantalizing possibility of efficiently reasoning about large circuits at high levels of abstraction. We have constructed a system that seamlessly integrates symbolic trajectory evaluation based model checking with theorem proving in a higher-order classical logic. The approach is made possible by using the same programming language (fl) as both the meta and object language of theorem proving. This is done by ``lifting'' fl, essentially deeply embedding fl in itself. The approach is a pragmatic solution that provides an efficient and extensible verification environment. Our approach is generally applicable to any dialect of the ML programming language and any model-checking algorithm that has practical inference rules for combining results.

AB  - We formalise the data race free (DRF) guarantee provided by Java, as captured by the semi-formal Java Memory Model (JMM) [1] and published in the Java Language Specification [2]. The DRF guarantee says that all programs which are correctly synchronised (i.e., free of data races) can only have sequentially consistent behaviours. Such programs can be understood intuitively by programmers. Formalisation has achieved three aims. First, we made definitions and proofs precise, leading to a better understanding; our analysis found several hidden inconsistencies and missing details. Second, the formalisation lets us explore variations and investigate their impact in the proof with the aim of simplifying the model; we found that not all of the anticipated conditions in the JMM definition were actually necessary for the DRF guarantee. This allows us to suggest a quick fix to a recently discovered serious bug [3] without invalidating the DRF guarantee. Finally, the formal definition provides a basis to test concrete examples, and opens the way for future work on JMM-aware logics for concurrent programs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - During the 1980's, two landmark transfer projects were funded by the Ford Foundation. The Urban Community College Transfer Opportunities Program (UCC/TOP) aspired to increase the number of minority students transferring to and succeeding at four-year institutions. Many of the practical strategies developed during participating colleges, such as inter-session and summer programs with four-year colleges, honors programs, and enhanced communication between two-year/four-year faculty, remain pertinent. Later, the Ford Foundation funded the National Center for Academic Achievement and Transfer to expand upon the successful models created during the UCC/TOP project. Three institutions, Laney Community College in California, J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in Virginia, and the Houston Community College System in Texas, have been involved in both projects. The steady, collaborative efforts of these colleges underscore the following national trends: (1) awareness of partnerships is surging; (2) meetings between two- and four-year college faculty are increasingly common; (3) partnerships are expanding to include more institutions; and (4) academic partnerships are expanding vertically as well as horizontally, and partnerships are increasingly emphasizing math and science. If such partnerships are to realize their full potential secondary schools should be involved, reading and writing collaboration must not be ignored, and semester-length programs and interdisciplinary partnerships should be investigated.

AB  - Radiative heat transfer in three-dimensional nonhomogeneous participating medium was investigated by using REM 2 method. The anisotropic scattering phase function was dealt with the scaling technique based on delta function approximation. The three-dimensional scaled isotropic results were compared with the published anisotropic scattering computations. A good agreement between the scaled isotropic approaches and the anisotropic solutions was found. The effects of scattering albedo, forward fraction of phase function, and wall emissivity were discussed. It was found that, with the increase of the scattering albedo, the radiative heat flux increases for forward scattering media, but decreases for backward scattering media. The radiative heat flux is increased with the increases of forward fraction of phase function and wall emissivity. The emissive power at the center of a cubical nonhomogeneous medium in radiative equilibrium with gray diffuse walls equals to the averaged blackbody emissive power of the six walls.

AB  - Abstract In a given space of models or hypothesis the individual information content of each of them is considered as opposed to the Shannon´s entropy that measures the average information content of the mentioned space. Single model information contents allow expressing, in the Information Theory framework, Bayes´ Theorem and Shannon´s Information Functions (like the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Mutual Information), that are often expressed in the Probability framework. In particular expressing Bayes´ Theorem in terms of the information contents associated to its probabilities allows understanding how bits of information, introduced in the system by an observation, are transferred to each of the models in the space. It is shown how, from a single observation not one, but two causal information sources are generated: the Information Content Associated to the Evidence that always introduces positive information, and the Information Content Associated to the Bayes´ Likelihood that always introduces negative bits; therefore the evidence contributes to increase the probability of occurrence of the model and the likelihood to decrease it; depending on the net value of the difference between these two mentioned information contents, the information that arrives to a given model will be positive or negative. Thus, we propose a novel metric, given by the difference of the two mentioned information contents called transfer information content which measures the information transferred to each of the single models in the space. The resolution of the Monty Hall Problem (MHP) and some of its variants in the Information Theory framework proposed allows to confirm the validity of the formulas derived and to understand the counterintuitive and theoretically problematic concept of negative information. The implications of the concepts introduced in terms of information transfer to the emergent field of Local Information Dynamics, to Computational Neuroscience (particularly to Directed Information Theory and Neural Coding), and to Psychology, Active Learning, Decision Making or Philosophy between others, are proposed as further work

AB  - Markov chains are central to the understanding of random processes. This is not only because they pervade the applications of random processes, but also because one can calculate explicitly many quantities of interest. This textbook, aimed at advanced undergraduate or MSc students with some background in basic probability theory, focuses on Markov chains and quickly develops a coherent and rigorous theory whilst showing also how actually to apply it. Both discrete-time and continuous-time chains are studied. A distinguishing feature is an introduction to more advanced topics such as martingales and potentials in the established context of Markov chains. There are applications to simulation, economics, optimal control, genetics, queues and many other topics, and exercises and examples drawn both from theory and practice. It will therefore be an ideal text either for elementary courses on random processes or those that are more oriented towards applications.

The dependence of the ET matrix element V-rp upon d, the distance between the two parallel donor and acceptor, has been elucidated. Considering the motion of charge carrier in external electric field, we have studied the influence of the uniform electric field on the electron transfer matrix element and the location of the avoided crossing. We have found that the one-electron Koopmans theorem can be applied to the estimation of the electron transfer matrix element, and that the position of the avoided crossing can be determined by pursuing the minimum MO energy-splitting factor. Conformations of PPP oligomers, up to 10 phenyl rings, have been optimized with AM1 semiempirical method. The torsion angle between two vicinity phenyl rings, and the ionization potential have been calculated and discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an implementation of the finite volume method with the aim of studying subendocardial ischaemia during the ST segment. In this implementation, based on hexahedral finite volumes, each quadrilateral sub-face is split into two triangles to improve the accuracy of the numerical integration in complex geometries and when fibre rotation is included. The numerical method is validated against previously published solutions obtained from slab and cylindrical models of the left ventricle with subendocardial ischaemia and no fibre rotation. Epicardial potential distributions are then obtained for a half-ellipsoid model of the left ventricle. In this case it is shown that for isotropic cardiac tissue the degree of subendocardial ischaemia does not affect the epicardial potential distribution, which is consistent with previous findings from analytical studies in simpler geometries. The paper also considers the behaviour of various preconditioners for solving numerically the resulting system of algebraic equations resulting from the implementation of the finite volume method. It is observed that each geometry considered has its own optimal preconditioner.

AB  - We describe a formalization of the elementary algebra, topology and analysis of ﬁnite-dimensional Euclidean space in the HOL Light theorem prover. (Euclidean space is R^N with the usual notion of distance.) A notable feature is that the HOL type system is used to encode the dimension N in a simple and useful way, even though HOL does not permit dependent types. In the resulting theory the HOL type system, far from getting in the way, naturally imposes the correct dimensional constraints, e.g. checking compatibility in matrix multiplication. Among the interesting later developments of the theory are a partial decision procedure for the theory of vector spaces (based on a more general algorithm due to Solovay) and a formal proof of various classic theorems of topology and analysis for arbitrary N-dimensional Euclidean space, e.g. Brouwer's ﬁxpoint theorem and the diﬀerentiability of inverse functions.

AB  - Hierarchical Automata represent a structured model of statecharts. They are formalized in Isabelle/HOL. The formalization is on two levels. The first level is the set-based semantics; the second level exploits the tree-like structure of the hierarchical automata to represent them using Isabelleâ€™s datatypes and primitive recursive functions. Thereby the proofs about hierarchical automata are simplified. In order to ensure soundness of this twofold approach we define a mapping from the latter to the former representation and prove that it preserves the defining properties of hierarchical automata.

We verify the properties of the more abstract system, and then, once a refinement relation is exhibited between the systems, we show the more concrete system to have corresponding properties. We discuss the linear temporal logic framework we set up, commenting in particular on how we handle fairness and how we use a ‘leads-to-via’ predicate to reason about the propagation of properties that are stable in specified regions of system state spaces.

AB  - The transfer of new technologies (e.g., evidence-based practices) into substance abuse treatment organizations often occurs long after they have been developed and shown to be effective. Transfer is slowed, in part, due to a lack of clear understanding about all that is needed to achieve full implementation of these technologies. Such misunderstanding is exacerbated by inconsistent terminology and overlapping models of an innovation, including its development and validation, dissemination to the public, and implementation or use in the field. For this reason, a workgroup of the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network developed a field-driven conceptual model of the innovation process that more precisely defines relevant terms and concepts and integrates them into a comprehensive taxonomy. The proposed definitions and conceptual framework will allow for improved understanding and consensus regarding the distinct meaning and conceptual relationships between dimensions of the technology transfer process and accelerate the use of evidence-based practices.

AB  - Proof reuse addresses the issue of how proofs of theorems in a specific setting can be used to prove other theorems in different settings. This paper proposes an approach where theorems are generalised by abstracting their proofs from the original setting. The approach is based on a representation of proofs as logical framework proof terms, using the theorem prover Isabelle. The logical framework allows type-specific inference rules to be handled uniformly in the abstraction process and the provers automated proof tactics may be used freely. This way, established results become more generally applicable; for example, theorems about a data type can be reapplied to other types. The paper also considers how to reapply such abstracted theorems, and suggests an approach based on mappings between operations and types, and on systematically exploiting the dependencies between theorems.

We find that in addition to thermal broadening due to two-photon absorption, the emissivity of such cavities can exhibit asymmetric, non-Lorentzian lineshapes due to self-phase modulation. When the temperature of the cavity is larger than that of the external bath, we find that the heat transfer into the bath exceeds the radiation from a corresponding linear black body.We predict that these temperature-tunable thermal processes can be observed in realistic cavities at or near room temperature.

AB  - We reviewed the scale and intensity of disturbance, and the response of benthic and epibenthic communities, to intertidal aquaculture activities in Pacific Northwest estuaries. Available data indicate a spectrum of influences on the ability of estuaries to sustain biota unrelated to the cultured species. Certain disturbances, such as adding gravel to mudflats and sandflats to enhance clam production, may subtly impact certain benthic and epibenthic invertebrates without changing the carrying capacity for estuarine-dependent taxa, such as juvenile Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). However, habitat shifts might alter the relative suitability for different salmon species. In contrast, acute disturbances that produce large-scale changes in community dominants, such as manipulation of burrowing shrimp or eelgrass with pesticides or mechanical harvesting and manipulation of oyster grounds, strongly influence the carrying capacity for many fish and macroinvertebrates. Ensuring that estuarine ecosystems are sustainable for the breadth of processes and resources requires a comprehensive assessment of both natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes, landscape influences, and the effects of local management for particular species on other resources.

AB  - Published soil removal data suggest that the mass transfer process in a washing ma chine (transport of materials between cloth and bath) may influence or even dominate the soil removal process. Therefore, mass transfer is investigated in a small scale washer (Terg-O-Tometer).The process is characterized by the transfer coefficient, which is the inverse of the time constant. It is correlated using dimensional analysis with such variables as the bath volume, the water-holding capacity of the cloth load, the agitation speed, and stroke angle.Actual experiments are conducted with water-soluble substances; their results sup port the theoretical developments set forward. The transfer coefficient is directly proportional to agitation speed and stroke angle, inversey proportional to the water- holding capacity of the cloth load, and independent of the bath volume.Finally the mass transfer process is compared in a full-size machine, a small commer cial washer, and the test device by scale-up experiment. Good agreement is found, thus confirming the full-scale application of the results.

AB  - This paper aims to tackle both the challenge of illustrating the maximum power transfer theorem in a first-year course and the challenge of organizing courses with an extensive program that must be completed in a rather short time. This is the case for the three-year degree program leading to the Diploma in Electronic Systems for Telecommunications offered by the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). In this degree program, an ultrasound-based laboratory experience was developed primarily to cover the topic of maximum power transfer in the second-semester Circuit Analysis course. In this experience, the range of an ultrasonic transmitter/receiver system, which starts out rather short, is improved by using an LC matching network. The measurement setup uses low-cost circuitry and standard instrumentation available in any basic electronics laboratory. During this experience, we realized that other topics could easily be introduced, including some related to the third-semester Radiofrequency course. Therefore, we added a largely descriptive section to illustrate some of the following topics: wavelength and propagation-speed measurement, directivity, standing waves, pulse-echo distance measurement and the effect of air movement and temperature on the propagation speed.

AB  - We extend the transfer theorem of [KP2007] to the complex field. That is, we investigate the links between the class VPSPACE of families of polynomials and the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over C. Roughly speaking, a family of polynomials is in VPSPACE if its coefficients can be computed in polynomial space. Our main result is that if (uniform, constant-free) VPSPACE families can be evaluated efficiently then the class PAR of decision problems that can be solved in parallel polynomial time over the complex field collapses to P. As a result, one must first be able to show that there are VPSPACE families which are hard to evaluate in order to separate P from NP over C, or even from PAR.

AB  - SummaryThe accumulation and survival of microorganisms attached to a solid surface, is dependent on the physical characteristics of the system in which they exist, including fluid flow, mass transfer and to a lesser extent heat transfer. The conditions relating to the flow of water across a surface, particularly the velocity of flow and its distribution, have a profound effect on the colonisation of the surface by the microorganisms and the subsequent availability of nutrients. Furthermore the flow of water imposes a drag force on the biofilm with the distinct possibility that at least, some biofilm removal will occur. Mass transfer involves the movement of the microorganisms and nutrient to sustain the biofilm. It depends on the fluid flow conditions and the concentration difference between the bulk water and the biofilm. Since microbial deposits are sensitive to the prevailing temperature, heat transfer to or from a biofilm may influence sustainability.

AB  - This paper presents a formal specification and a proof of correctness for the register optimization task in high-level synthesis. A widely implemented register optimization algorithm is modeled in higher-order logic and verified in a theorem prover environment. A rich collection of correctness properties is systematically formulated during the theorem proving exercise. These properties constitute a detailed set of formal assertions that are identified with the invariants at various stages of the algorithm. The formal assertions are then embedded as programming assertions in the implementation of the register optimization algorithm in a production-strength high-level synthesis system. When turned on, the programming assertions (1) certify whether a specific run of the high-level synthesis system produced designs with error-free register allocation and, (2) in the event of a failure, help discover and isolate programming errors in the implementation. We present a detailed example and supporting experimental data to demonstrate the effectiveness of these assertions in discovering and isolating errors. Based on this experience, we discuss the role of the formal theorem proving exercise in discovering a useful set of assertions for embedding in the register optimization implementation and argue that in the absence of using the mechanical proof checking effort it would have been very hard if not impossible to discover a set of assertions so useful and expressed with such precision.

However, Einstein originally considered the case where one could define an 'element of reality', namely for the much simpler case where one could predict with certainty a definite outcome for an experiment. For this simple case, Bell's Theorem says nothing. But by using a slightly more complicated model than Bell, one can show that even in this simple case where one can make definite predictions, one still cannot generally introduce deterministic, local models to explain the results.

AB  - The &beta;-thalassemias are inherited autosomal recessive anemias, which are caused by over 200 mutations that diminish or abolish expression of the &beta;-globin gene. In the most severe forms in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes, the anemia is fatal within the first years of life in the absence of lifelong transfusion therapy. Globin gene transfer in autologous hematopoietic stem cells is a promising therapeutic option for subjects with &beta;-thalassemia major. In this approach, high level, erythroid-specific transgene expression should correct ineffective erythropoiesis following the delivery of ideally 1 or 2 copies per cell of the transferred human &beta;-globin gene. In order to increase the output of the vector encoded human globin gene, I have undertaken a systematic analysis of the contribution of the &beta;-globin promoter, HS1 and HS4 elements of the &beta;-globin locus control region (LCR) to the specificity, inducibility, long-term in vivo expression and therapeutic potential of globin lentiviral vectors. To this end, I created a panel of lentiviral vectors harboring different lengths of globin promoter, HS1 and HS4 elements of the LCR. These vectors were tested in vitro in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells and in &beta;-thalassemic mice in vivo . Transgene expression was measured at the mRNA level using quantitative primer extension and at the protein level measuring total and chimeric (mouse &alpha;2 - human &beta;2 ) hemoglobin. Expression was normalized to vector copy number obtained from southern blot and/or TaqMan analysis of the genomic DNA extracted from cells or total peripheral blood of treated animals. I show here the major roles played by the &beta;-globin promoter, HS1 and HS4 in vivo in &beta;-thalassemic mice. The 265bp promoter together with LCR containing HS2, 3 and 4 drives the highest globin expression in vitro in MEL cells but not in vivo . Promoters ranging from 130 to 1555bp vary globin expression over a 2.5-fold range. Partial deletions of HS4 reduce globin expression by 44% and, most strikingly, addition of HS1 increases &beta;-globin transgene expression by 52% leading to substantial improvement in correcting anemia in &beta;-thalassemic mice. Vector encoded globin transgene was also expressed in vitro in human Hel (Human Erythroleukemia) and K562 (Human myelogenous leukemia) cell lines as well as in human embryonic stem cells derived erythroid cells. This analysis underscores the importance of carefully analyzing the size and relative positioning of transcriptional control elements within tissue-specific vectors and the need to carefully quantify vector expression in animal models before undertaking clinical studies.

AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the movement of genetic material from one species to another, is a common phenomenon in prokaryotic evolution. Although the rate of HGT is known to vary among genes, our understanding of the cause of this variation, currently summarized by two rules, is far from complete. The first rule states that informational genes, which are involved in DNA replication, transcription, and translation, have lower transferabilities than operational genes. The second rule asserts that protein interactivity negatively impacts gene transferability. Here, we hypothesize that high expression hampers HGT, because the fitness cost of an HGT to the recipient, arising from the 1) energy expenditure in transcription and translation, 2) cytotoxic protein misfolding, 3) reduction in cellular translational efficiency, 4) detrimental protein misinteraction, and 5) disturbance of the optimal protein concentration or cell physiology, increases with the expression level of the transferred gene. To test this hypothesis, we examined laboratory and natural HGTs to Escherichia coli. We observed lower transferabilities of more highly expressed genes, even after controlling the confounding factors from the two established rules and the genic GC content. Furthermore, expression level predicts gene transferability better than all other factors examined. We also confirmed the significant negative impact of gene expression on the rate of HGTs to 127 of 133 genomes of eubacteria and archaebacteria. Together, these findings establish the gene expression level as a major determinant of horizontal gene transferability. They also suggest that most successful HGTs are initially slightly deleterious, fixed because of their negligibly low costs rather than high benefits to the recipient.

AB  - Heat transfer and fluid flow in microchannels have been topics of intense research in the past decade. A critical review of the current state of research is presented with a focus on the future research needs. After providing a brief introduction, the paper addresses six topics related to transport phenomena in microchannels: single-phase gas flow, enhancement in single-phase liquid flow and flow boiling, flow boiling instability, condensation, electronics cooling, and microscale heat exchangers. After reviewing the current status, future research directions are suggested. Concerning gas phase convective heat transfer in microchannels, the antagonist role played by the slip velocity and the temperature jump that appear at the wall are now clearly understood and quantified. It has also been demonstrated that the shear work due to the slipping fluid increases the effect of viscous heating on heat transfer. On the other hand, very few experiments support the theoretical models and a significant effort should be made in this direction, especially for measurement of temperature fields within the gas in microchannels, implementing promising recent techniques such as molecular tagging thermometry (MTT). The single-phase liquid flow in microchannels has been established to behave similar to the macroscale flows. The current need is in the area of further enhancing the performance. Progress on implementation of flow boiling in microchannels is facing challenges due to its lower heat transfer coefficients and critical heat flux (CHF) limits. An immediate need for breakthrough research related to these two areas is identified. Discussion about passive and active methods to suppress flow boiling instabilities is presented. Future research focus on instability research is suggested on developing active closed loop feedback control methods, extending current models to better predict and enable superior control of flow instabilities. Innovative high-speed visualization and measurement techniques have led to microchannel condensation now being studied as a unique process with its own governing influences. Further work is required to develop widely applicable flow regime maps that can address many fluid types and geometries. With this, condensation heat transfer models can progress from primarily annular flow based models with some adjustments using dimensionless parameters to those that can directly account for transport in intermittent and other flows, and the varying influences of tube shape, surface tension and fluid property differences over much larger ranges than currently possible. Electronics cooling continues to be the main driver for improving thermal transport processes in microchannels, while efforts are warranted to develop high performance heat exchangers with microscale passages. Specific areas related to enhancement, novel configurations, nanostructures and practical implementation are expected to be the research focus in the coming years.

AB  - We investigate from basic principles of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics the general reasons why electron transfer across an interface is associated with irreversible elements (resistances) in equivalent circuit modeling. We apply the detailed fluctuation theorem [C. Jarzynski, J. Stat. Phys. 98, 77 (2000)] to a simple model of an interface between two different materials. The elementary transition rates are interpreted in terms of the evolution of a microstate, and obey a ratio that is related to the heat absorbed from the phonon bath while promoting an electron to a higher energy level. The amount of irreversibility (the entropy production), and also the macroscopic current density, can be both obtained with the additional constraint that the system belongs in a particular mesostate, determined by the distribution of chemical and electrostatic potential.

AB  - The detection of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events has become an increasingly important issue in recent years. Here we\ndiscuss a simple theoretical analysis based on the in silico artificial addition of known foreign genes from different prokaryotic groups into the genome of Escherichia coli K12 MG1655. Using this dataset as a control, we have tested the efficiency of four methodologies commonly employed to detect\nHGT, which are based on (a) the codon adaptation index, codon usage, and GC percentage (CAI/GC); (b) the distributional profile\n(DP) approach with a gene search in the closely related phylogenetic genomes; (c) the Bayesian model (BM); and (d) the first-order\nMarkov model (MM). All methods exhibit limitations as shown here, with BM and MM giving better approximations. The MM has\na better detection rate when genes from closely related organisms are evaluated. The application of the MM to detect recently\ntransferred genes in the genomes of E. coli strain K12 MG1655 shows that this organism has undergone a rather significant amount of HGT, several of which have well-defined\nfunctions that appear to be involved in the direct interaction of the organisms with their environment.

AB  - The GABARAPL1 (GABARAP-LIKE 1) gene was first described as an early estrogen-regulated gene that shares a high sequence homology with GABARAP and is thus a part of the GABARAP family. GABARAPL1, like GABARAP, interacts with the GABAA receptor and tubulin and promotes tubulin polymerization. The GABARAP family members (GABARAP, GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2) and their close homologs (LC3 and Atg8) are not only involved in the transport of proteins or vesicles but are also implicated in various mechanisms such as autophagy, cell death, cell proliferation and tumor progression. However, despite these similarities, GABARAPL1 displays a complex regulation that is different from that of other GABARAP family members. Moreover, it presents a regulated tissue expression and is the most highly expressed gene among the family in the central nervous system. In this review article, we will outline the specific functions of this protein and also hypothesize about the roles that GABARAPL1 might have in several important biological processes such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - In 1931, the young Kurt Gödel published his First Incompleteness Theorem, which tells us that, for any sufficiently rich theory of arithmetic, there are some arithmetical truths the theory cannot prove. This remarkable result is among the most intriguing (and most misunderstood) in logic. Gödel also outlined an equally significant Second Incompleteness Theorem. How are these Theorems established, and why do they matter? Peter Smith answers these questions by presenting an unusual variety of proofs for the First Theorem, showing how to prove the Second Theorem, and exploring a family of related results (including some not easily available elsewhere). The formal explanations are interwoven with discussions of the wider significance of the two Theorems. This book will be accessible to philosophy students with a limited formal background.

AB  - The limited usefulness of the maximum power transfer theorem in practice is argued. Inappropriately, the utility and value of the maximum power transfer theorem are often elevated to be religious icons of electrical engineering. While the theorem appears to be useful, often in real circuits the load impedance is not set equal to the complex conjugate of the equivalent impedance of the connecting source. When the load impedance happens to be equal to the complex conjugate of the source impedance, other practical reasons for this type of impedance matching exists, other than effecting maximum power transfer. Some reasons are discussed in a straightforward fashion.

Ivanov and D. Babikov, J. Chem. Phys. 134, 144107 (2011)], and a more rigorous method based on the Ehrenfest theorem. It is shown analytically that for the case of a diatomic molecule + quencher these two methods are entirely equivalent. Notably, they both make use of the average moment of inertia computed as inverse of average of inverse of the distributed moment of inertia. Despite this equivalence, each of the two formulations has its own advantages, and is interesting on its own. Numerical results presented here illustrate energy and momentum conservation in the mixed quantum∕classical approach and open opportunities for computationally affordable treatment of collisional energy transfer.

AB  - The model of timed I/O automata represents an extension of the model of I/O automata with the aim of reasoning about realtime systems. A number of case studies using timed I/O automata has been carried out, among them a treatment of the so-called Generalized Railroad Crossing (GRC). An already existing formalization of the metatheory of I/O automata within Isabelle/HOLCF allows for fully formal tool-supported verification using I/O automata. We present a modification of this formalization which accomodates for reasoning about timed I/O automata. The guiding principle in choosing the parts of the metatheory of timed I/O automata to formalize has been to provide all the theory necessary for formalizing the solution to the GRC. This leads to a formalization of the GRC, in which not only the correctness proof itself has been formalized, but also the underlying meta-theory of timed I/O automata, on which the correctness proof is based.

We outline the correctness proof for concrete kernels, which implement this model. This result represents a crucial step towards the verification of a kernel, e.g. that in the academic system. We report on the current status of the formal verification.

AB  - We present the DRIVER system for designing, analyzing and implementing network protocols. DRIVER leverages declarative net- working, a recent innovation that enables network protocols to be con- cisely specified and implemented using declarative languages. DRIVER takes as input declarative networking specifications written in the Net- work Datalog (NDlog) query language, and maps that automatically into logical specifications that can be directly used in existing theorem provers to validate protocol correctness. As an alternative approach, net- work designer can supply a component-based model of their routing de- sign, automatically generate PVS specifications for verification and sub- sequent compilation into verified declarative network implementations. We demonstrate the use of DRIVER for synthesizing and verifying a variety of well-known network routing protocols.

AB  - T here comes a time when owner-managers of small fi rms choose, or are forced, to retire. This decision gives rise to a business transfer decision, where the owner-manager must decide whether to transfer the business to a family member, sell the business or shut down the business. While this transfer choice is a key business decision which impacts on the long-run survival and profi tability of the fi rm and the region in which it is located, little is known about what factors infl uence the owner-manager’s decision. In this paper, we explore how fi rm and regional characteristics impact the transfer decision. Using evidence collected from in-depth interviews with Irish and Scottish (N=236) owner-managers, we fi nd that whilst factors such as the size and location of the fi rm have the same impact on owner-managers in both countries, the importance of other factors such as sector, gender, the existence of an exit plan and the owner-manager’s intentions for the fi rm differ. We emphasise the need to put incentive mechanisms in place to increase the attractiveness of purchasing a viable small business.

AB  - Oseledets' celebrated Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem (MET) is concerned with the exponential growth rates of vectors under the action of a linear cocycle on R^d. When the linear actions are invertible, the MET guarantees an almost-everywhere pointwise splitting of R^d into subspaces of distinct exponential growth rates (called Lyapunov exponents). When the linear actions are non-invertible, Oseledets' MET only yields the existence of a filtration of subspaces, the elements of which contain all vectors that grow no faster than exponential rates given by the Lyapunov exponents. The authors recently demonstrated that a splitting over R^d is guaranteed even without the invertibility assumption on the linear actions. Motivated by applications of the MET to cocycles of (non-invertible) transfer operators arising from random dynamical systems, we demonstrate the existence of an Oseledets splitting for cocycles of quasi-compact non-invertible linear operators on Banach spaces.

AB  - This paper has proposed an approach to searching for the minimum of molecular orbital (MO) energy splitting factor, and obtaining the electron transfer (ET) matrix element in long-range electron transfer reactions. This method has been applied to the intramolecular electron transfer reactions between biphenyl anion radical and biphenyl as well as naphthalene, mediated by the 5-??-androstane bridge. The electron transfer matrix element can be determined by the minimum location of the MO energy splitting factor between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and the next lowest unoccupied molecular orbital based on Koopmans' theorem, Such a method is of special interest for asymmetric electron transfer systems in which the excess electron or hole transfers from one site to another. This paper has investigated the orientation dependence of the MO energy splitting factor for the co-axis self-exchange system of biphenyl anion radical and biphenyl. The values of ET matrix elements obtained using Koopmans' theorem have been discussed in contrast to the state overlap on the basis of two-state model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The spatial averaging theorem is applied to rigorously derive continuum-scale equations of radiative transfer in two-phase media consisting of arbitrary-type phases in the limit of geometrical optics. The derivations are based on the equations of radiative transfer and the corresponding boundary conditions applied at the discrete-scale to each phase, and on the discrete-scale radiative properties of each phase and the interface between the phases. The derivations confirm that radiative transfer in two-phase media consisting of arbitrary-type phases in the range of geometrical optics can be modeled by a set of two continuum-scale equations of radiative transfer describing the variation of the average intensities associated with each phase. Finally, a Monte Carlo based methodology for the determination of average radiative properties is discussed in the light of previous pertinent studies. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interactive proof assistants should verify the proofs they receive from automatic theorem provers. Normally this proof reconstruction takes place internally, forming part of the integration between the two tools. We have implemented source-level proof reconstruction: resolution proofs are automatically translated to Isabelle proof scripts. Users can insert this text into their proof development or (if they wish) examine it manually. Each step of a proof is justified by calling Hurd's Metis prover, which we have ported to Isabelle. A recurrent issue in this project is the treatment of Isabelle's axiomatic type classes.

OCL is currently under development within an open standardization process within the OMG; our work is an attempt to accompany this process by a proposal solving open questions in a consistent way and exploring alternatives of the language design. Moreover, our encoding gives the foundation for tool supported reasoning over OCL specifications, for example as basis for test case generation.

AB  - Two competing views of regulating glottal airflow for maximum vocal output are investigated theoretically. The maximum power transfer theorem is used as a guide. A wide epilarynx tube (laryngeal vestibule) matches well with low glottal resistance (believed to correspond to the "yawn-sigh" approach in voice therapy), whereas a narrow epilarynx tube matches well with a higher glottal resistance (believed to correspond to the "twang-belt" approach). A simulation model is used to calculate mean flows, peak flows, and oral radiated pressure for an impedance ratio between the vocal tract (the load) and the glottis (the source). Results show that when the impedance ratio approaches 1.0, maximum power is transferred and radiated from the mouth. A full update of the equations used for simulating driving pressures, glottal flow, and vocal tract input pressures is provided as a programming guide for those interested in model development.

AB  - The two coplanar elliptic-to-elliptic orbits transfer with two-impulse is considered in this paper. The problem is the rendezvous of two spacecrafts, and the target spacecraft is not fixed in its orbit, but keep moving as same as the tracing spacecraft. To solve the problem, the transfer time is computed using Lambertpsilas theorem and iterative algorithm. And improved genetic algorithm is also used to optimize objective function, which is the tradeoff between minimum-time and minimum-fuel. The other method to solve the problem uses improved genetic algorithm and Lambertpsilas theorem, which avoids the iterative algorithm. The simulations and orbital figures of simulation results show the feasibility and validity of the arithmetic proposed in this paper.

AB  -  The maximum power transfer theorem for DC linear two-ports terminated by uncoupled passive resistors is stated and proved. Unlike all previous works, non-reciprocal two-ports (i.e. two-ports whose resistance matrix is non-symmetrical) are allowed, and power is maximized with respect to the load resistances rather than the load currents. Further, the approach developed is variational instead of direct (i.e. based on the theory of quadratic forms), and thus yields considerable side information on the global behaviour of the circuit. Although calculations are more involved than in the case of one-ports, final results are relatively simple.

AB  - Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to conveniently use ordinary real number expressions within proof assistants? In this paper we outline how this can be done within a theorem proving framework. First, we formally establish upper and lower bounds for trigonometric and transcendental functions. Then, based on these bounds, we develop a rational interval arithmetic where real number calculations can be performed in an algebraic setting. This pragmatic approach has been implemented as a strategy in PVS. The strategy provides a safe way to perform explicit calculations over real numbers in formal proofs.

AB  - We verify within the Coq proof assistant that ML typing is sound with respect to the dynamic semantics. We prove this property in the framework of a big step semantics and also in the framework of a reduction semantics. For that purpose, we use a syntax-directed version of the typing rules: we prove mechanically its equivalence with the initial type system provided by Damas and Milner. This work is complementary to the certification of the ML type inference algorithm done previously by the author and Val{é}rie M{é}nissier-Morain.

AB  - A new version of nonstationary radiative transfer theory for vector electromagnetic wave multiple scattering in a discrete random medium is presented in which the electromagnetic energy within dielectric scatterers may be large. The starting point is the general two frequency Bethe-Salpeter equation for the coherence tenser-function of the wave electric field. In the two frequency domain it is proved that the Poynting's theorem can be decomposed into (1) a theorem for the spectral component of the electric energy density multiplied by two and (2) a theorem for the difference between the spectral components of the electric and the magnetic energy densities. The Poynting's theorem is closely connected with a generalized two-frequency Ward-Takahashi identity according to which the extinction of a nonsteady radiation is conditioned by the incoherent scattering, the real absorption and changing of the energy accumulation inside scatterers. As result a new radiative transfer equation is obtained for the radiance tensor of a pulse radiation in unbounded random medium. This equation differs from the traditional one by a term with the time derivative where the inverse value of the group velocity is replaced by a tenser-operator which determines the average rate of the electromagnetic energy change within scatterers.

AB  - The transfer of new technologies (e.g., evidence-based practices) into substance abuse treatment organizations often occurs long after they have been developed and shown to be effective. Transfer is slowed, in part, due to a lack of clear understanding about all that is needed to achieve full implementation of these technologies. Such misunderstanding is exacerbated by inconsistent terminology and overlapping models of an innovation, including its development and validation, dissemination to the public, and implementation or use in the field. For this reason, a workgroup of the Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC) Network developed a field-driven conceptual model of the innovation process that more precisely defines relevant terms and concepts and integrates them into a comprehensive taxonomy. The proposed definitions and conceptual framework will allow for improved understanding and consensus regarding the distinct meaning and conceptual relationships between dimensions of the technology transfer process and accelerate the use of evidence-based practices. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The experience of community college transfer students at four-year institutions has been well documented by studies characterizing their adjustment process as "transfer shock." A popular paradigm, the transfer shock concept only describes the cognitive outcome of students' academic adjustment as measured by GPA. Numerous researchers have utilized various instruments to collect data from transfer students to assess their experiences at four-year institutions. Many of these studies have focused on traditional outcome measures such as levels of engagement, involvement with faculty and campus life, and satisfaction. Only recently have researchers been interested in attempting to uncover the psychosocial experiences of transfer students at four-year institutions. The objective of this article is to add to the literature by describing the Laanan-Transfer Students' Questionnaire (L-TSQ) Â© , which can be utilized as a data collection tool to better understand transfer students' adjustment process at four-year institutions. The purpose of this article is three-fold: (1) to provide the theoretical framework guiding the development and design of the L-TSQ; (2) to discuss the instrumentation and psychometric properties of the L-TSQ; and (3) to articulate the benefits of the L-TSQ with respect to research and policy implications. The goal of this article is to provide new ways of studying transfer students at four-year institutions. With the increasing diversity among transfer students, assessment of their experiences would yield valuable benefits to researchers, student affairs professionals, faculty, and administrators at both the two- and four-year environments.
