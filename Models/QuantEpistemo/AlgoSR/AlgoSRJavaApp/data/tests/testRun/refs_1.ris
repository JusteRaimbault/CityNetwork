AB  - The ever increasing negative impact of global warming has reminded all\nof us in transportation professionals the importance of low carbon\nemission transportation system design, planning, and practices. With\nurbanization accelerating in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and other parts of\nthe world, building a sustainable multi-modal transportation network to\naccommodate the residents' transportation needs and cut down greenhouse\ngas emissions in cities around the world has become a very important\nchallenge. The purpose of this paper is to showcase the successful\nstories of cities who are meeting this challenge head on by building\nsustainable multi-modal transportation network. Six major cities in\nthree continents that the authors personally visited will be showcased\nin this paper. From Europe, we have Paris, France and London, England.\nFrom Asia, we have Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan. From America, we have New\nYork City and San Francisco. Lessons learned from these six cities were\nsummarized and presented in this paper. Hong Kong comes out on top and\nis recognized as the most sustainable multi-modal transportation network\ndesign. It is believed that success can be duplicated if the process is\nclearly documented and benefits truly understood by all transportation\nprofessionals.

AB  - This paper presents the ground work necessary to study the evolving air transportation industry. A survey of related models based on a system-of-systems perspective results in a methodology formulated to address overlooked areas such as market coordination and competition. An agent-based modeling approach underpins the integration of the demand-side (consumers) and supply-side (service providers) entities to effectively capture the dynamic interactions between these stakeholders within the National Transportation System. Machine Learning techniques are adopted to model the competitive sentience of air service providers in making decisions that affect consumers' travel demand over time and vice versa. An interim model is developed employing this methodology on a four-node, inter-city transportation network, and has shown promising results toward further development efforts.

AB  - A wide range of energy forms are being consumed, including natural gas (NG) for industrial uses and heating, electricity for light and to power electronic devices, petrochemicals to produce plastics, and petroleum derivatives such as gasoline and diesel for transportation. Because modern life is based on energy, individuals, corporations, and firms should have a reliable access to energy in all its forms. Problems involving the continuous transportation and delivery of energy can lead to the disruption and breakdown of economic, industrial, and social infrastructures. An energy resource cannot be reliable unless, first, it is delivered to right place at the right time, and secondly, it must be available in the consumer-desired quantity. Maintaining the efficient and reliable generation, transportation, and distribution of energy is the most important in a world, which is so dependent on energy. Different kinds of energy are used in today's industries and in people's lives. Some are fossil fuel resources such as oil and gas, but electricity, nuclear energy, solar energy resources, wind energy, and wave energy are also being used. All of these types should be delivered to consumers. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - "As traditional sources of funding for the nation's surface transportation system fail to keep pace with demand, proposals for new sources have proliferated. New funding strategies, such as pricing the use of new and existing roads, and new institutional arrangements, such as public-private partnerships, have emerged over the past few years. As with all transportation policies, these strategies raise questions about equity. To address these concerns, the Transportation Research Board convened an expert committee to provide guidance to public officials about assessing the equity of evolving transportation finance mechanisms. The committee's findings are presented in this report. They are organized under the following chapter headings: (1) Equity and Transportation Finance; (2) How Transportation is Funded and Who Pays; (3) Equity Through Different Lenses; (4) Transportation Finance Equity: Evidence and Experience; (5) Equity and Decision Making: Experience with Road Pricing; and (6) Findings and Recommendations."--pub. desc.

AB  - Computer simulation plays an increasingly important role in engineering education as a tool for enhancing classroom learning. This research investigates the efficacy of using simulation in teaching the topic of transportation network growth through an experiment conducted at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota. In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - This study focuses on grasping the spatial changes that have taken place in a provincial city and aims to clarify the decision making processes of administrators and public transportation companies in Nagano City from a spatial point of view. Geographic studies of public transportation can be divided into two categories: those that put the emphasis on the spatial analysis of the network, and those that are descriptive accounts of the development of transportation in a community. This study attempts to clarify the spatiotemporal nodal structure, taking into account both the spatial profile and transitions over time. Metrical analysis and historical description, two previously separate methodologies, were combined to achieve this objective. Specifically, we first performed an analysis of the spatial structure of the public transportation network as it has gone through yearly changes. Then we examined how the decision making of the administrative and contracting arms has progressed in response to these changes. Finally, we looked into the influence such decisions have had on changes in public transportation. Factor analysis, based on the number of bus and railway runs flow, was used to clarify the changes in nodal structures. These results were then used to compare the convenience of public transportation in various districts in the city with consideration of the population distribution. As a result, with the exception of the central area of Nagano City where buses and railways are concentrated, the nodal structure on the whole experienced a simplification in the decade from 1990 to 2000 due to the decrease in inter-district connections. The disparity in the convenience of public transportation between the central and surrounding districts has also grown due to the deteriorating connections in surrounding districts. However, this gap was also likely subject to the influence of the Nagano Olympics and the extension of the Nagano Shinkansen in the central part of the city. Although the administration has been trying to reduce the number of areas with poor public transit access to minimize the disparity, which has increased due to the change in network spatial patterns, to date it has continued to give priority to ensuring access for citizens traveling in the central urban areas. Currently, given the fact that the number of passengers is not expected to increase, railway companies are focusing on increasing the carrying capacity and linking the rail transportation with other types of transportation in some of the busier zones. Also, bus companies are reducing and eliminating/merging some routes, while trying to maintain the existing service lines, which are still in high demand. The administration is encouraging policies to reduce poor-access areas, whereas the transportation companies are trying to improve the efficiency of the existing network, and although both are working toward improvement, differences of opinion are bound to occur because of the different strategies. In conclusion, to understand the spatial pattern change in public transportation, it is necessary not only to follow the tendencies over time but also to have a clear view of the decisions made and especially policies formed by the administration and the companies.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin-destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin-destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - In 1997, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) will be reauthorized, and the formula for distributing federal highway funds to states is likely to be a key issue in the reauthorization process. One reason for the upcoming formula debate is that the current allocation process is not reflective of current federal objectives in transportation. Alternative proposals for distributing federal highway funds have already been introduced to Congress. ISTEA reauthorization will provide Congress with an opportunity to review the federal objectives in transportation and to reflect these objectives in the distribution of federal highway funds to states. In preparation for this debate, alternative scenarios for distributing federal highway funds are explored, and the scenarios are evaluated on the basis of the present overarching federal objectives in transportation. Included in this process is an evaluation of formula factors, such as lane miles and vehicle miles traveled, that make up individual scenarios. The goal is to encourage debate on and add to the discussion of how federal highway funds are or should be distributed to states.

AB  -  Having not considered such aspects as spatial distribution features of transportation networks and resident areas, the spatial influence of outside transportation modes on the features within the research regions as well as the different transit capacity of different transportation ways, the conventional measuring methods based on path analysis and network analysis are deficient to the description of regional transportation situation. With the employment and optimization of the connectivity and accessibility of the network nodes to evaluate transportation network, this study successfully breaks through the limitation of the border of investigative area and, different transportation modes can also be taken into account. Based on the gradually increased correlation coefficient between the connectivity change, which is a gradually increased process from direct connections to indirect multi-steps connections, and the development of regional economy, this paper proposes economy-network diameter index (ENDI), which is employed to evaluate the development of network and the contribution to regional economy of Gansu Province, China with the data of 2002 transportation network and the economic statistics in the Statistical Yearbook. By above methods, this empirical study comes to the following conclusions: 1) interregional transportation contributes more to the development of regional economic than that of the adjoining transportation; and 2) these indices can be used to designate spatial interactional scopes of regional economy, and accordingly to provide powerful and scientific supports for the planning of regional transportation and economy; and 3) the accessibility figure of network nodes shows that transportation of Gansu Province takes on a phenomenon of high cluster and spatial autocorrelation; and 4) ENDI can also be used to create spatial weight matrix of spatial progress. As calculation of these indices is laborious, several efficient computational methods are developed.

The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

These modular networks are effective in synchronizing their components

The goal was to assess the present status of Vietnamese academic libraries in Vietnam's higher education as well as national development, especially in the areas of scientific development. This study is the result of my visits to major Vietnamese academic and public libraries, a survey of several academic libraries, and discussions I had with Vietnamese library leadership, either in person or through e-mail exchanges in July and August 2003. Needless to say, this study is far from comprehensive. Nonetheless, it identifies the salient challenges facing Vietnamese academic libraries. It also contends that Vietnam will not succeed in its modernization effort, especially in developing a knowledge-based economy, unless Vietnam is ready to devote not only a vast amount of resource to modernize its academic libraries but also to radically transform its outdated its higher education's curricular, for they are intricately linked. While this study focuses on Vietnamese academic libraries, it also brings to light to a great extend the major common challenges (lack of well-trained library professionals, modern library facilities, shortage of up-to-date scientific resources, government owned and operated universities and publishing houses, censorship, outdated instructional methods, etc.) facing academic libraries in many developing countries, especially transforming socialist states. Thus this study, albeit preliminary, should be of interest to many of these countries as well.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables.

AB  - Network Design Problem (NDP) is one of the important problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems. In general, decision making in rail freight transportation has three main levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. In the field of rail freight transportation planning, MCND occurs in all levels of decision making such as car blocking, train makeup, and empty car distribution. This paper presents a review of MCND problems modeling, their applications in rail freight transportation planning, and solution methods which have been developed to solve them.

AB  - We examine the freight transportation problem which occurs when the same authority controls and plans both the supply of transportation services (modes, routes, frequencies for the services and classification, consolidation, transfer policies for terminals) and the routing of freight. We present a general modeling framework, based on a network optimization model, which may be used to assist and enhance the tactical and strategic planning process for such a system. The problem is solved by means of an algorithm, described in some detail, based on decomposition and column generation principles. We also present detailed results on the behaviour and performance of the algorithm, as observed during experimentation with a specific rail application.

AB  - Although many of the problems that Cali is experiencing - social and human capital deterioration, a declining economy, and institutional crisis - are a reflection of Colombia s complicated socioeconomic situation, the city has been hit harder by the crisis than other large cities, as confirmed by the following indicators: GDP, unemployment, poverty rate, inequality, and number of homicides. According to recent estimates, the population in Cali reached the 2 million level in 1999, making the city the second largest in the country after Bogota. Internal migration increased significantly during the early 90s due to the economic boom generated by drug dealing activities, and continued in the last part of the decade, due to resettlement movements of large population groups, affected by social conflict in rural areas. However, migration flows have generated social tension in the city, as economic opportunities became scarce. The Bank engaged in a participatory process to produce a City Development Strategy (CDS), whose specific objectives are to help the city administration and stakeholders identify a strategy to overcome the current crisis, and, be a neutral facilitator in the reconstruction process. The CDS is being developed in four stages: 1) identification of the main problems; 2) development of the analytical framework; 3) dissemination of results; and, 4) development of a financial plan.

AB  - A bilevel formulation is developed to identify vulnerable transportation\nnetwork links. The problem can be viewed as a game between an ``evil\nentity{''} and the traffic management agency. At the lower level, the\ntraffic management agency routes vehicles according to the system of\noptimal traffic assignment. At the upper level, the evil entity seeks to\nmaximize disruption to the network. A key component of this formulation\nis the vulnerability index, which is a measure of the importance of a\nspecific link to the connectivity of an origin-destination pair. The\nvulnerability index accounts for the availability of alternate paths,\nexcess capacity, and travel time. The vulnerability indices are\naggregated across all origin-destination pairs into the disruption\nindex. This disruption index is the measure of damage to the network by\nwhich the evil entity might rank links as targets. Because the evil\nentity has a limited amount of resources, it cannot strike all of the\npotential targets and must choose among subsets of links. Four cases\nwith different types of information availability for the evil entity and\nthe traffic management agency are examined for a simple network. In each\ncase, the evil entity is assumed to aim its strike at the link that has\nthe potential to carry traffic for the most origin-destination pairs.

AB  - The structure and layout of an urban transportation network have decisive effects on urban logistics operation efficiency. The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

AB  - In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of determining optimal paths for routing an undesirable vehicle on a network embedded on an Euclidean plane. A typical application is the transporting of hazardous materials. Demand points, or population centers, are discretely distributed at nodes and continuously distributed on straight-line links of the network. The objective is to find, without incorporating the probability of accidental leakage of hazardous material, a path that minimizes the weighted sum of lengths over which this vehicle is within a threshold distance λ of population centers. By appropriately redefining link lengths, we can use a shortest-path algorithm to solve the problem. Special properties of the objective function allow us to efficiently calculate the modified link lengths. We discuss the properties of the optimal routing strategy and the objective value, and offer an economic interpretation of the case when λ varies. Operating within the framework of risk analysis, we integrate the probability of accidental release of hazardous material into our basic model. The routing objective becomes the minimization of expected damage, where accidental leakage of hazardous materials can inflict damage within a neighborhood λ of the accident site. We also discuss our computational experience in using the model.

AB  - Should we invest in all the transportation projects with positive net present value (NPV)? This paper builds upon a model to assist the social planner to optimally invest on the growth of the transportation network and demonstrates the answer to this question is no. The initial model, based on the Williams’ model (1) is an extension of the real option theory to the investment in transportation projects. Subject to technical, social and environmental limitations, which lead to a certain level of quality, the social planner may determine both the date and the capacity at which to improve the transportation network. The value of development of transportation projects as real options is based on the stochastic processes for the social operating revenues (including externalities) and the construction costs. After this, the initial model is modified by defining a generalized diffusion process for the state variable “ratio of social operating revenues over construction costs” that accounts for mean-reversion. The improved model allows the process of the only state variable to describe real transportation finance cases much better than the initial model because its drift is not constant but reverting to the mean of the process. Closed form analytic solutions for both the initial and the improved models are found and discussed.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - The term ‘sustainable transportation development’ is a combination of sustainable development and transportation. As a concept, it involves the application of the sustainable development idea to transportation systems. This paper deals with how the concept of sustainability is currently used and how it should be used in the future engineering of transportation systems. First, the current definitions of sustainable development are reviewed and it is shown that there is a need for definition and criteria that can be used by engineers for planning, design and operation of transportation systems. Second, the current approaches of sustainability in transportation planning are reviewed and discussed. Subsequently, it is proposed that the focus should be on a sustainably developed transportation system, i.e. a system that meets the people’s needs, with the available or affordable environmental, financial and social resources. Finally, it is shown that a sustainably developed transportation problem is basically a mathematical problem. Keywords Sustainable development, transportation engineering, optimisation problem Introduction There appears to be a consensus of opinion that the current pattern of transportation growth is not desirable. The reader will agree that the rate of the world’s motor vehicle fleet growth, in the developed as well as in the developing world, is threatening our human, social and economic well being. Quality of life, levels of basic freedom, health, education, access to – and distribution of – resources, etc.are in danger. Reasons for this are inter alia the environmental and safety impacts of transportation, and the dependence of land uses on the financial resources for construction and maintenance of its associated infrastructure both in the short- and long-term. Sustainable development has been the topic of many conferences and activities by transportation professionals and international agencies. Despite the attention given, the concept still lacks clarity for certain groups of stakeholders, for example transportation engineers and planners. This paper deals with how the sustainability concept is currently used in transportation engineering and planning, and how it should be rationalised in the future for the planning, design and operation of transportation systems.

AB  - Optimal network design for transportation corridors of regional space groups is studied by using combinatorial optimization. The optimal investment model of multimodal transportation corridors is formulated by establishing supply capacity constraint and travel time constraint of transportation corridors. The unit investment cost and the length of transportation corridors is synthetically considered in the model. A method is designed by considering the characteristics of multimodal transportation corridors and the network structure of regional groups, and computational schemes are provided. The efficiency of solution is improved by using a genetic algorithm for large number of nodes. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model and the algorithm is verified through examples, which indicate that the optimal investment scheme is identified to meet transportation demands for planning and the average travel time of each transportation mode. The relationship between transportation demands and transportation corridor design is analyzed, and the results indicate that the model and the solution could be a promising approach to improving the traffic investment programs.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - GM production is up, but that doesn't mean Latin Americans like or want it, say Luisa Massarani, Ildeu de Castro Moreira and  Ana Maria Vara*.\n\nA report launched by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) in March 2010 paints a rosy picture of small-scale farmers embracing — and benefitting from — genetic modification (GM) technology at a rapid pace (see GM crops flourishing in developing world, says report).\n\nBut recent research from China shows that wide planting of GM cotton has caused a surge in pests (see Bt cotton linked with surge in crop pest).\n\nOur experience in Brazil and Argentina — both among the world's top producers of GM crops — similarly indicates that growth in GM crop production has guaranteed neither wide-scale social acceptance of the technology nor benefits for small-scale farmers.\n\nEarly acclaim\n\nIt is true that when, in the late 1990s, international agribusiness Monsanto introduced Argentina to Roundup Ready soya (a crop designed to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate), politicians and many commercialfarmers welcomed it with open arms.\n\nVery early on, multinational corporations and farmers' associations began an intense promotional campaign for GM crops, trading on the country's view of itself as a leading grain producer.\n\nJust one government office was responsible for GM crops, and this helped ensure the legal system didn't pose any obstacles. In fact, the issue of GM food was never really put up for public debate.\n\nAnd Monsanto's GM soya arrived in Argentina when the country was entering a major economic crisis, and agricultural income was badly needed.\n\nThere were other favourable economic factors too. Monsanto didn't have a monopoly over the technology because it could not patent its Roundup Ready soya in Argentina. Also, glyphosate was no longer under patent; field machinery was easily accessible under contract; and to GM needed less field labour compared with non-GM soya.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, GM soya was highly profitable, especially when combined with non-till practices and an increase in agro-chemical use. All these factors contributed GM soya's rapid penetration into Argentinean agriculture.\n\nBut our interviews and focus groups with about 50 Argentinean small-scale farmers in 2007revealed concern about the social changes the switch to GM soya causes. GM profits for many came not from growing the crop themselves, but from renting their land to commercial farmers for large-scale production.\n\nThis threatens sustainability because it increases small-scale farmers' reliance on external parties for their income, and can also mean both agricultural skills and land fertility are lost.\n\nBattle for Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the opposition to GM crops has been much more overt, with Monsanto's move to introduce Roundup Ready soya sparking almost a decade of controversies and legal disputes.\n\nAs early as 1998the Worker's Party — the main opposition party at the time— adopted an anti-GM stance. Some state governments too, for example in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná, ideologically opposed GM crops and even implemented local legislation to prohibit them.\n\nEnvironmental groupsand social movements, such as Greenpeace and the Movement of the Landless Rural Workers, also took up anti-GM positions and were much more vocal and active in campaigning against GM crops than their Argentinean counterparts.\n\nAnd if political divisions have characterised the GM debate in Brazil, so too have divisions within the scientific community.\n\nThe community generally supported research into GM crops. The Brazilian Academy of Science also supported growing them. But several prominent scientists, including Glaci Zancan, then president of the Brazilian Association for the Advancement of Science, opposed commercial GM crops in the absence of long-term studies on health and environmental impacts.  \n\nOvercoming opposition\n\nDespite the controversy and criticism, GM crop cultivation has expanded rapidly in Brazil, even before it was legally approved in 2005. Our focus groups and individual interviews with about 80 Brazilian stakeholders and approximately 200 small-scale farmers reveal many reasons for this growth.\n\nThey include the use of non-approved GM seeds illegally brought over from Argentina; a curiosity for testing new seeds; pressures to keep the harvest as economically productive as possible; and the fact that, in some regions, conventional soya seeds are becoming hard to find.\n\nBut more important than these factors has been the clever tactics employed by the pro-GM lobby, which even include — according to some of our interviewees — doling out free GM seeds.\n\nThe most significant move was the tactic that got GM soya legalised in 2005. The pro-GM lobby got the issue of stem cell research onto the same bill as GM soya — the biosafety law. This move capitalised on the much broader support among politicians, scientists and the public for stem cell research.\n\nThe strategy worked — the bill was passed by parliament by 352 votes to 60, and officially enabled the production and sale of GM soya in Brazil.\n\nBut the debate is far from over. There are still strong tensions around GM within government, and small-scale farmers remain unconvinced. Our research found a strong demand for unbiased information on GM crops and three national surveys also found a lack of acceptance of GM crops, even among farmers growing GM soya. Indeed, a common refrain among those we interviewed was "I'm happy to grow it, but I wouldn't eat it".\n\nIn Latin America, as in many developing regions of the world, the GM debate is 'messy'. There is a danger in interpreting a simple increase in GM crop cultivation as a sign that countries are wholeheartedly in favour of the technology, or that acceptance and benefits are widespread.\n\nLuisa Massarani is Latin America and Caribbean coordinator for SciDev.Net and researcher at Museum of Life, House of Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz, Brazil.\n\nIldeu de Castro Moreira is a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAna Maria Vara is a researcher at the National University of San Martín, Argentina.\n\n*The authors thank Carla Almeida and Fabio Gouveia for their contributions to both this article and the research project it mentions, which was supported by the International Development Research Centre

The potential of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped. Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining of transportation network graphs: we hope to find how current techniques both succeed and fail on this problem, and from the failures, we hope to present new challenges for data mining. Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data mining techniques to real transportation network data are provided, including new approaches to making these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are not appropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate research and galvanize future work in this area.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-modal freight transportation model based on a digitized geographic network. A systematic analysis and decomposition of all the transport operations, i.e. moving, loading and unloading, transshipping and transiting, leads to the development of a virtual network where each virtual link corresponds to a specific operation, and all transportation modes and means are inter-linked. Software, called NODUS, automatically generates the virtual network so that the model can be conveniently applied to large networks. The analytical structure of the links notation makes it easy to attach specific cost functions to each virtual link. The model is applied to the trans-European freight network of roads, railways and inland waterways for the transportation of wood. Cost functions are built up for each operation by each mode/means combination. A detailed point-to-point origin-destination matrix, calibrated on Eurostat statistics, is generated by a Monte-Carlo technique. Then, the total transportation cost is minimized with respect to the choices of routes, modes and means. This provides estimations of transportation services demands as well as modal splits, to the extent that the two hypotheses of demand based on generalized cost minimization and market contestability are accepted. A sensitivity analysis on the relative road cost is made, which provides measures of arc-elasticities. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - Although many of the problems that Cali is experiencing - social and human capital deterioration, a declining economy, and institutional crisis - are a reflection of Colombia ' s complicated socioeconomic situation, the city has been hit harder by the crisis than other large cities, as confirmed by the following indicators: GDP, unemployment, poverty rate, inequality, and number of homicides. According to recent estimates, the population in Cali reached the 2 million level in 1999, making the city the second largest in the country after Bogota. Internal migration increased significantly during the early 90s due to the economic boom generated by drug dealing activities, and continued in the last part of the decade, due to resettlement movements of large population groups, affected by social conflict in rural areas. However, migration flows have generated social tension in the city, as economic opportunities became scarce. The Bank engaged in a participatory process to produce a City Development Strategy (CDS), whose specific objectives are to help the city administration and stakeholders identify a strategy to overcome the current crisis, and, be a neutral facilitator in the reconstruction process. The CDS is being developed in four stages: 1) identification of the main problems; 2) development of the analytical framework; 3) dissemination of results; and, 4) development of a financial plan.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

AB  - In the first part of this paper, the framework of the Dutch Integral Transportation Study is given. and the position of the defining of the road network is pointed out. In the second part, the transport network optimization problem is stated formally and the algorithm devised to solve this problem is described. The problem is formed by the minimization of the total costs (investments and users costs) for the transport of a given tripmatrix by choice of the dimensions and flows of the links of a transport network. The solution method has been devised especially in order to overcome the computational dificulties at large networks. It gives a reasonable solution in a relatively very short computation time. To that end the problem is decomposed into a number of sub-problems. yielding the optimal relationship between the dimension and the traffic flow for each link. and a master problem assigning the flows to the network in such a way that the objective function is minimized. In the third part the application of this method to the optimization of the Dutch road network is described.

AB  - This work builds further on the Orbital Transportation Network Analysis methodology proposed by the authors in earlier research. Through a review of the literature of flexibility, the different types of flexibility that can apply to an orbital transportation network, and their relationships to the system architecture, are explored. Finally a provider- side flexibility metric is defined as a combination of the different types of flexibilities. The resulting metric can then be used in addition to performance and value metrics to rank the best architectures for the orbital transportation network. It is argued that service flexibility for an orbital transportation network can be defined as the combination of three types of flexibilities, which play out in different time frames: Mix flexibility (long-term), Volume flexibility (mid-term), and emergency service flexibility (short term). Using these definitions, different architectures for an orbital transportation network were evaluated on the basis of their flexibility, value, and performance metrics.

AB  - This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific arc-elasticities. In contrast with the usual methodologies, the present methodology is not based on a statistical analysis of disaggregate data on actual modal choices and transport tariffs. This is a particularly useful feature since such data are mostly not available for freight transports in Europe. Furthermore, it fully takes into account the detailed characteristics of the network, all available routes and combinations of modes, as well as the specific localisation of activities within the network. Its estimates are compared with previously published estimates, and, in particular, with Abdelwahab's results published (1998) in this journal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  -  A framework is presented which may be used to analyze and evaluate intermodal networks. An intermodal network may be defined as an integrated transportation system consisting of two or more modes. Modes on intermodal networks are connected through facilities which allow travelers and/or freight to transfer from one mode to another during a trip from an origin to a destination. Network equilibrium models may be used in the transportation planning field to make predictions regarding future network activity in terms of traffic volumes and travel costs, to evaluate alternative policies and to aid the decision making process in terms of future transportation plans. To expedite and facilitate the effort of detailed intermodal network representation and analysis, a network equilibrium model is interfaced with a geographic information system (GIS). This interface takes advantage of new technologies and sources of information on the physical components of the network. It allows the user to store the results of the proposed models in a GIS environment and display them in a spatial data format.

We present an O(nm2 + m3 + nm log n) algorithm to compute the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane, where n is the number of given sites and m is the complexity of the given transportation network. Moreover, in the case that the roads in a transportation network have only a constant number of directions and speeds, we propose two algorithms; one needs O(nm + m2 + n log n) time with O(m(n + m)) space and the other O(nm log n + m2 log m) time with O(n + m) space. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Building a Smart Low-carbon City is an energy strategy for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network (CIEN), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. CIEN starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). CIEN could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As CIEN is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the CIEN adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - Having not considered such aspects as spatial distribution features of transportation networks and resident areas, the spatial influence of outside transportation modes on the features within the research regions as well as the different transit capacity of different transportation ways, the conventional measuring methods based on path analysis and network analysis are deficient to the description of regional transportation situation. With the employment and optimization of the connectivity and accessibility of the network nodes to evaluate transportation network, this study successfully breaks through the limitation of the border of investigative area and, different transportation modes can also be taken into account. Based on the gradually increased correlation coefficient between the connectivity change, which is a gradually increased process from direct connections to indirect multi-steps connections, and the development of regional economy, this paper proposes economy-network diameter index (ENDI), which is employed to evaluate the development of network and the contribution to regional economy of Gansu Province, china with the data of 2002 transportation network and the economic statistics in the Statistical Yearbook. By above methods, this empirical study comes to the following conclusions: 1) interregional transportation contributes more to the development of regional economic than that of the adjoining transportation; and 2) these indices can be used to designate spatial interactional scopes of regional economy, and accordingly to provide powerful and scientific supports for the planning of regional transportation and economy; and 3) the accessibility figure of network nodes shows that transportation of Gansu Province takes on a phenomenon of high cluster and spatial autocorrelation; and 4) ENDI can also be used to create spatial weight matrix of spatial progress. As calculation of these indices is laborious, several efficient computational methods are developed. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - A two-layer transportation network design model with three
objectives is introduced. The objectives are: the minimization of the
primary path length (or traveling time) from a predetermined starting
node to a predetermined terminus node; the minimization of the total
distance traversed by the demand to reach a node on the primary path;
and the minimization of the total network construction cost. The problem
is initially formulated as an integer linear programming model. A
combinatoric solution which would be suitable for small networks because
of the large size of the subtour breaking constraints is presented. The
method produces efficient solutions according to the objectives
mentioned above. The criteria of alternate transportation facilities,
environmental concerns, and socio-economic structure are included for
these efficient solutions. By using Zeleny's ideal point approach the
best compromise solution is then selected. The results of a numerical
example are also given. Some potential applications of the model include
the planning of a new highway or rapid transportation system and the
design of an energy distribution system

AB  - The goals of this paper are to present criteria, that allow to a priori quantify the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size and to check how these criteria correspond to analytic results available for infinite uncorrelated networks. As a case study, we consider public transportation networks (PTN) of several major cities of the world. To analyze their resilience against attacks, either the network nodes or edges are removed in specific sequences (attack scenarios). During each scenario the size S(c) of the largest remaining network component is observed as function of the removed share c of nodes or edges. To quantify the PTN stability with respect to different attack scenarios we use the area below the curve described by S(c) for c ∈ [0, 1] recently introduced (Schneider, C. M. et al. [PNAS 108 (2011) 3838]) as a numerical measure of network robustness. This measure captures the network reaction over the whole attack sequence. We present results of the analysis of PTN stability against node and link-targeted attacks.

AB  - In connection with the network realization problem the main questions of the algorithm are which edges to choose and what is the budget consequence of that. These problems can be solved by exact optimization methods, but in this case the number of computational steps (additions and comparisons) is an exponential function of the number of nodes. For this reason usually heuristic methods are chosen for solving these problems. Some special problems can be formulated as maximal flow problems. To get the solution we use only maximal flow and shortest route algorithms. Thus we decrease the number of computations, but the size of the network will grow. In this paper, we describe this algorithm to solve the network realization problem. Then we give a transportation network realization problem and show how to solve this problem by the some algorithms.

AB  - The problem of Network Aggregation is defined as the simplification of the number of nodes and links in a transportation network. The objective of a network aggregation technique is to reproduce the level-of-service attributes (such as travel time) between any two points using a spider network as a proxy for the detailed. The aggregation procedure categorizes links into functional groups such as access, egress, line-haul, bypass and intra zonal circulation—which is a convenient classification in terms of transportation analysis. The technique presented here has several distinguishing advantages. First, certain invariance properties are maintained—for example the total trip miles of travel is the same whether measured in the aggregate or detailed networks. Second, the method is systematic, rather than judgemental, which means the inaccuracies introduced as a result of network aggregation can be measured in a scientific way.

AB  -  ABSTRACT The transportation sector consumes 70% of the petroleum that the U.S. uses for fuel, which leads one to study transportation to identify significant opportunities to save energy. Every 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas costs the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) 8 million per year for their 200,000-vehicle fleet. To reduce American dependence on fossil fuels, the carbon footprint left by vehicular fleets should be evaluated. This article reports on the current state of fuel efficiency and fleet efficiency in the U.S., including government, municipal, and large commercial sectors. It also discusses opportunities in behavior modification to improve fleet efficiency. Case studies are presented showing evidence of best practices currently implemented. By studying transportation fleets and educating fleet managers about viable alternatives to improve fleet efficiency, we can save significant amounts of fuel and reduce our carbon footprint. This analysis demonstrates that transportation efficiency is economically feasible for a wide variety of public and private entities and is beneficial to the environment.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It is explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point problem—in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user equilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost functions may not be symmetric—possesses a unique solution with mild conditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the stochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed equilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit functions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which can characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to stochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization problem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously differentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the unified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution method, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network optimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and algorithm.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer service goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling efforts and mathematical programming developments for network design. A new classification of service network design problems and formulations is also introduced.

AB  - Some of the actions taken during Minnesota's implementation of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) are summarized. The focus is on the development of area transportation partnerships (ATPs). The establishment of ATPs was a central tenet in the development of the first state transportation improvement program (STIP). This transportation investment process is but one model for the implementation of ISTEA and the development of a STIP. Minnesota introduced the concept of ATP as a substate, multicounty geographic basis for transportation investment decisions. The partnerships depend on cooperation between all modes and state and local transportation interests. ATPs consist of a combination of local elected officials, local transportation planning representatives, and state transportation officials. These officials work, where possible, through existing organizations, such as the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) districts, metropolitan planning organizations, and regional development organizations. The boundaries selected for the partnerships are based on the Mn/DOT state-aid districts, which respect county lines. The ATPs are responsible for integrating the priorities for highway and transit capital activities using federal aid for highways into a draft areawide transportation improvement program (ATIP). Draft ATIPs include a prioritized list of projects to aid in solving transportation problems and implementing the long-range objectives for the area. Each ATP is responsible for submitting an ATIP to Mn/DOT. Mn/DOT evaluates each ATIP for consistency, determines the appropriate funding level, and consolidates them into the STIP.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - With recent development in freight transportation industry, its network structure has become more complicated, as many decision-makers competing for profits with each other are involved. While most recent research in this area is focused on the perfectly competitive market and the prices are given as a constant tariff rate, little attention has been paid to the system optimization problem in the absence of regulatory authority. In this paper, we investigate the competitive equilibrium in an oligopolistic market on a freight network. A partially non-cooperative game among shippers, carriers and infrastructure companies (IC) is examined. All three kinds of players act as profit maximizing agents, except that the carriers and ICs are assumed to behave cooperatively in their own coalitions. We consider the vertically efficient nonlinear tariff schedules which are commonly used in the transportation industry. By introducing a three-stage game-theoretic model, we show that the equilibrium flows can also maximize total system profits if the IC and the carrier both use vertically efficient nonlinear pricing schedules. The division of the surplus associated with each shipment is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. We provide a few examples under different situations to show the existence of the resulting equilibrium. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - In this paper, the controllability and H∞ control method of urban transportation network are considered. Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - It is very important to study the distribution of transportation network based on fractal characteristics. In this paper, we calculate the Length-radius dimension of transportation network of Tianjin city with the help of the software Mathematica, whose results mean that the transportation network of the city has fractal characteristics. The value of length-radius dimension is 1.6403, which shows that the transportation network of the city is close to maturity. The box dimension of different districts of the main city has also been calculated at the scale of 100 to 600 m in this research and the results show that the value is between 1.5027 and 1.6312. It can be concluded that Heping district is the region with the biggest density, most complex structure, best connectivity and most mature function of transportation network in the whole city. According to the study, we obtained that the combination of length-radius dimensions and box dimensions enables the comprehensive analysis of spatial pattern characteristics of density, structure, connectivity and function of transportation network.

AB  - The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) may be the most powerful of all environmental laws affecting transportation. They are intended to significantly affect transportation decision-making, not only to achieve air quality goals but also to affect broader environmental goals related to land use, travel mode choice, and reductions in vehicle miles traveled. The CAAA require greater integration of transportation and air quality planning, and assign a greater responsibility to transportation plans and programs for reducing mobile source emissions. By expanding the requirements for determining the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects with State Implementation Plans for air quality, and by expanding the use of highway funding sanctions to enforce those requirements, the CAAA ensure a continuing linkage between transportation and environmental goals. While the CAAA give transportation and air quality decision-makers the mandate to better coordinate their respective planning processes, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 offers the tools to help carry out that mandate. Consequently, this paper summa- rizes the transportation and air quality provisions of both of these Acts and their relationships.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

AB  - Infrastructure resiliency, particularly related to transportation networks, is essential to any society, especially when considering natural (and man-made) disasters. Recent events around the globe, including Hurricane Katrina, as well as significant seismic events in Haiti, Chile and Japan, have increased the awareness and importance of this fact. Transportation systems are key to response and recovery. They must be able to withstand stress, maintaining baseline service levels, and be stout in physical design and operational concept in order to provide restoration to the system, thus preventing a destructive event from becoming the catalyst for a degenerative epoch. Analyzing the resiliency of a transportation network will aid decision-makers in identifying specific weaknesses within the network, thus allowing the proper prioritization of investments and improvement projects. This paper expands on previous research in quantifying network resiliency. Through the proposed methodology, properly understanding and applying network resiliency may preclude many of the devastating effects caused by destabilizing events, thus preserving quality of life and economic stability.

In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions.

The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling e orts and mathematical programming developments for network design.

Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Complex networks provide a suitable framework to characterize air traffic. Previous works described the world air-transport network as a graph where direct flights are edges and commercial airports are vertices. In this work, we focus instead on the properties of flight delays in the US air- transportation network. We analyze flight performance data in 2010 and study the topological structure of the network as well as the aircraft rotation. The properties of flight delays, including the distribution of total delays, the dependence on the day of the week and the hour-by-hour evolution within each day, are characterized with special attention to flights accumulating delays longer than 12 hours. We find that the distributions are robust to changes in takeoff or landing operations, different moments of the year, or even different airports in the contiguous states. However, airports in remote areas (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico) can show peculiar distributions biased toward long delays. Additionally, we show that long-delayed flights have an important dependence on the destination airport. Keywords

In this paper, we design an optimizing routing protocol ORE for enhancing energy efficiency with network coding in wireless ad hoc networks based on PEER protocol proposed in [I]. We incorporate the path accumulating characteristic and network coding technique to improve PEER protocol with the aim of achieving energy efficiency as much as possible. The results of simulation in both static scenarios and mobile scenarios show that ORE achieves better performance than the existing protocols.

AB  - In combination, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) are innovative and aggressive efforts to move US cities toward integrated transportation and air quality planning. Under these complementary laws, air quality has become a major national transportation goal. In areas with serious air pollution, air quality will be a major consideration in determining the future shape of urban transportation. This paper considers how the CAAA and ISTEA combine to provide an innovative national policy approach of interest to countries seeking to encourage sustainable development in urban centers. The CAAA mandates measurable and enforceable air quality targets. Nation-wide standards are set for acceptable levels of carbon monoxide, ground level ozone, and small particulates. ISTEA includes directions for transportation planners and decision-makers to follow to reach air quality and other goals - transportation planning must emphasize system effi- ciency, and for cities with severe air pollution, transportation projects are expected to contribute to cleaner air. Each urban area has flexibility in how it applies this framework to reflect its priorities and solve its problems. Strict federal sanctions provide incentives for compliance with both laws. Enactment of these laws has produced a period of transition and uncertainty as well as of challenge and opportunity for planners and elected officials. The next several years, the US will provide one national laboratory and over 100 different urban laboratories for innovative approaches to integrate transportation and environmental policies to resolve major urban problems.

The system can be used to develop libraries to deal with emergencies and unplanned events, train response personnel and traffic management center operators, provide decision support and assistance for the evacuation of residents from affected areas, and ensure unhindered access to first responders. A variety of practical issues relevant to evacuation modeling are discussed, and the modeling framework is demonstrated by using the Boston, Massachusetts, network as an example. DynaMIT, a state-of-the-art DTA model, is used in the case study to illustrate how the benefits of network management strategies might be ascertained. The paper concludes with future directions, including the integration of simulation modeling as a real-time tool for the management of evolving evacuations.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer sen ice goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling efforts and mathematical programming developments for network design. A new classification of service network design problems and formulations is also introduced, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - Based on long-term transportation network design decisions and potential parameter variations, it is important that demand uncertainty is considered in transportation modeling. In this paper, we present a novel robustness measure that combines the two objectives by minimizing the expected travel time while bounding the relative regret in each scenario facing uncertain origin-destination demand (OD demand). The concept of ??-robust solution is introduced into the transportation network design problem. We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

Assuming that the system can access statistical information of the aggregated traffic demands between source-destination pairs or zones in the transportation network, traffic congestion can be reduced by using the total travel time of the system as a measure in a traffic assignment model. This paper focuses on a traffic or route assignment problem that incorporates stochastic traffic demand, which can be solved with a Genetic Algorithm.

AB  - Compact city development has, over the last 20 years or so, emerged as the preferred response to the goal of sustainable development. As such, it is pertinent to examine planning practices to see whether the traditional economic bias in planning is now balanced by aims and practices in support of environmental and social sustainability. In this light the social, environmental, and economic goals linked to densification and mixed use development will be the main focus of this article. In addition, the article assesses whether distinct institutional practices support the balancing of these goals. The empirical basis is formed by urban plans in four Scandinavian cities in combination with qualitative interview data. The article concludes that on a discursive level, social, environmental and economic goals are represented in compact city strategies. Institutionalised practices, however, show that economic goals remain at the core of planning. Environmental and social aims still play second fiddle, but new measures are in development that may gradually strengthen their influence over urban development practices.

AB  - Network location models have been used extensively for siting public and private facilities. In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions. We conclude by identifying promising research directions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new and redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is concerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway) network users. This paper presents a bi-level optimization model—in which the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first time— for solving the public transportation network redesign problem (PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total cost, includ- ing user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost, for the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource- and policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user self-routing optimiza- tion problem in which all transit users try to find the transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number of transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic algorithm–based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP bi-level optimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical results are described. Future research directions are also given.

AB  - Current trends in public transportation have led to an increased interest in smart ticketing systems. Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

Since various kinds of events\nincluding floods, heavy\n\nsnowfall, storms and wildfires can cause such spatially spread degradations,\nthe analysis method is\n\nan important complement to the existing studies of single link failures.\nThe methodology involves\n\ncovering the study area with grids of uniformly shaped and sized cells,\nwhere each cell represents\n\nthe extent of an event disrupting any intersecting links. We apply\nthe approach to the Swedish\n\nroad network using travel demand and network data from the Swedish\ntransport modeling system\n\nSampers. Among other things, the study shows that the impacts of area-covering\ndisruptions are\n\nlargely determined by the level of internal, outbound and inbound\ntravel demand of the affected\n\narea itself. This is unlike single link failures, where the link flow\nand the redundancy in the\n\nsurrounding network determine the impacts. As a result, the vulnerability\nto spatially spread\n\nevents shows a markedly different geographical distribution.

AB  - Europe faces major challenges when it comes to formulating its transportation policy. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are considered a key tool to create the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that Europe needs. In freight transportation, ICT is seen as playing a crucial role in providing efficiency in freight transportation operation and in integrating it within the overall ITS that are now being put in place in Europe. The issues and priorities for freight transportation integration with the European ITS are presented, with concentration (as one such priority) on the issue of linking freight transportation management systems with the advanced traffic-management systems of the European ITS. Also covered are the results so far of the thematic network THEMIS, which concentrates on the relation between freight transportation and ITS. A thematic network is a special type of research project, financed by the European Union's Directorate General of Transport and Energy in order to review and synthesize the results of research in a specific field, in this case freight transportation. The efforts made at the European level toward the formulation of a common, ITS-based freight transportation systems architecture are also reviewed. In this respect, there is a report on work done within project THEMIS.
