AB  - The ever increasing negative impact of global warming has reminded all\nof us in transportation professionals the importance of low carbon\nemission transportation system design, planning, and practices. With\nurbanization accelerating in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and other parts of\nthe world, building a sustainable multi-modal transportation network to\naccommodate the residents' transportation needs and cut down greenhouse\ngas emissions in cities around the world has become a very important\nchallenge. The purpose of this paper is to showcase the successful\nstories of cities who are meeting this challenge head on by building\nsustainable multi-modal transportation network. Six major cities in\nthree continents that the authors personally visited will be showcased\nin this paper. From Europe, we have Paris, France and London, England.\nFrom Asia, we have Hong Kong and Tokyo, Japan. From America, we have New\nYork City and San Francisco. Lessons learned from these six cities were\nsummarized and presented in this paper. Hong Kong comes out on top and\nis recognized as the most sustainable multi-modal transportation network\ndesign. It is believed that success can be duplicated if the process is\nclearly documented and benefits truly understood by all transportation\nprofessionals.

AB  - In highly competitive environments, such as retail markets, characterized by a growing heterogeneity of demand and the proliferation of new retail formats, cross-shopping behavior between stores and formats is becoming increasingly common. This process makes customer loyalty a key strategic challenge for retailers that want to consolidate their position within the market. To contribute to the analysis and comprehension of this reality, the authors propose and assess different objective indicators of store loyalty, store format loyalty, and intra-format store loyalty based on budget allocation. Specifically, they analyze the role of retail format in observable loyalty patterns in a market. Through an empirical analysis of grocery purchase patterns of a sample of 580 Spanish households, the authors find that diverse objective loyalty indicators based on budget allocations provide very similar information from a practical point of view. They also find that consumers' regular use of various formats (specifically, supermarkets, hypermarkets, and discount stores) for their purchases explain observed disloyalty better than does purchasing in several stores within these formats. The observed patterns reveal that retail formats define differentiated store profiles that relate to the benefits sought in different purchase situations. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the ground work necessary to study the evolving air transportation industry. A survey of related models based on a system-of-systems perspective results in a methodology formulated to address overlooked areas such as market coordination and competition. An agent-based modeling approach underpins the integration of the demand-side (consumers) and supply-side (service providers) entities to effectively capture the dynamic interactions between these stakeholders within the National Transportation System. Machine Learning techniques are adopted to model the competitive sentience of air service providers in making decisions that affect consumers' travel demand over time and vice versa. An interim model is developed employing this methodology on a four-node, inter-city transportation network, and has shown promising results toward further development efforts.

AB  - Even though an agency is performing well, the public may perceive its performance as poor. This perception is due to a lack of relevant information or an imbalance between what an agency knows about its performance versus what the public knows about agency management and results. This is also known as information asymmetry. This paper shows that information asymmetry and the resulting lack of support for agency funding can be corrected using performance management and measurement and effective, ethical communication. This requires that information be presented in a manner that is timely, clear, sincere, truthful, and legitimate. The Washington State Department of Transportation's (DOT) response to a severe funding and accountability crisis is presented. Although the Washington State DOT was well regarded by its national peers as a high-performance agency, public, media, and legislative sentiment questioned its credibility and performance. The Washington State DOT responded to this crisis by instituting a program of regular, timely performance measurement and reporting designed to effectively communicate results to the legislature and the public and thus make the case for increased funding. During a period of approximately 3 years, polling data changed from nearly 75% of voters saying they did not trust the agency to spend tax dollars wisely, to just 12%. At the same time, two transportation tax increases (2003 and 2005) were approved and an initiative to repeal the 2005 tax increase was rejected by voters. The Washington State DOT case suggests that effective performance management and reporting, combined with strong leadership, is important for increasing agency credibility and securing funding.

AB  - Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the cognitive control of response related action. A frontocentral negative ERP-component, the N2, which probably originates from the ACC, is usually enhanced in conflict-trials that demand an unexpected response. We here used stepped adjustment of response expectation in a response-cueing task, and measured how the N2 varied with global and local cue validity. Results showed that, irrespective of the current cue validity, response times, error rates, and the frontocentral components P2, N2 and P3 increased in unexpected trials. Nevertheless, a N2 was also seen in expected trials, and its latency correlated positively with reaction times, indicating that this potential does not express response conflict only. In line with roles suggested for the ACC, we here propose that the N2 is related to the process of response selection which influences subsequent processing stages reflected in the P3. Unexpected revisions of response programs enhance and delay the N2.

AB  - Machines with sinister minds of their own have been standard fare in popular sci-fi chillers like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Stephen King's bestseller Christine. But the fiction behind these devices is rapidly becoming fact, and Ada — a room-sized artificial intelligence system on show at the 2002 Swiss National Exhibition in Neuchâtel until Oct. 20 — is living proof. Developed at the Institute for Neuroinformatics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Ada is a mirror-clad room outfitted with its own electronic eyes and ears that is capable of interacting and communicating with visitors. A matrix of ceiling cameras monitors guests as they move about inside the room, while directional microphones pick up sounds ranging from whispers to shouts. Even the floor is equipped with pressure sensors that can track a person's progress through the room. Should Ada want to communicate with visitors, it can do so through complex light and sound projections. If it's feeling talkative, for example, Ada can generate music that corresponds to its state of mind: a tinkling sound, for instance, might indicate amusement. Alternatively, the machine can express itself via stunning light shows that may suggest confusion or disappointment through different hues and patterns. Or, if Ada wants to direct visitors' attention to something in particular, it can illuminate colored lamps in the floor that outline the route they should take to find the desired object. Ada, named after 19th century British programming pioneer Ada Lovelace, performs all these feats thanks to neural network technology, layers of computer circuits that work in ways analogous to the human brain. If its intelligent space architecture proves a success, Ada may help pave the way for the acceptance and development of commercially constructed "smart" rooms and buildings that can dynamically adapt themselves to the needs of their inhabitants.

AB  - This article contains the argument that the human ability to travel mentally in time constitutes a discontinuity between ourselves and other animals. Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. It is not an isolated module, but depends on the sophistication of other cognitive capacities, including self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception-knowledge relationship, and the ability to dissociate imagined mental states from one's present mental state. These capacities are also important aspects of so-called theory of mind, and they appear to mature in children at around age 4. Furthermore, mental time travel is generative, involving the combination and recombination of familiar elements, and in this respect may have been a precursor to language. Current evidence, although indirect or based on anecdote rather than on systematic study, suggests that nonhuman animals, including the great apes, are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. In contrast, mental time travel by humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning. Past and future events loom large in much of human thinking, giving rise to cultural, religious, and scientific concepts about origins, destiny, and time itself.

AB  - Under the United States federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, states must implement transportation system management (TSM) tactics in urban areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of using TSM tactics to improve air quality. Based on this assessment, the authors conclude that TSM measures should be effective in eliminating localized carbon monoxide problems, but that such measures are not likely to contribute significantly toward reducing regional oxidant levels. In addition, because most individual TSM tactics can have only marginal impacts on regional motor vehicle emissions, coordinating the planning and implemen- tation of a portfolio of TSM measures will be an essential element of an effective TSM program for improving air quality.

AB  - The challenge of jointly addressing transportation and air quality concerns has been the subject of research for some time, but it reached its apex after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Since that time, the legislative and regulatory context that prompted extensive research has been in continual flux, leading to ever-new areas even as the original agenda set in the early 1990s has yet to be completed. Critical relationships between transportation behavior and air quality impacts have yet to be clarified, and more data and better analytical tools will be necessary before greater understanding is achieved. The advent of new strategies related to telecommuting, e-commerce, vehicle insurance, car sharing, and "sustainability" poses serious questions for the research community. Concurrently, new challenges abound spawned from current and future developments. New air quality standards have redefined the meaning of "clean" air. Air toxics loom as the next focus area from the 1990 amendments. New vehicle and fuel standards are being adopted. Greenhouse gases and global warming pose particular challenges for transportation, but radically new vehicle-fuel systems for cars, trucks, and buses show promise that the transportation community can again rise to meet these challenges. Knowing where the greatest air quality problems exist and how best to address them is the stuff of cutting-edge research, which will pose a challenge into the next decade. It is an exciting time to be in transportation and air quality.

AB  - Darwin was struck by the many similarities between humans and other primates and believed that these similarities were the product of common ancestry. He would be even more impressed by the similarities if he had known what we have learned about primates over the last 50 years. Genetic kinship has emerged as the primary organizing force in the evolution of primate social organization and the patterning of social behaviour in non-human primate groups. There are pronounced nepotistic biases across the primate order, from tiny grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus) that forage alone at night but cluster with relatives to sleep during the day, to cooperatively breeding marmosets that rely on closely related helpers to rear their young, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) females who acquire their mother's rank and form strict matrilineal dominance hierarchies, male howler monkeys that help their sons maintain access to groups of females and male chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) that form lasting relationships with their brothers. As more evidence of nepotism has accumulated, important questions about the evolutionary processes underlying these kin biases have been raised. Although kin selection predicts that altruism will be biased in favour of relatives, it is difficult to assess whether primates actually conform to predictions derived from Hamilton's rule: br > c. In addition, other mechanisms, including contingent reciprocity and mutualism, could contribute to the nepotistic biases observed in non-human primate groups. There are good reasons to suspect that these processes may complement the effects of kin selection and amplify the extent of nepotistic biases in behaviour.

AB  - Behavioral rating scales for dyskinesia in the non-human primate are frequently used to assess the efficacy of new treatments and to provide a clinical correlative with neurochemical and neuropathological changes. Although a large variety of different scales have been used in non-human primate studies, there is no single standardized scale, and none have been evaluated for reliability and validity. We are reporting a new global non-human primate dyskinesia rating scale (GPDRS) for the squirrel monkey, developed in the context of an independent study of dyskinesia. In this report we demonstrate the reliability and validity of this scale. The GPDRS is a single-item scale with well-defined points and brevity allowing for rapid and easy application for assessing the overall degree of dyskinesia. In this study, seven MPTP-lesioned and four non-lesioned (control) non-human primates were videotaped following treatment with either levodopa or water. To test inter- and intra-rater reliability, three examiners rated the videotape independently at two different time points and these assessments were compared. The validity of the scale was tested in two phases. First, examiners rated the videotape using the GPDRS and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), a scale commonly used to rate dyskinesia in the non-human primate, and the ratings from each scale were compared. Second, validity was tested in the context of an independent dyskinesia study, in which the scale was used to distinguish between two treatment groups. The GPDRS was shown to have high inter- and intra-rater reliability and to be valid for the assessment of dyskinesia in the squirrel monkey. In this report we also demonstrate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the AIMS.

AB  - Aiming at forming dynamic optimal integrated marketing policies, we build a budget allocation model considering both current effects and sustained ones. The model includes multiple time periods and multiple marketing tools which interact through a common resource pool as well as through delayed cross influences on each other's sales, reflecting the nature of "integrated marketing" and its dynamics. In our study, marginal analysis is used to illuminate the structure of optimal policy. We derive some analytical results which have managerial implications and give strong supports to empirical actions in marketing. Our results are consistent with those in some resource allocations problems, but different from those in the others. We illustrate the application of our model by demonstrating a case of a beauty salon in Xi'an, China. We show how to optimally allocate budgets between different sales promotion components so as to maximize the profits of beauty product and service companies.

AB  - Simulation plays a vital role in analyzing discrete-event systems, particularly in comparing alternative system designs with a view to optimizing system performance. Using simulation to analyze complex systems, however, can be both prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Effective algorithms to allocate intelligently a computing budget for discrete-event simulation experiments are presented in this paper. These algorithms dynamically determine the simulation lengths for all simulation experiments and thus significantly improve simulation efficiency under the constraint of a given computing budget. Numerical illustrations are provided and the algorithms are compared with traditional two-stage ranking-and-selection procedures through numerical experiments. Although the proposed approach is based on heuristics, the numerical results indicate that it is much more efficient than the compared procedures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background/Aims: An adequate model to study liver regeneration in humans is presently unavailable. We explored the feasibility of studying liver regeneration in a genetically similar species to man, the non-human primate Rhesus macaque. Methods: Five animals were studied; two underwent 60% hepatectomy, one underwent 30% hepatectomy, and cholecystectomy alone was performed on two animals. Laparoscopic-guided or open liver biopsies were performed on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 following all surgeries. Liver regeneration was evaluated by measuring Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and mitotic index, calculating changes in the surface area of the liver remnant and assessing intrahepatic production of cytokines. Results: Significant liver regeneration was induced in the animals that underwent 60% hepatectomy, peaking between days 21-30 postoperatively. Regeneration was minimal in all other animals studied. Cytokine production followed a similar pattern. Maximal liver regeneration correlated with restoration of surface area in the liver remnant. Conclusions: Sixty percent hepatectomy in a non-human primate model induced significant liver regeneration, maximizing 21-30 days following partial hepatectomy, suggesting a significant interspecies difference when compared to a rodent hepatectomy model. A partial hepatectomy model in Rhesus macaques may allow further characterization of liver regeneration in a species closer to humans. © 2002 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB  - Infection of non-human primate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in vitro with primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates is extremely inefficient and often unattainable. The mechanism of resistance to infection by primary HIV-1 isolates in chimpanzee and baboon PBMCs is unknown. In this study, two HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, were sequenced from chimpanzee and baboon PBMCs to determine if any sequence variations or mutations in these genes could be responsible for resistance to HIV infection. Primers were designed from the human coreceptor sequences and were able to amplify the CCR5 and CXCR4 genes from these non-human primate cells. No 32 base pair deletion (??32) mutations were found in any of the non-human primate samples tested. CXCR4 sequence analysis showed chimpanzee and baboon share 99.7 and 98% nucleotide sequence homology and 100 and 98.9% amino acid sequence homology, respectively, compared to the human sequence. CCR5 sequence analysis demonstrated that chimpanzee and baboon share 99.6 and 98% nucleotide homology and 100 and 98% amino acid homology, respectively, with the human sequence. These data indicate that no variations in these coreceptor gene sequences exist that can explain the lack of susceptibility to infection with primary HIV-1 isolates in non-human primate PBMCs.

In the special case where time travel is limited to a single object returning to the past and interacting with itself, consistency constraints can be avoided if the dynamics is continuous and the object's state space satisfies a certain topological requirement: that all null‐homotopic mappings from the state‐space to itself have some fixed point. Where consistency constraints do exist, no new physics is needed to enforce them. One needs only to accept certain global topological constraints as laws, something that is reasonable in any case.

paper. Traffic intersections are the primitive elements of a
transportation network and are characterized as event-driven and
asynchronous systems. Petri networks have been utilized to model these
discrete event systems; further analysis of their structure can reveal
information relevant to the concurrency, parallelism, synchronization,
and deadlock avoidance issues. The Petri-net model of a generic traffic
junction is presented, with its deadlock avoidance property proven.
These modular networks are effective in synchronizing their components
and can be used for modeling of an asynchronous large-scale
transportation system. The derived model is suitable for simulations on
a multiprocessor computer since its program execution safety is secured.

AB  - On 910 May 2005, over 200 people met at the Royal Society in London to discuss sexual conflict. Papers by 12 of the speakers are presented in this volume. In this introductory note we briefly discuss whether we have, or in fact need, a universal definition of sexual conflict. We briefly summarize what for us were the main messages emerging from the meeting in relation to where the field of sexual conflict currently stands, before finally attempting to distil some of the important unanswered questions for the future. Our motivation for organizing the meeting was that it seemed to us that in the last ten years or so, there has been a dramatic shift in the prevailing view of matings as being essentially a good thing for both participants, to one in which they are regarded as bad for females. This change has been driven primarily by some very elegant empirical work, which has generated some passionate advocacy (and some equally passionate resistance) for the importance of conflict. However, whether evolutionary biologists were mistakenly viewing male female interactions as more benign than they actually are, or whether there is now a tendency to overemphasize the importance of conflicts of interest, is a major question that warrants consideration. This discussion meeting provided an opportunity to explore the state of the art and whether sexual conflict is indeed a new paradigm. This was made possible by the hard work of the participants, whom we would like to take this opportunity to thank.

AB  - On 910 May 2005, over 200 people met at the Royal Society in London to discuss sexual conflict. Papers by 12 of the speakers are presented in this volume. In this introductory note we briefly discuss whether we have, or in fact need, a universal definition of sexual conflict. We briefly summarize what for us were the main messages emerging from the meeting in relation to where the field of sexual conflict currently stands, before finally attempting to distil some of the important unanswered questions for the future. Our motivation for organizing the meeting was that it seemed to us that in the last ten years or so, there has been a dramatic shift in the prevailing view of matings as being essentially a good thing for both participants, to one in which they are regarded as bad for females. This change has been driven primarily by some very elegant empirical work, which has generated some passionate advocacy (and some equally passionate resistance) for the importance of conflict. However, whether evolutionary biologists were mistakenly viewing male female interactions as more benign than they actually are, or whether there is now a tendency to overemphasize the importance of conflicts of interest, is a major question that warrants consideration. This discussion meeting provided an opportunity to explore the state of the art and whether sexual conflict is indeed a new paradigm. This was made possible by the hard work of the participants, whom we would like to take this opportunity to thank.

AB  - Attackers' private information is one of the main issues in defensive resource allocation games in homeland security. The outcome of a defense resource allocation decision critically depends on the accuracy of estimations about the attacker's attributes. However, terrorists' goals may be unknown to the defender, necessitating robust decisions by the defender. This article develops a robust-optimization game-theoretical model for identifying optimal defense resource allocation strategies for a rational defender facing a strategic attacker while the attacker's valuation of targets, being the most critical attribute of the attacker, is unknown but belongs to bounded distribution-free intervals. To our best knowledge, no previous research has applied robust optimization in homeland security resource allocation when uncertainty is defined in bounded distribution-free intervals. The key features of our model include (1) modeling uncertainty in attackers' attributes, where uncertainty is characterized by bounded intervals; (2) finding the robust-optimization equilibrium for the defender using concepts dealing with budget of uncertainty and price of robustness; and (3) applying the proposed model to real data.

AB  - In this article the need for permanent mechanisms of conflict resolution, i.e. mechanisms that can decide who is the winner and who is the loser, and distribute sanctions, punishments and rewards among the parties and terminate a conflict, is pointed out. Twelve mechanisms of this kind are discussed in the article: mechanisms where neither party to the conflict participates (chance mechanisms, oracles), mechanisms where one party participates (ordeals) and mechanisms where both parties participate (regulated warfare, fights, duels, legal duels, verbal duels, debates, mediation/arbitration, court processes and voting). It is pointed out that these mechanisms sometimes function as mechanisms of direct conflict resolution in the sense that the winner in the mechanism also wins in the underlying conflict and that the loser loses both places. Thus, ordeals were used to distribute property. But the mechanisms were also often used in a more indirect or independent way: they focused the attention of the parties to a conflict on something new, they functioned as a safety-valve, and they brought some kind of compensation to the loser. The article then discusses at length fifteen conditions that seem important for the institutionalization of a conflict resolution mechanism. It is pointed out that these conditions probably are complementary to each other in the sense that if some of them are satisfied, then it is less necessary that the others are, but that the mechanism will be more firmly rooted the more conditions are satisfied. Some consequences of this principle are pointed out. Finally, the possibility of institutionalized conflict resolution in the field of international conflict is discussed, and a mechanism based on a combination of world wide television debates between spokesmen of the parties to the conflict, voting by the whole world population, and a set of well-known rules of international behavior is analyzed. The propositions of the article are illustrated by means of scattered reports on the various mechanisms, with a concentration on ordeals, legal duels and common-sense knowledge of court processes.

AB  - Are humans alone in their ability to reminisce about the past and imagine the future? Recent evidence suggests that food-storing birds (scrub jays) have access to information about what they have stored where and when. This has raised the possibility of mental time travel (MTT) in animals and sparked similar research with other species. Here we caution that such data do not provide convincing evidence for MTT. Examination of characteristics of human MTT (e.g. non-verbal declaration, generativity, developmental prerequisites) points to other avenues as to how a case for animal MTT could be made. In light of the current lack of evidence, however, we maintain that MTT is a uniquely human characteristic.

AB  - We study bandwidth allocation at base stations of a wireless network as a non-cooperative game between different wireless users. A user demands bandwidth from the base stations it has access to by submitting bids. Once the bidding process is complete, a base station distributes its bandwidth to the users in proportion to their bids. Users are assumed to be budget constrained and price anticipating, and split their wealth across base stations so as to maximize their individual bandwidths. In this paper, we study the properties of Nash Equilibrium (NE) for this bandwidth allocation game. For the special case where each user can access all base stations, we argue that there exists a unique NE, at which the bandwidth obtained by any user is proportional to its wealth. For a more general scenario where a user may be able to access only a subset of all base stations, we compare the NE of the game to the max-min fair bandwidth allocation. We show that although the NE may not be max-min fair in general, the bandwidth allocation at NE becomes arbitrarily close to max-min fair allocation as the number of users is increased, while keeping the number of base stations fixed.

We present a general modeling framework, based on a network optimization model, which may be used to assist and enhance the tactical and strategic planning process for such a system. The problem is solved by means of an algorithm, described in some detail, based on decomposition and column generation principles. We also present detailed results on the behaviour and performance of the algorithm, as observed during experimentation with a specific rail application.

This is the latest in a series of visionary plans that Metro has used to imagine the future we want for public transportation and then achieve it. Metros last major strategic planning effort resulted in the 2002-2007 Metro Six-Year Development Plan, which was updated in 2004, 2007, and 2009. At the time this earlier plan was written, communities and employment centers were growing around the county, and traffic congestion had become one of the regions foremost problems. The 2002 plan set the stage for Metro to enhance mobility by serving more people throughout King County and by connecting to more destinations.

We formulate this problem under a Bayesian framework and propose two heuristics algorithms, i.e., a gradient-based algorithm and a hybrid GA algorithm to solve this optimization problem. Our results indicate that effective allocation of budget for data collection can greatly reduce the overall data collection effort in comparison with a uniform budget allocation.

AB  - Regional cerebral blood flow, an index of local neuronal activity, was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) during the performance of the classic Stroop color/word task in eight healthy right-handed subjects. In the first condition of this paradigm, subjects name the color of the words presented on a video monitor. All the words are the color names congruent to the color presented (e.g., the noun "red" displayed in red color). In the second condition, subjects also name the color of the words presented on the monitor. However, during these trials all words are color names incongruent to the color presented (e.g., the noun "red" displayed in green color). The difference in brain activity between these two conditions (i.e., incongruent minus congruent) could reveal brain systems involved in the attentionally mediated resolution of the conflict between the habitual response of reading words vs. the task demands of naming the color of the words--i.e., the Stroop interference effect. The most robust responses occurred in the anterior cingulate cortex. Other responses noted were in the left premotor cortex, left postcentral cortex, left putamen, supplementary motor area, right superior temporal gyrus, and bilateral peristriate cortices. These data provide support for the role of the anterior cingulate cortex in attentional processing through the selection and recruitment of processing centers appropriate for task execution. Furthermore, the extensive distributed network of activated regions suggests that the Stroop interference effect cannot be explained simply in terms of stimulus encoding or response interference.

AB  - The effect of the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of 3-PPP [conventional and atypical dopamine (DA)-receptor active agent, respectively] were investigated in a commonly used animal model of anxiety: the Vogel licking-conflict test. Low doses (less than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg SC) of both 3-PPP enantiomers resulted in anti-conflict (= anxiolytic-like) actions in this test. (-)-3-PPP proved to be almost as potent as apomorphine in releasing the punished responding (minimum effective doses; (-)-3-PPP: 0.016, and apomorphine: 0.006 mg/kg SC), whereas (+)-3-PPP was about 10 times less effective than apomorphine. In the higher dose range (greater than or equal to 1.0 mg/kg), both 3-PPP enantiomers instead induced an apparent "pro"-conflict effect; i.e. decreased responding to a level significantly below baseline, thus resulting in a biphasic dose-response curve. Simple alterations in the animals' motivation to drink, in shock threshold or in motor capabilities did not seem to be major explanatory factors either for the anti- or for the "pro"-conflict effects. With regard to the latter, the possibility is discussed of an interaction between the experimental test situation and non conflict-related effects of the drugs, thus interfering with the punished drinking. The findings are interpreted within the concept that low doses of the 3-PPP enantiomers, in particular (-)-3-PPP, may attenuate anxiety-elicited increases in the neurotransmission in certain meso-cortical/limbic DA pathways, i.e. consistent with the previously shown preferentially "limbic" net antidopaminergic profile of action of (-)-3-PPP.

AB  - Current models of autobiographical memory suggest that self-identity guides autobiographical memory retrieval. Further, the capacity to recall the past and imagine one's self in the future (mental time travel) can influence social problem solving. We examined whether manipulating self-identity, through an induction task in which students were led to believe they possessed high or low self-efficacy, impacted episodic specificity and content of retrieved and imagined events, as well as social problem solving. Compared to individuals in the low self efficacy group, individuals in the high self efficacy group generated past and future events with greater (a) specificity, (b) positive words, and (c) self-efficacious statements, and also performed better on social problem solving indices. A lack of episodic detail for future events predicted poorer performance on social problem solving tasks. Strategies that increase perceived self-efficacy may help individuals to selectively construct a past and future that aids in negotiating social problems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to travel mentally through time sets humans apart from many other species, yet little is known about this core cognitive capacity. In particular, what shapes the passage of the mind's journey through time? Guided by the viewpoint that higher cognitive activity can have a sensory-motor grounding, we explored the possibility that mental time travel is influenced by apparent movement through space. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Participants performed a mundane vigilance task, during which they were expected to daydream, while viewing a display that elicited an illusion of self-motion (i.e., vection). Afterwards, the contents of their mind wandering experiences were probed. The results revealed that the direction of apparent motion influenced the temporal focus of mental time travel. While backward vection prompted thinking about the past, forward vection triggered a preponderance of future-oriented thoughts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Consistent with recent evidence that traveling mentally through time entails associated movements in space, the current results demonstrate the converse relationship-apparent movement through space influenced the temporal locus of mental activity. Together, these findings corroborate the viewpoint that mental time travel may be grounded in the embodiment of spatiotemporal information in a bidirectional manner.

AB  - Although non-human primate models have been used previously to investigate the neurobiology of several sensory and cognitive developmental pathologies, they have been employed only sparingly to study the etiology of childhood psychopathologies for which deficits in social behavior and emotion regulation are major symptoms. Previous investigations of both adult human and non-human primates have indicated that primate social behavior and emotion are regulated by a complex neural network, in which the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex play major roles. Therefore, this review will provide information generated from the study of macaque monkeys regarding the timing of normal social and emotional behavior development, the normal pattern of anatomical and functional maturation of the amygdala and orbital frontal cortex, as well as information regarding the neural and behavioral effects of early perturbations of these two neural structures. We will also highlight 'critical periods' of macaque development, during which major refinements in the behavioral repertoire appear to coincide with significant neural maturation of the amygdala and/or orbital frontal cortex. The identification of these 'critical periods' may allow one to better predict the specific behavioral impairments likely to appear after neonatal damage to one or both of these neural areas at different time points during development. This experimental approach may provide a new and important way to inform and stimulate research on childhood psychopathologies, such as autism, schizophrenia and Williams syndrome, in which the development of normal social skills and emotional regulation is severely perturbed. Finally, the promise and limitations inherent to the use of non-human primate models of childhood psychopathology will be discussed.

Special relativity requires world lines of physical objects to be time-like, ie the world line stays within its light cone. But closed loops might still be possible if space-time is suitably distorted. Closed time-like curves - CTCs. Possibility of following such a curve into the past not ruled out by relativity, though any such curve would have limited capacity (in following it one would bump into everyone who has eer traveeled it).

AB  - Non-human primates (NHPs) are used to model human disease owing to their remarkably similar genomes, physiology, and immune systems. Recently, there has been an increased interest in modeling tuberculosis (TB) in NHPs. Macaques are susceptible to infection with different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), producing the full spectrum of disease conditions, including latent infection, chronic progressive infection, and acute TB, depending on the route and dose of infection. Clearly, NHPs are an excellent model of human TB. While the initial aim of the NHP model was to allow preclinical testing of candidate vaccines and drugs, it is now also being used to study pathogenesis and immune correlates of protection. Recent advances in this field are discussed in this review. Key questions such as the effect of hypoxia on the biology of Mtb and the basis of reactivation of latent TB can now be investigated through the use of this model.

AB  - The standard Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model assumes that assimilates of an isomorphic individual are first added to reserve, a fraction ?? of mobilised reserve is allocated to soma (somatic maintenance plus growth of structure), and the rest to maturity maintenance and maturation or reproduction. Food, reserve and structure have constant chemical composition. We here discuss all possible topological alternatives to the standard DEB model, and compare them on the basis of seven properties: the ability to capture weak homeostasis and general empirical growth and reproduction patterns. We selected a reserve dynamics such that reserve mobilisation rate is independent of assimilation, somatic maintenance is proportional to the amount of structure, maturity maintenance to the level of maturity, and assimilation to the surface area. The alternatives only differ from the standard DEB model in topology, but we drop the ??-rule and allow ?? to vary with the amount of structure. For this purpose we introduce the concept 'generalised von Bertalanffy growth rate' and study how it behaves as a function of the ultimate structural length, both intra- and inter-specifically. The 21 derived topological alternatives of the standard DEB are classified into five classes of models, depending on the first allocation event for the assimilation flux. The possibilities of the first allocation event for the assimilation flux are: splitting (??-models), storing (A-models), both maintenance fluxes simultaneously (P-models), somatic maintenance (S-models) or maturity maintenance (J-models). We conclude that the standard DEB model with constant ?? is the only one that passes all our tests successfully. Only assimilation (A) models can naturally accommodate embryo development. The ??-models, which after splitting the fraction 1-?? of assimilates is allocated to maturity maintenance and maturity/reproduction while the fraction ?? of assimilates is first stored in reserve or allocated to somatic maintenance, pass most tests, but have maturation and reproduction directly from food. So, embryos have to do this differently and reproduction is prohibited during starvation in these models. ?? 2011.

AB  - The aim of this study was threefold: first, it was to explore the profiles of student teachers' mental time travel ability; second, it was to examine the relationship between student teachers' mental time travel ability and self-efficacy beliefs; and third, it was to investigate the role of self-efficacy beliefs in relationship between the past and future dimensions of mental time travel ability. Based on the survey method, a total of 260 student teachers participated in the study. Results showed that student teachers' mental time travel ability can well be classified under the headings of high mental time travel ability, medium mental time travel ability, and low mental time travel ability. Results also revealed that student teachers' self-efficacy beliefs vary as a function of their mental time travel ability. More importantly, self-efficacy beliefs played a significant mediating role in relationship between teaching-related past events and teaching-related possible future events. Overall results of the present study suggest that the relationship between mental time travel ability and self-efficacy beliefs makes sense in educational settings. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The coraco-clavicular joint is a true synovial joint that may become painful in some patients after trauma. Among the descriptions of this entity is the assertion that the coraco-clavicular joint is routinely seen in gorillas and gibbons. We undertook to assess the incidence of this variant among gorillas, gibbons, and other non-human primates. All available radiographs of large primates performed at the International Wildlife Conservation Park/Bronx Zoo (IWCP) over the past 10 years were reviewed by a musculoskeletal radiologist (human radiology). All radiographs were taken during the normal clinical care of the non-human primate population of the IWCP and are a part of each animal's clinical record. Eighty-one non-human primate radiographs were suitable for study as they contained the region of interest. The 81 radiographic examinations included 14 different species of non-human primates. The coraco-clavicular joint was seen in 4 out of 9 silver-leaf langur, 2 out of 8 lowland gorilla, and in 1 out of 6 white-handed gibbon. In all non-human primate cases where the coraco-clavicular joint occurred, it was bilateral. In 1 out of 8 mandrill, there were very wide distal clavicular ends that articulated both with the coracoid and with the acromion. The coraco-clavicular joint differs from an ossified coraco-clavicular ligament. The radiographic appearance is characteristic and is found in both humans and some non-human primate species. It may rarely become painful following trauma. When symptomatic in humans, resection of this anomalous articulation is curative.

AB  - A budget allocation approach is presented for estimating price-demand and cross-price relationships experimentally. Budget allocation is useful as an alternative to choice when the mix of competing products demanded over time may not match the choice probabilities at a single time point, as when the products in the mix differ in price and quality. The approach is demonstrated for a potential new entertainment product, on-demand video (VOD). Subjects saw demonstrations of a working prototype of VOD and its features, including price. Subjects judged each VOD feature package in the context of (a) their current budget for video and movie entertainment, and (b) assumed prices for theater movies, premium cable, and video rentals. Subjects allocated a monthly budget across VOD and the other entertainment sources. These data yielded estimates of the price-demand relationship for VOD and the cross-price-demand relationship for the four entertainment options.

AB  - Australia has undergone an intensive period of reform particularly in relation to its port infrastructure. This has led to the deregulation of much of the port and maritime sectors. Privatization and corporatization of government owned businesses, as a result, have been set in place. A decade after reform was introduced, particular problems are emerging relating to regulation. Much of the reformed infrastructure was developed by state governments and deemed to be ?natural monopolies?. These facilities, once privatized, were transformed into privately owned ?natural monopolies?. This has demanded regulation to prevent the abuse of monopoly power and the imposition of monopoly rents. A myriad of regulatory regimes have been created at the federal and state government levels to regulate privatized and corporatized instrumentalities. Evidence is now emerging suggesting that outcomes are in conflict with the objectives of reform and of National Competition Policy, and are constraining the expansion of essential port and creating inefficiencies in export supply chains. This paper discusses the objectives of reform and problems associated with the deregulation of public sector monopolies. It looks at the particular problem of regulating a former government monopoly, once privatized, and transformed into a private sector monopoly. It investigates the impact of regulation on the workings of commercially focused port businesses and on export supply chains.\nAustralia has undergone an intensive period of reform particularly in relation to its port infrastructure.

AB  - The capacity to anticipate future experiences of regret has been hypothesized to explain otherwise irrational aspects of human decision-making, including the certainty effect (Kahneman and Tversky (1979) Econometrica 47:263-291) and the common ratio effect (Allais (1953) Econometrica 21:503-546). The anticipated regret hypothesis predicts that individuals incapable of episodically imagining their personal futures, as has been reported for people with extensive damage to medial temporal lobe structures and resulting deficits in episodic thought, should be immune to these effects. We report that K.C., who has extensive bilateral damage to his hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe structures and nearly complete deficits in his ability to episodically imagine his personal future, nonetheless displays both the certainty and the common ratio effects. These results suggest that the episodic anticipation of future regret does not explain the general human tendency to display the certainty and common ratio effects. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Whether couples have been dating a few months or have been married for many years, conflict is likely an inevitable part of the relationship. According to Canary, Cupach, and Messman (1995), how couples handle conflict informs other areas of their relationship, such as how satisfied they are in their relationship. Thus, when examining other relational variables it is important to understand how individuals approach conflict with their partner. In Study 1, the relationships between three conflict strategies (i.e., compromise, emotional reactivity, interactional reactivity) and other variables such as satisfaction, respect, sexual attitudes, and self-disclosure were assessed. In Study 2, items for a new conflict scale, the Romantic Partner Conflict Scale (RPCS; 39 items), were developed and subjected to a factor analysis. Six factors emerged: Compromise, Domination, Submission, Separation, Avoidance, and Interactional Reactivity. The relationships between these six strategies and respect, commitment, and satisfaction were assessed. The goals of Study 3 were to confirm the factor structure of the RPCS and to relate the six subscales to self-disclosure, sex, commitment, love, satisfaction, and respect. Confirmatory factor analyses tested two, three, five, and six factor models. The six factor model resulted in the best fitting model. Alphas for the subscales ranged from .84 to .96 and the subscales correlated appropriately with the other relational variables. Implications for this new conflict scale, as well as limitations of the studies, are discussed.

AB  - The goal of the project is to ensure long-term survival of the Siberian / Amur tiger and peaceful coexistence of people and tigers in the Russian Far East through timely human-tiger conflicts resolution and outreach activities. For the reported period 62 conflict tiger cases were reported and investigated in Primorsky and Khabarovsky krais. It is twice as many cases as in 2003. This increase can be connected with a more intensified economic development in the region. Logging, both legal and illegal, and harvesting berries, pinecones etc in the forest, represent an anthropogenic pressure on tiger habitat. Forest fires, hunting and poaching also decrease tiger habitat and prey base and make tigers come to human settlements. Four of the cases started at the end of 2003. Two cases were investigated by Khabarovsky Hunting Management Department. In total, 9 tiger death cases were reported in the tiger habitat, 7 of which were investigated by the Inspection Tiger teams (1 in Khabarovsky region (case No. 21 ) and 6 in Primorye (cases Nos. 1, 17, 19, 29, 48) + one tiger was found shot near Lazovsky nature reserve and one emaciated tiger cub was killed in an attack on a man in Khabarovsky region); 3 human casualties (1 man was killed by a tiger in Khabarovsky region (case No. 21), 1 was killed and another one was injured by tigers in Primorye (cases Nos. 17, 19) were registered for the reported period. Despite an increase in conflict tiger cases in 2004, the tiger population seems to be stable. Tiger tracks and visits were reported in Amursky region, to the west of Khabarovsky region, where Amur tigers had been seen in the beginning of the 20th century. One can suppose that tigers started wandering there in search of new habitat. Industrial development in the south of Khabarovsky region and Primorye will speed up in the nearest future. First of all, it is connected with the decision of the Government to start construction of the oil pipeline "Siberia – Pacific Ocean" in 2005; and the pipeline will go through the tiger habitat. The logging companies plan to increase logging in the region. We can suppose that this will lead to an increase in conflict tiger cases. To investigate, solve and prevent human-tiger conflicts in tiger habitat it is necessary to continue and develop this important tiger conservation project. In connection with a two-fold increase in human-tiger conflicts in 2004, investigation of the cases required more funds, that is why the funds ($2,000) presupposed for the information support were used to investigate of the cases.

A gap in the mental time travel literature exists, as paradigms have not explored the affective component of re-experiencing past episodic events; this study explored this sparsely researched area. The present study employed standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) to identify electrophysiological correlates of re-experience affect-laden and non-affective past events, as well as pre-experiencing a future anticipated event. Our results confirm previous research and are also novel in that we illustrate common and distinct electrophysiological correlates of re-experiencing affective episodic events. Furthermore, research from this experiment yields results outlining a pattern of activation in the frontal and temporal regions is correlated with the time frame of past or future events subjects imagined. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The advertising-sales response function is modeled through a flexible form that allows both concave and S-shaped relationships, while sales are related to price through a constant elasticity (Cobb-Douglas) function. The model uses the estimated or input functions to compute the optimal budget allocation for the brands, given an upper bound for the total promotional expenditures and upper- and louder-budget bounds for every brand, using nonlinear optimisation heuristics. Optimal prices for the brands are also computed.

We argue that animal memory for when an event happened must be distinguished from memory for how long ago it happened to properly evaluate parallels with human capabilities.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

AB  - Detecting activated regions in the human brain by cognitive tasks is a significant task in the data analysis using functional MRI (FMRI). To create a detection statistic for activation, noise models under two assumptions; 1) spatial independence and 2) space-time separability have been dominantly used in the FMRI data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel detection statistic derived from noise models with spatiotemporal correlation and without space-time separability. In order to obtain a sufficiently flexible class of noise models for non- separable space-time processes, an unusual noise modeling based on truncated cepstrum expansion is suggested. Developed methods are applied to a human dataset.

AB  - The 21st century will see a renewed focus on intermodal freight transportation driven by the changing requirements of global supply chains. Each of the transportation modes (air, inland water, ocean, pipeline, rail, and road) has gone through technological evolution and has functioned separately under a modally based regulatory structure for most of the 20th century. With the development of containerization in the mid-1900s, the reorientation toward deregulation near the end of the century, and a new focus on logistics and global supply chain requirements, the stage is set for continued intermodal transportation growth. The growth of intermodal freight transportation will be driven and challenged by four factors: (a) measuring, understanding, and responding to the role of intermodalism in the changing customer requirements and hypercompetition of supply chains in a global marketplace; (b) the need to reliably and flexibly respond to changing customer requirements with seamless and integrated coordination of freight and equipment flows through various modes; (c) knowledge of current and future intermodal operational options and alternatives, as well as the potential for improved information and communications technology and the challenges associated with their application; and (d) constraints on and coordination of infrastructure capacity, including policy and regulatory issues, as well as better management of existing infrastructure and broader considerations on future investment in new infrastructure.

AB  - Time non-separable preferences are used in combination with various specifications of the endowment process to calibrate the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Time non-separability is caused either by habit persistence or durability. It is demonstrated that the model can indeed produce the amount of mean reversion detected in historical returns. Specifically, habit persistence is required to match negative autocorrelation of annual asset returns and durability is needed to replicate positive autocorrelation detected in monthly asset returns. In addition, the CAPM with habit persistence can predict negative expected returns when calibrated to monthly data. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to extend research which has looked at moral judgment. Specifically, the study examines the impact of moral judgment on the budget allocations made by government budget officers. Additionally, and as a result of previous research findings, the study looks at the relationship between political ideology, gender, age, profession and moral judgment. Results support prior research which has found an association between political ideology and moral judgment, and between gender and moral judgment. There was no indication that the level of moral judgment among accountants is different from that of other individuals serving as budget officers, or that age is significantly related to moral judgment. Additionally, the study finds that an individual's level of moral judgment has less of an impact on the individual's actions than does political ideology. Study results contribute to an understanding of the relationship of moral judgment to accounting, and the relationship of moral judgment to behavior. The study also adds to research into the relationship of political ideology and moral judgment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

It would be appropriate for graduate students in education, human services, social sciences, or theology, or any person committed to the endeavor and process of education. "The Paradigm Dialog is one of those rare books that simultaneously stretches the mind while projecting one into self-reflection. For the applied practitioner, whether teacher, counselor, or consultant, the possibility of gaining further insight into the underlying assumptions which constrain one's pedagogy or practice is highly possible upon a critical reading." -The Journal of Applied Rehabilitation Counseling Is scientific positivism, long the reigning paradigm for research in the social sciences, the "best way" to conduct social research? This is the central question examined in The Paradigm Dialog. Recently three key challengers have appeared-postpositivism, critical theory, and constructivism. All three offer researchers new methodological approaches, and all three present fundamental questions that must be addressed. Can research be conducted between paradigms?

It would be appropriate for graduate students in education, human services, social sciences, or theology, or any person committed to the endeavor and process of education. "The Paradigm Dialog is one of those rare books that simultaneously stretches the mind while projecting one into self-reflection.

AB  - A central component of mind wandering is mental time travel, the calling to mind of remembered past events and of imagined future ones. Mental time travel may also be critical to the evolution of language, which enables us to communicate about the non-present, sharing memories, plans, and ideas. Mental time travel is indexed in humans by hippocampal activity, and studies also suggest that the hippocampus in rats is active when the animals replay or pre play activity in a spatial environment, such as a maze. Mental time travel may have ancient origins, contrary to the view that it is unique to humans. Since mental time travel is also thought to underlie language, these findings suggest that language evolved gradually from pre-existing cognitive capacities, contrary to the view of Chomsky and others that language and symbolic thought emerged abruptly, in a single step, within the past 100,000 years.

AB  - Non-human primates exhibit similar physiological and behavioral responses to anxiety-inducing situations as humans and have, in fact, been successfully employed in both conditioned (i.e. conflict paradigms) and ethologically based tests of fear/anxiety (i.e. involuntary isolation, social interaction, human threat, predator confrontation). In the last decade, a renewed and growing interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of the small callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety, addressing their advantages, shortcomings, and conceptual framework on which they are based. Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and fear-induced avoidance in callitrichids-the marmoset predator confrontation test-is discussed. Copyright ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This article contains the argument that the human ability to travel mentally in time constitutes a discontinuity between ourselves and other animals. Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. It is not an isolated module, but depends on the sophistication of other cognitive capacities, including self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception- knowledge relationship, and dissociation of imagined mental states from one's present mental state. These capacities are also important aspects of so-called "theory of mind", and they appear to mature in children at around age four. Furthermore, mental time travel is generative, involving the combination and recombination of familiar elements, and in this respect may have been a precursor to language. Current evidence, although indirect or based on anecdote rather than on systematic study, suggests that nonhuman animals, including the great apes, are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. In contrast, mental time travel by humans is relatively unconstrained, and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning. Past and future events loom large in much of human thinking, giving rise to cultural, religious, and scientific concepts about origins, destiny, and time itself.

AB  - Although there are hundreds of airports that support commercial air passenger traffic in the United States (US), not all areas are equivalently served by the commercial air transportation system. Locations in the US differ with respect to their level of access to the commercial air network and their overall accessibility within the system. Given the complexity of the domestic commercial air passenger network and supporting infrastructure, past research has only been able to provide a limited assessment of locational accessibility within the United States. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a new metric that incorporates measures of access to air transport as well as accessibility within air transportation networks. Using a comprehensive dataset on scheduled airline service, the developed approach is then applied to the US domestic commercial passenger air transportation network to explore geographic differentials in accessibility. Results suggest marked differences between core-based statistical areas throughout the US. ?? 2010.

AB  - This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific arc-elasticities. In contrast with the usual methodologies, the present methodology is not based on a statistical analysis of disaggregate data on actual modal choices and transport tariffs. This is a particularly useful feature since such data are mostly not available for freight transports in Europe. Furthermore, it fully takes into account the detailed characteristics of the network, all available routes and combinations of modes, as well as the specific localisation of activities within the network. Its estimates are compared with previously published estimates, and, in particular, with Abdelwahab's results published (1998) in this journal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Emphasis was placed on major terminal areas and on the denser portions of the enroute airspace where the need for efficient use of scarce resources (principally runways and terminal airspace) and the danger of mid-air collisions make sophisticated air traffic control mandatory if safety is to be assured without sacrifice of capacity. Airports were included in the study insofar as they strongly interact with air traffic control, and then, primarily, the committee's concern was with efficient use of runways. No work was done on airport access. Considerable effort was placed on the subject of noise reduction which may be critical to community acceptance of high-capacity airports.

AB  - Managing budget for optimum effectiveness at various levels of the university is always a challenging task. This calls for a highly effective budget planning. Budget planning enables an organization to set priorities towards achieving certain goals and to identify highest priorities to be accomplished with the available funds. Our study is concerned with the budget allocation in one of the public universities in Malaysia. Preliminary data analysis has been conducted to analyse the budget performance involving data concerning budget allocations of three groups of faculties. The purpose of the analysis is to determine the allocation proportions among these groups and to identify the faculties that have the greatest cumulative effect on the university budget allocation. These results will provide significant insights for the management in dealing with planning budget allocation. This paper describes the data, concepts, structures, categories, processes, results and discussions, including the Pareto analysis, that have been conducted.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Results, based on a large national sample, revealed that over a 28-year period, GMA affected growth in 2 indicators of extrinsic career success (income and occupational prestige), such that the careers of high-GMA individuals ascended more steeply over time than those of low-GMA individuals. Part of the reason high-GMA individuals had steeper growth in extrinsic success over time was because they attained more education, completed more job training, and gravitated toward more complex jobs. GMA also moderated the degree to which within-individual variation in the mediating variables affected within-individual variation in extrinsic career success over time: Education, training, and job complexity were much more likely to translate into career success for more intelligent individuals.

AB  - Since the discovery of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) causing AIDS-like diseases in Asian macaques, non-human primates (NHP) have played an important role in AIDS vaccine research. A multitude of vaccines and immunization approaches have been evaluated, including live attenuated viruses, DNA vaccines, viral and bacterial vectors, subunit proteins, and combinations thereof. Depending on the particular vaccine and model used, varying degrees of protection have been achieved, including prevention of infection, reduction of viral load, and amelioration of disease. In a few instances, potential safety concerns and vaccine-enhanced pathogenicity have also been noted. In the past decade, sophisticated methodologies have been developed to define the mechanisms of protective immunity. However, a clear road map for HIV vaccine development has yet to emerge. This is in part because of the intrinsic nature of the surrogate model and in part because of the improbability of any single model to fully capture the complex interactions of natural HIV infection in humans. The lack of standardization, the limited models available, and the incomplete understanding of the immunobiology of NHP contribute to the difficulty to extrapolate findings from such models to HIV vaccine development. Until efficacy data become available from studies of parallel vaccine concepts in humans and macaques, the predictive value of any NHP model remains unknown. Towards this end, greater appreciation of the utility and limitations of the NHP model and further developments to better mimic HIV infection in humans will likely help inform future AIDS vaccine efforts.

This is both the case for foreign and security politics, including war, where the use by states (as principals) of agents such as guerrilla movements, militias and private military companies (PMCs) is becoming more frequent. The special case of PMCs is analysed at length, coming out in favour of a combined legalisation and regulation, which is found to open up opportunities for military missions such as humanitarian interventions, not least in Africa, which would otherwise not be undertaken.

AB  - Non-human primates (NHPs) are used to model human disease owing to their remarkably similar genomes, physiology, and immune systems. Recently, there has been an increased interest in modeling tuberculosis (TB) in NHPs. Macaques are susceptible to infection with different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), producing the full spectrum of disease conditions, including latent infection, chronic progressive infection, and acute TB, depending on the route and dose of infection. Clearly, NHPs are an excellent model of human TB. While the initial aim of the NHP model was to allow preclinical testing of candidate vaccines and drugs, it is now also being used to study pathogenesis and immune correlates of protection. Recent advances in this field are discussed in this review. Key questions such as the effect of hypoxia on the biology of Mtb and the basis of reactivation of latent TB can now be investigated through the use of this model.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands.

AB  - Most arguments against the possibility of time travel use the same old, familiar objection: If I could travel back in time, then I could kill my earlier (i.e., younger) self. Since I do exist such an action would result in a contradiction. Therefore time travel is impossible. This is a statement of the Principal Paradox of Time Travel. Some philosophers have argued that such actions as attempting to kill one's earlier self would always fail and that there is nothing especially strange about such failures. Despite these arguments, the problem generally is not viewed as being solved in favour of time travel. The above objection to time travel is also used to dismiss a particular class of cosmological models as being unphysical. This paper provides a solution to the Principal Paradox by exploring both the logical and causal implications of time travel.

AB  - Government authorities are responsible for managing their available budget so that they gain maximum benefit. Therefore, they must make intelligent decisions as to which projects will be funded and the degree of funding. Dynamic programming (DP), integer programming (IP), and greedy heuristic (GH) approaches have been applied to optimize a two-year budget allocation for repainting steel bridges in Indiana. The optimal solution and the objective function values resulting from application of DP, IP, and GH are similar. The Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) divides Indiana into six districts. The results show that District 1 has the highest budget allocation percentage (28%). It has the lowest percent in the first year and the highest percent in the second year. District 2 has the lowest percentage (11%). A sensitivity analysis has been completed to show the potential alternative solutions that assist INDOT decision makers in solving their budget allocation problems.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the causal effect of deliberate mental time travel (MTT) on happiness and anxiety. More specifically, we address whether purposely engaging in positive, negative, or neutral future MTT would lead to different levels of happiness and anxiety. Results show a significant increase of happiness for subjects in the positive condition after 2 weeks but no changes in the negative or neutral condition. Additionally, while positive or negative MTT had no effect on anxiety, engaging in neutral MTT seems to significantly reduce stress over 15 days. These findings suggest that positive future MTT is not just a consequence of happiness and might be related to well-being in a causal fashion and provide a new approach in happiness boosting and stress-reducing activities.

To overcome these problems, we present a simple universally available approach that combines pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging and the non-surgical creation of reference points (teeth marking). We have found that this approach improves stereotaxic targeting reliability and permits accurate reproducible stereotaxic localization at time points distant from the pre-operative imaging.

We find that WMN is a small-world network with power law behavior. Important nodes are identified based on different centrality measures. Through analyzing weighted clustering coefficient and weighted average nearest neighbors degree, we reveal the hierarchy structure and rich-club phenomenon in the network. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although transportation costs can form more than 50% of the total logistics costs of a product, they are often neglected in lot-sizing research and modelling. Nonetheless, the body of research that does take transportation costs into account is gradually growing. The bulk of this type of research, however, assumes that freight rates decrease as shipping weights and/or volumes increase. Inspired by the situation with a large European manufacturing company, we study a multi-product lot-sizing model where, in any period, any portion of a reserved transportation capacity can be used in exchange for a guaranteed price. If the capacity is insufficient, then the shipper needs to contract additional transportation capacity on the spot market, where the prevailing price is higher. Accordingly, the freight rates are piece-wise linearly increasing in our model. We prove that the problem of determining transportation lot-sizes so as to meet warehouse demand with no backlogging allowed and to minimize total costs, that is, the sum of inventory carrying, ordering, and transportation costs, is script N sign???-hard in the strong sense. Furthermore, we present a Lagrangean relaxation algorithm to compute lower and upper bounds, of which comprehensive computational experiments show the compelling performance in terms of quality and speed. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study determined how scar formation develops in a non-human primate model of fetal skin repair. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: A transition from healing scarlessly to healing with scar formation characterizes skin repair in rat and sheep fetuses. New knowledge of the regulatory processes occurring in the fetal wound at the initial stages of scar formation may provide insights into the early mechanisms of scar formation. METHODS: Full-thickness wounds were made in fetal rhesus monkey lips from 75 through 114 days gestation (n = 6, term = 165 days). Wounds were harvested at 14 days postwounding and processed for histology (hematoxylin & eosin, Masson's trichrome) as well as immunohistochemistry (human type I or type III collagen). RESULTS: Wounds healed with complete restoration of normal tissue architecture in the 75-day gestation fetus. However in the 85-100 day gestation fetuses, wounds healed with an absence of hair follicles and sebaceous glands, but the dermal collagen pattern remained reticular and similar to that in unwounded dermis. At 107 days, a thin scar was present in the wound, thereby demonstrating a transition to scar formation between 100 and 107 days gestation (early 3rd trimester) in the non-human primate. CONCLUSIONS: In the non-human primate fetus, a transition from scarless repair to adult-type repair with scar formation occurs in the early third trimester. These data provide insight into the transition process; the ontogeny of scar formation is characterized initially by wounds healing without the presence of epidermal appendages but with a normal reticular dermal collagen pattern, which we term the "transition wound."

AB  - The research presented in this paper develops a particle filter approach for the real-time short to medium-term travel time prediction using real-time and historical data. Given the challenges in defining the particle filter time update process, the proposed algorithm selects particles from a historical database and propagates particles using historical data sequences as opposed to using a state-transition model. A partial resampling strategy is then developed to address the degeneracy problem by replacing invalid or low weighted particles with historical data that provide similar data sequences to real-time traffic measurements. As a result, each particle generates a predicted travel time with a corresponding weight that represents the level of confidence in the prediction. Consequently, the prediction can produce a distribution of travel times by aggregating all weighted particles. A 95-mile freeway stretch from Richmond to Virginia Beach along I-64 and I-264 is used to test the proposed algorithm. Both the absolute and relative prediction errors using the leave-one-out cross validation concept demonstrate that the proposed method produces the least deviation from ground truth travel times, compared to instantaneous travel times, two Kalman filter algorithms and a K nearest neighbor (k-NN) method. Moreover, the maximum prediction error for the proposed method is the least of all the algorithms and maintains a stable performance for all test days. The confidence boundaries of the predicted travel times demonstrate that the proposed approach provides good accuracy in predicting travel time reliability. Lastly, the fast computation time and online processing ensure the method can be used in real-time applications.

AB  - Business executives and academics frequently criticize budget- based compensation plans as providing incentives for subordinates to build slack into proposed budgets. In this paper, we examine whether either of two practices—using budgets to allocate scarce resources, or providing informa- tion about co-workers—reduces budget slack and increases subordinate per- formance when organizations use budgets for performance evaluation. The results from our experiment show that using budgets for both resource allo- cation and performance evaluation not only eliminates budget slack, but also increases subordinates' effort and task performance. Additionally, we find that an internal reporting system that provides information about subordinates' budgets and performance to their co-workers mitigates budget slack when superiors do not use budgets as a basis for resource allocation. These results highlight the synergies between the planning (resource allocation) and control (performance evaluation) functions of managerial accounting practices such as budgeting. Our results also suggest that by designing the internal infor- mation system to reduce information asymmetry among subordinates, the firm can increase subordinates' incentives to provide more accurate budgets

AB  - Noradrenergic terminals in the central nervous system are widespread; as such this system plays a role in varying functions such as stress responses, sympathetic regulation, attention, and memory processing, and its dysregulation has been linked to several pathologies. In particular, the norepinephrine transporter is a target in the brain of many therapeutic and abused drugs. We used the selective ligand [3H]nisoxetine, therefore, to describe autoradiographically the normal regional distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate central nervous system, thereby providing a baseline to which alterations due to pathological conditions can be compared. The norepinephrine transporter in the monkey brain was distributed heterogeneously, with highest levels occurring in the locus coeruleus complex and raphe nuclei, and moderate binding density in the hypothalamus, midline thalamic nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and brainstem nuclei such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Low levels of binding to the norepinephrine transporter were measured in basolateral amygdala and cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. The distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate brain was comparable overall to that described in other species, however disparities exist between the rodent and the monkey in brain regions that play a role in such critical processes as memory and learning. The differences in such areas point to the possibility of important functional differences in noradrenergic information processing across species, and suggest the use of caution in applying findings made in the rodent to the human condition. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

AB  - Nonhuman primate species have been selectively used in the scientific investigation of adult and newborn neurological diseases. The rhesus monkey has been utilized in models of term asphyxial insults, accurately reflecting the mechanisms and neuropathology demonstrated in the newborn human infant. More recently, a premature baboon model developed for evaluation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been applied to the investigation of cerebral development and injury, revealing high similarity in neuropathology to the premature human infant. Given the differences in the outcomes of neuroprotective therapies between lower order species, such as the rat, and human trials in disorders such as stroke, nonhuman primate models may provide an invaluable resource for safety and efficacy testing before trials in human newborns. This article summarizes both models of brain injury. The histologic findings from the models are compared with neuropathological studies in human infants. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate that has been used as a non-human primate model for various biomedical studies. We previously demonstrated that transplantation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs) derived from mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) promote functional locomotor recovery of mouse spinal cord injury models. However, for the clinical application of such a therapeutic approach, we need to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pluripotent stem cell-derived NS/PCs not only by xenotransplantation, but also allotransplantation using non-human primate models to assess immunological rejection and tumorigenicity. In the present study, we established a culture method to efficiently derive NS/PCs as neurospheres from common marmoset ESCs. Marmoset ESC-derived neurospheres could be passaged repeatedly and showed sequential generation of neurons and astrocytes, similar to that of mouse ESC-derived NS/PCs, and gave rise to functional neurons as indicated by calcium imaging. Although marmoset ESC-derived NS/PCs could not differentiate into oligodendrocytes under default culture conditions, these cells could abundantly generate oligodendrocytes by incorporating additional signals that recapitulate in vivo neural development. Moreover, principal component analysis of microarray data demonstrated that marmoset ESC-derived NS/PCs acquired similar gene expression profiles to those of fetal brain-derived NS/PCs by repeated passaging. Therefore, marmoset ESC-derived NS/PCs may be useful not only for accurate evaluation by allotransplantation of NS/PCs into non-human primate models, but are also applicable to analysis of iPSCs established from transgenic disease model marmosets.

AB  - Increasing evidence focuses on acetaldehyde (ACD) as the mediator of the rewarding and motivational properties of ethanol. Indeed, ACD stimulates dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and it is self-administered under different conditions. Besides the dopaminergic transmission, the endocannabinoid system has been reported to play an important role in ethanol central effects, modulating primary alcohol rewarding effect, drug-seeking, and relapse behavior. Drug motivational properties are highlighted in operant paradigms which include response-contingent punishment, a behavioral equivalent of compulsive drug use despite adverse consequences. The aim of this study was thus to characterize ACD motivational and rewarding properties employing an operant-conflict paradigm in which rats, trained to lever press in order to get ACD solution (0.9%), undergo extinction, reinstatement and conflict sessions, according to a modified Geller-Seifter procedure. Furthermore, the role played by CB1 receptor system in modulating ACD-induced effects were investigated through the administration of CB1 receptor antagonist, AM281 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) during the extinction-, relapse-, and conflict-experiments. Our results indicate that ACD is able to induce and maintain an operant behavior, a high number of responses during extinction, an increase in the lever presses during the reinstatement phase, and a higher emission of punished responses during the conflict experiments, when compared to controls. The administration of AM281 is able to decrease ACD-seeking behavior during extinction, the number of lever presses during reinstatement and to strongly decrease the punished responses for ACD. Our data strengthen the idea that ACD may be responsible for the central effects of ethanol, and pinpoint at the CB1 system as one of the neural substrates underlying its addictive properties.

AB  - Many of the meta-theoretical issues raised by current postmodernist contributions to IR theory were on the agenda much earlier in the European IR debate. Even if postmodernist thinking has brought a fresh burst of inspiration to IR, its meta-theoretical reflection is not well suited for the construction of better analytical tools in the discipline. This is demonstrated in the assessment of two recent contributions by Ferguson & Mansbach and Biersteker. It is argued that Neo-Marxist and NeoRealist thinking provides a better basis for the construction of a revised paradigm. Basing itself in particular on contributions by Ougaard and Buzan, the article attempts to construct such a revised paradigm for international relations. The paradigm contains three main elements: (a) a concept of state and social formation; (b) a concept of the global system, and (c) a comprehensive concept of security. It is argued that the scope of the paradigm covers Globalist, Realist and Pluralist areas of study, and even claims relevance for several of the issues raised in postmodernist contributions.

AB  - Budgetary allocations of resources are made in all businesses, but their volume and composition vary; and efficient budget allocation is fundamental to flow in businesses. The objective of the allocation problem is to determine the required budget for each department (or section) of a company so as to maximize the sum of the company's benefits. The purpose of this paper is to find a suitable degree of fuzziness for preference rankings and to demonstrate an example of budget allocation using artificial intelligence programming, and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). An efficient budget allocation method using FAHP will be provided for businesses. This method is suitable for use in evaluating proposed policies (including tangible and intangible information). A comparison between FAHP and artificial neural network (ANN) will be also made in this paper. An aerospace company's budget allocation problem is investigated as a case study in this research, which will illustrate how to solve this problem. The case study utilizes a two-stage interview (semi-structured interview and in-depth interview) to select their budget allocations given a number of tangible and intangible criteria. The results from the case study are pertinent to other real-world allocation problems that share many of the characteristics of problems, such as decision makers' subjective opinions. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The problem of Network Aggregation is defined as the simplification of the number of nodes and links in a transportation network. The objective of a network aggregation technique is to reproduce the level-of-service attributes (such as travel time) between any two points using a spider network as a proxy for the detailed. The aggregation procedure categorizes links into functional groups such as access, egress, line-haul, bypass and intra zonal circulation—which is a convenient classification in terms of transportation analysis. The technique presented here has several distinguishing advantages. First, certain invariance properties are maintained—for example the total trip miles of travel is the same whether measured in the aggregate or detailed networks. Second, the method is systematic, rather than judgemental, which means the inaccuracies introduced as a result of network aggregation can be measured in a scientific way.

AB  - Each stakeholder in the air transportation system has a different perspective on the performance efficiency metrics, making analysis of system-wide design options very difficult. This paper uses topological structures of service networks to examine trade-offs between efficiency metrics established around the passenger, airline, and air navigation service provider perspectives. The findings indicate that the scale-free type topologies are preferred under most of the metrics. However, with enough density, random topologies become more appealing with its high robustness feature and performance comparable to scale-free. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A core brain network is engaged in remembering the past and envisioning the future. This network overlaps with the so-called default-mode network, the activity of which increases when demands for focused attention are low. Because of their shared brain substrates, an intriguing hypothesis is that default-mode activity, measured at rest, is related to performance in separate attention-focused recall and imagination tasks. However, we do not know how functional connectivity of the default-mode network is related to individual differences in reconstruction of the past and imagination of the future. Here, we show that functional connectivity of the default-mode network in children and adolescents is related to the quality of past remembering and marginally to future imagination. These results corroborate previous findings of a common neuronal substrate for memory and imagination and provide evidence suggesting that mental time travel is modulated by the task-independent functional architecture of the default-mode network in the developing brain. A further analysis showed that local cortical arealization also contributed to explain recall of the past and imagination of the future, underscoring the benefits of studying both functional and structural properties to understand the brain basis for complex human cognition.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer service goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling efforts and mathematical programming developments for network design. A new classification of service network design problems and formulations is also introduced.

AB  - Short-term outcomes following organ transplantation have improved considerably since the availability of cyclosporine ushered in the modern era of immunosuppression. In spite of this, many of the current limitations to progress in the field are directly related to the existing practice of relatively non-specific immunosuppression. These include increased risks of opportunistic infection and cancer, and toxicity associated with long-term immunosuppressive drug exposure. In addition, long-term graft loss continues to result in part from a failure to adequately control the anti-donor immune response. The development of a safe and reliable means of inducing tolerance would ameliorate these issues and improve the lives of transplant recipients, yet given the improving clinical standard of care, the translation of new therapies has become appropriately more cautious and dependent on increasingly predictive preclinical models. While convenient and easy to use, rodent tolerance models have not to date been reliably capable of predicting a therapy's potential efficacy in humans. Non-human primates possess an immune system that more closely approximates that found in humans, and have served as a more rigorous preclinical testing ground for novel therapies. Prior to clinical adaptation therefore, tolerance regimens should be vetted in non-human primates to ensure that there is sufficient potential for efficacy to justify the risk of its application.

AB  - Based on over of two years of CRU research, this paper brings together the findings of five studies of states that show clear signs of illegitimacy or of a weak capacity to govern. Studies of Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guatemala, Kosovo and Pakistan, each grounded in extensive fieldwork involving numerous political and social actors, aim to shed light on the roots and dynamics of fragility by placing the spotlight on the way political power works. The paper highlights the issues of political economy that give rise to weak or fragile state institutions, freeze or reverse attempted reforms, create public insecurity and paralyse economic development.\n\n \n\nEvidence from the case studies indicates that the political marketplace is playing an ever more crucial role in determining the destiny of fragile states. Greater electoral competition, institutional complexity and the entry of new players and sources of ready cash – including foreign donors, natural resource exports and organized crime – are driving new conflicts, and alienating the public from their rulers. Where great progress appears to have been made, whether in the loya jirga of post-Taliban Afghanistan, the transition to independence in Kosovo, or the end of conflict and the inclusion of Mayan communities in Guatemalan political life, it has also brought with it alarming new quandaries. In each case, the new character of political life has empowered armed groups and criminals, or fostered clandestine practices in government.\n\n \n\nThe paper concludes with suggestions that may help guide a pragmatic and realistic approach. Above all, donors must be constantly sensitive to the structures of power, interests and incentives that may capture and subvert new formal governance arrangements, and strive wherever possible to support a shared political strategy aimed at building a state in the common interest.

AB  - Since the early 1980s, the concept of relationship marketing has gained increased acceptance in the field of general marketing, and particularly that of direct and interactive marketing. One of the major benefits of relationship marketing is the ability to make decisions based on their impact on customer equity. In this paper, we offer a general approach to the organization of promotion budget allocation, where the objective function is to maximize customer equity. A cornerstone in our study is the use of decision calculus in which managers' judgments and/or estimates serve as some of the inputs to formal modeling. A series of applications of our approach to promotion budget allocation are offered under different market conditions. These applications focus on promotional expenditure allocation decisions between acquisition and retention, as well as among different promotional options for each category of expenditure. The paper also treats potential cases of synergy, or interaction, between promotional vehicles when applied to the same market segment. ?? Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - (from cnn.com) No one can say exactly what it looks like when a planet takes ill, but it probably looks a lot like Earth. Never mind what you've heard about global warming as a slow-motion emergency that would take decades to play out. Suddenly and unexpectedly, the crisis is upon us.  From heat waves to storms to floods to fires to massive glacial melts, the global climate seems to be crashing around us. The problem -- as scientists suspected but few others appreciated -- is that global climate systems are booby-trapped with tipping points and feedback loops, thresholds past which the slow creep of environmental decay gives way to sudden and self-perpetuating collapse. That's just what's happening now.  It's at the north and south poles -- where ice cover is crumbling to slush -- that the crisis is being felt the most acutely. Late last year, for example, researchers analyzed data from Canadian and European satellites and found that the Greenland ice sheet is not only melting, but doing so faster and faster, with 53 cubic miles draining away into the sea last year alone, compared to 23 cubic miles in 1996.  One of the reasons the loss of the planet's ice cover is accelerating is that as the poles' bright white surface disappears it changes the relationship of the Earth and the sun. Polar ice is so reflective that 90 percent of the sunlight that strikes it simply bounces back into space, taking its energy with it. Ocean water does just the opposite, absorbing 90 percent of the light and heat it receives, meaning that each mile of ice that melts vanishes faster than the mile that preceded it. This is what scientists call a feedback loop, and a similar one is also melting the frozen land called permafrost, much of which has been frozen -- since the end of last ice age in fact, or at least 8,000 years ago.  Sealed inside that cryonic time capsule are layers of decaying organic matter, thick with carbon, which itself can transform into CO2. In places like the southern boundary of Alaska the soil is now melting and softening.  As fast as global warming is changing the oceans and ice caps, it's having an even more immediate effect on land. Droughts are increasingly common as higher temperatures also bake moisture out of soil faster, causing dry regions that live at the margins to tip into full-blown crisis.  Wildfires in such sensitive regions as Indonesia, the western U.S. and even inland Alaska have been occurring with increased frequency as timberlands grow more parched. Those forests that don't succumb to fire can simply die from thirst.  With habitats crashing, the animals that call them home are succumbing too. In Alaska, salmon populations are faltering as melting permafrost pours mud into rivers, burying the gravel the fish need for spawning. Small animals such as bushy tailed rats, chipmunks and pinion mice are being chased upslope by rising temperatures, until they at last have no place to run. And with sea ice vanishing, polar bears are starting to turn up drowned. "There will be no polar ice by 2060," says Larry Schweiger, president of the National Wildlife Federation. "Somewhere along that path, the polar bear drops out."  So much environmental collapse has at last awakened much of the world, particularly the 141 nations that have ratified the Kyoto treaty to reduce emissions. The Bush administration, however, has shown no willingness to address the warming crisis in a serious way and Congress has not been much more encouraging.  Sens. John McCain and Joe Lieberman have twice been unable to get even mild measures to limit carbon emissions through a recalcitrant Senate.  A 10-member House delegation did recently travel to Antarctica, Australia and New Zealand to meet with scientists studying climate change. "Of the 10 of us, only three were believers to begin with," says Rep. Sherman Boehlert of New York. "Every one of the others said this opened their eyes."  But lawmakers who still applaud themselves for recognizing global warming are hardly the same as lawmakers with the courage to reverse it, and increasingly, state and local governments are stepping forward.  The mayors of more than 200 cities have signed the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, pledging, among other things, that they will meet the Kyoto goal of reducing greenhouse emissions in their own cities to 1990 levels by 2012. Nine northeastern states have established the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative for the purpose of developing a program to cap greenhouse gasses.

Formula method may keep the library from allo- cating appropriate budgetary resource in adding new book collections needed in every academic field. Consequently, the library collection would suffer. This study was proposed using Linear Goal Programming method to deal with the budget allocation of university libraries; it established an ideal, practical, flexible, and fair budget allocation model using goal programming of two dimensions. This inteactive model can reduce budgetary disputes among instructional units, be applied to collection development policy, and be applied in the decision making of the budget allocation of university libraries.

Beginning with a brief outline of the background to the transportation problem in Dublin, the article goes on to outline the objectives of the Study and the methods by which these objectives were fulfilled. These methods involved the taking of detailed inventories of Dublin's travel patterns, of its land uses, population and employment, and of its road and public transport systems. Mathematical models were then developed and modified until they could simulate the existing travel patterns to an acceptable degree of accuracy. These models covered the Study's trip generation, modal split, trip distribution and trip assignment stages, and the forms taken by the models are dealt with in the article.

AB  - Developed a laboratory paradigm for examining interorganizational conflict and its management. 62 3-person groups (drawn randomly from 282 business administration students) participated 2 groups at a time. One group acted as manufacturer and the other as wholesaler, their goal being agreement on the price and quantity of microscalpels. Conflict was induced by presenting a profit-loss matrix, a bogus distribution of past groups' earnings, and contrived information on complementary skills of group members. Semantic differential responses differed significantly (p < .05) for conflict-management groups (superordinate goal, and exchange of persons) and no-conflict-management groups, indicating lessening conflict in the former groups. There were no specific differences on in-group/out-group items. Expressive-Malintegrative Behavior Indexes, derived from Bales's Interaction Process Analysis, provided further support for the exchange-of-persons strategy.

AB  - Cribra orbitalia, a porous lesion involving the orbital roofs, is one of the most-studied skeletal pathologies in bioarchaeology, and yet uncertainty still exists regarding its aetiology and significance. In contrast to the hundreds of reports of cribra orbitalia in human skeletal remains, little is known of this condition in non-human primates. Previously, cribra orbitalia has only been reported in catarrhines, with just two cases in cercopithecoids. To provide a broader, phylogenetic perspective on cribra orbitalia, a sample of primate skeletal material was examined to evaluate the occurrence of this condition. The taxonomically diverse sample consists of 380 non-hominoid (non-ape) modern primates from both wild and captive populations. Cribra orbitalia is present in 16 individuals, including cercopithecines, colobines, platyrrhines and a prosimian, substantially expanding the known taxonomic range of this condition. Modern primates—with their varied habitats, diets, levels of parasitism, etc.— provide a set of natural experiments regarding conditions and physiologies which may influence the aetiology and impact of cribra orbitalia. More generally, it is suggested here that studies of non-human primate skeletal pathologies have the potential for providing significant insight on human paleopathologies.

In this paper, we calculate the Length-radius dimension of transportation network of Tianjin city with the help of the software Mathematica, whose results mean that the transportation network of the city has fractal characteristics. The value of length-radius dimension is 1.6403, which shows that the transportation network of the city is close to maturity. The box dimension of different districts of the main city has also been calculated at the scale of 100 to 600 m in this research and the results show that the value is between 1.5027 and 1.6312. It can be concluded that Heping district is the region with the biggest density, most complex structure, best connectivity and most mature function of transportation network in the whole city. According to the study, we obtained that the combination of length-radius dimensions and box dimensions enables the comprehensive analysis of spatial pattern characteristics of density, structure, connectivity and function of transportation network.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

AB  - Based on quantitative and qualitative studies in a variety of mammalian species, it would appear that a significant portion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage is associated with transport along cranial and spinal nerves with absorption taking place into lymphatic vessels external to the central nervous system. CSF appears to convect primarily through the cribriform plate into lymphatics associated with the submucosa of the olfactory and respiratory epithelium. However, the significance of this pathway for CSF absorption in primates has never been established unequivocally. In past studies, we infused Microfil into the subarachnoid compartment of numerous species to visualize CSF transport pathways. The success of this method encouraged us to use a similar approach in the non-human primate. Yellow Microfil was injected post mortem into the cisterna magna of 6 years old Barbados green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabeus, n = 6). Macroscopic and microscopic examination revealed that Microfil was (1) distributed throughout the subarachnoid compartment, (2) located in the perineurial spaces associated with the fila olfactoria, (3) present within the olfactory submucosa, and (4) situated within an extensive network of lymphatic vessels in the nasal submucosa, nasal septum and turbinate tissues. We conclude that the Microfil distribution patterns in the monkey were very similar to those observed in many other species suggesting that significant nasal lymphatic uptake of CSF occurs in the non-human primate.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

AB  - Developmental cognitive neuroscience is an evolving field that investigates the relations between neural and cognitive development. Lying at the intersection of diverse disciplines, work in this area promises to shed light on classic developmental questions, mechanisms subserving developmental change, diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders, and cognitive and neuroscientific topics traditionally considered outside the domain of development. Fundamental questions include: What are the interrelations between developmental changes in the brain (e.g. in connectivity, chemistry, morphology) and developmental changes in children's behavior and cognitive abilities (e.g. representational complexity, ability to sustain selective attention, speed of processing)? Why, and how, is learning enhanced during certain periods in development? How is our knowledge organized, and how does this change with development? We discuss preliminary investigations of such questions and directions for future work.

AB  - According to Tulving, episodic memory allows humans to travel mentally through subjective time into either the past or the future, this ability being at the origin of adaptation, organization and planning of future behavior. The main aim of this review is to present a state of art of episodic mental time travel and a lifespan perspective from children to elderly people. We examine the numerous similarities between remembering the past and envisioning the future which have been highlighted in cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological studies. We also present studies that have given evidence that remembering the past and imagining the future differ somewhat. We focus on demonstrating that hippocampal dysfunction is associated with disturbances in the recall of episodic autobiographical details in past memories, but also in the imagining of episodic detailed future events. More specifically, we discuss that the future seems to involve higher semantic processes mediated by the inferior frontal and lateral temporal gyri. We propose that the study of mental travel in personal time could be undertaken in line with the distinction between the memory of (episodic) experiences and (semantic) personal knowledge of one's life, which constitutes a major part of the self and constraints what we have been, what we are now, and what we might yet become.

This is, in part, because some experiments which would be difficult or logistically impossible in women are more easily conducted in NHP. Method of study NHP models of HIV can inform HIV acquisition and pathogenesis research and identify and evaluate biomedical preventions and treatments for HIV/ AIDS. Widely used species include rhesus, pigtail, and cynomolgous macaques. Results This paper reviews past, current and proposed NHP research around the intersection of HIV and HC. Conclusion NHP research may lead to the identification of hormonally regulated biomarkers that correlate with HIV-acquisition risk, to a ranking of existing or next-generation HC along an HIV-acquisition risk profile, and inform research around new biomedical preventions for HIV.

AB  - The high resolution research tomography (HRRT) is currently the most complex human brain scanner due to its ability to detect the gamma depth of interaction, its octagonal geometry, and the large number of crystals (119,808) leading to approximately 4.5 &amp;times; 10<sup>9</sup> possible lines of response (LORs). Reconstruction of dynamic studies on this scanner is particularly challenging due to the dynamic range of both, number of acquired events per frame and acquisition count rates. Some artifacts have been observed with phantom studies: here we evaluate their impact on time activity curves (TACs) and binding potential (BP) values in realistic scanning situations with the ultimate goal of defining an efficient and accurate image reconstruction protocol. Non-human primate studies were used for this purpose. We compared TACs and BPs obtained from images reconstructed with three different reconstruction algorithms, two different axial spanning configurations and detector normalization factors obtained from two different data sets. We also compared BP values obtained from scans of the same animal performed on the Siemens ECAT 963B and the HRRT under identical conditions. The statistical reconstruction methods produced nearly identical results and the impact of emission/normalization count rate mismatch was found to be effectively negligible. Likewise no image degradation due to increased axial spanning was observed. Data obtained from the analytical method were less robust and in general much more sensitive to noise, thus demonstrating a suboptimal performance of this algorithm. The BP values obtained with the HRRT were by approximately 50% higher compared to those obtained in the ECAT as a result of the increased resolution of this tomograph.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Complex networks provide a suitable framework to characterize air traffic. Previous works described the world air-transport network as a graph where direct flights are edges and commercial airports are vertices. In this work, we focus instead on the properties of flight delays in the US air- transportation network. We analyze flight performance data in 2010 and study the topological structure of the network as well as the aircraft rotation. The properties of flight delays, including the distribution of total delays, the dependence on the day of the week and the hour-by-hour evolution within each day, are characterized with special attention to flights accumulating delays longer than 12 hours. We find that the distributions are robust to changes in takeoff or landing operations, different moments of the year, or even different airports in the contiguous states. However, airports in remote areas (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico) can show peculiar distributions biased toward long delays. Additionally, we show that long-delayed flights have an important dependence on the destination airport. Keywords

AB  - Ag-specific T cell activation requires a CD28-mediated costimulatory interaction. This observation has suggested novel approaches to suppress donor-specific immunity, including the use of soluble CD28 antagonists, such as CTLA4Ig, which suppresses transplant rejection in small animal models. In this study, CTLA4Ig therapy was examined in a non-human primate model of allogeneic pancreatic islet transplantation. Two of five CTLA4Ig-treated monkeys showed prolonged graft survival, which correlated with donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in vitro. Humoral responses to the transplanted tissue were suppressed in all treated animals. These results suggest that CTLA4Ig is effective in suppressing both humoral and cellular immune responses in a non-human primate model of allogeneic transplantation.

AB  - A simulation-based framework for the modeling of transportation network performance under emergency conditions is presented. The system extends the well-established dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) framework and provides the necessary support for the meaningful study of a wide array of evacuation measures, the development of strategies under different prevailing conditions, and the generation of comprehensive emergency response plans. The system can be used to develop libraries to deal with emergencies and unplanned events, train response personnel and traffic management center operators, provide decision support and assistance for the evacuation of residents from affected areas, and ensure unhindered access to first responders. A variety of practical issues relevant to evacuation modeling are discussed, and the modeling framework is demonstrated by using the Boston, Massachusetts, network as an example. DynaMIT, a state-of-the-art DTA model, is used in the case study to illustrate how the benefits of network management strategies might be ascertained. The paper concludes with future directions, including the integration of simulation modeling as a real-time tool for the management of evolving evacuations.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 produces the biodetergent rhamnolipid and secretes it into the extracellular environment. The role of rhamnolipids in life cycle and pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa has not been completely understood, but they are known to affect outer membrane composition, cell motility and biofilm formation. This report is focussed on the influence of the outer membrane bound esterase EstA of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on rhamnolipid production. EstA is an autotransporter protein which exposes its catalytically active esterase domain on the cell surface. Here we report that the overexpression of EstA in the wildtype background of P. aeruginosa PAO1 results in an increased production of rhamnolipids whereas an estA deletion mutant produced only marginal amounts of rhamnolipids. Also the known rhamnolipid dependent cellular motility and biofilm formation were affected. Although only a dependence of swarming motility on rhamnolipids was known so far also the other kinds of motility displayed by P. aeruginosa PAO1 as swimming and twitching were affected by an estA mutation. In order to demonstrate that EstA enzyme activity is responsible for these effects, an inactive variant EstA was constructed by replacement of the active serine by alanine. None of the mutant phenotypes could be complementd by expression of EstA, demonstrating that the phenotypes affected by the estA mutation depend on the enzymatically active protein.

Our research, in contrast, focuses on describing the interactional small-group practices that take place in learning contexts. This paper considers these practices and how they work together to form the foundation for effective collaborative learning activities. It analyzes collaborative learning activities in a paradigmatic CSCL setting to discuss such small-group practices as: resolving cognitive conflict, pursuing inquiry, maintaining a group problem space and coordinating multiple modes of reasoning. These have broad implications for foundational issues of temporality, indexicality and group cognition.

From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - Background/Aims: Age-related changes in the hepatic sinusoid termed pseudocapillarization have been reported in the rat and human and have implications for disease susceptibility in old age. In this study, we investigated whether similar changes occur in the livers of old baboons and thus represent a widespread aging change. Methods: Liver tissue from five young baboons (5.4??0.5yrs) and five old baboons (21.8??0.7yrs) was compared by transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Results: The thickness of the sinusoidal endothelium was increased in old baboons (130??8 nm versus 186??9 nm, P<0.001) and the frequency of endothelial fenestrae decreased, with the porosity declining from 4.2??0.5% to 2.4??0.4% (P=0.006). The expression of laminin and von Willebrands factor was more extensive in old baboons. Novel perisinusoidal ring-shaped cells, probably fat-engorged stellate cells, were prominent in the old baboons. Conclusions: Pseudocapillarization is a significant age-related change in the baboon liver. Aging in baboons is associated with a novel aging change in the stellate cell not reported in other species. Hepatic pseudocapillarization is a widespread aging liver change found in several species including humans and other non-human primates. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Based on long-term transportation network design decisions and potential parameter variations, it is important that demand uncertainty is considered in transportation modeling. In this paper, we present a novel robustness measure that combines the two objectives by minimizing the expected travel time while bounding the relative regret in each scenario facing uncertain origin-destination demand (OD demand). The concept of ??-robust solution is introduced into the transportation network design problem. We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

AB  - The use of non-human primates provides an excellent translational model for our understanding of developmental and aging processes in humans(1-6). In addition, the use of non-human primates has recently afforded the opportunity to naturally model complex psychiatric disorders such as alcohol abuse(7). Here we describe a technique for blocking the brain in the coronal plane of the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabeus) in the intact skull in stereotaxic space. The method described here provides a standard plane of section between blocks and subjects and minimizes partial sections between blocks. Sectioning a block of tissue in the coronal plane also facilitates the delineation of an area of interest. This method provides manageable sized blocks since a single hemisphere of the vervet monkey yields more than 1200 sections when slicing at 50 microm. Furthermore by blocking the brain into 1cm blocks, it facilitates penetration of sucrose for cyroprotection and allows the block to be sliced on a standard cryostat.

AB  - The typical Geller-Seifter conflict paradigm for predicting clinical efficacy of anxiolytics is a mult VI/CRF schedule in which response rates in the CRF (conflict) portion are depressed by response-contingent electric shock. In 1-h sessions, anxiolytics raise the depressed conflict rates. Recently it was shown that replacing the single shock level with an arrangement whereby shock begins at zero and is increased with each response in the conflict portion produced more orderly data and facilitated training and maintenance of experimental subjects; chlordiazepoxide was the test drug. In the present study, those results are replicated in 30-min sessions, and the incremental paradigm is demonstrated to be as specific for anxiolytics as the standard Geller-Seifter paradigm. The possibility of very short sessions is suggested.

AB  - To provide a common, multi-dimensional framework for integrated conflict prediction and resolution, the concept of conflict probing is used. The conflict probes perform predictions about the future separation with traffic, terrain and other hazards for a range of variations to the current velocity vector. This results in a single matrix with information about the effect on future separation for each particular combination of track and flight path angle contained in the matrix. The concept of total energy is used to provide an upper constraint to the solution space, expressed in maximum potential flight path angle. A cost function is used to prioritize different options. To inform the operator about the scheduled action and/or maneuver options, a graphical user interface, comprising additions to the primary flight display and navigation display, has been designed. The concept is applicable to a range op system authority levels.

Results, based on a large national sample, revealed that over a 28-year period, GMA affected growth in 2 indicators of extrinsic career success (income and occupational prestige), such that the careers of high-GMA individuals ascended more steeply over time than those of low-GMA individuals. Part of the reason high-GMA individuals had steeper growth in extrinsic success over time was because they attained more education, completed more job training, and gravitated toward more complex jobs. GMA also moderated the degree to which within-individual variation in the mediating variables affected within-individual variation in extrinsic career success over time: Education, training, and job complexity were much more likely to translate into career success for more intelligent individuals. © 2010 American Psychological Association.

AB  - The nation has compelling reasons to reduce its consumption of oil and emissions of carbon dioxide. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) promise to contribute to both goals by allowing some miles to be driven on electricity drawn from the grid, with an internal combustion engine that kicks in when the batteries are discharged. However, while battery technology has made great strides in recent years, batteries are still very expensive. Transitions to Alternative Transportation Technologies-Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles builds on a 2008 National Research Council report on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The present volume reviews the current and projected technology status of PHEVs; considers the factors that will affect how rapidly PHEVs could enter the marketplace, including the interface with the electric transmission and distribution system; determines a maximum practical penetration rate for PHEVs consistent with the time frame and factors considered in the 2008 Hydrogen report; and incorporates PHEVs into the models used in the hydrogen study to estimate the costs and impacts on petroleum consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - The present studies were designed to characterize the behavior of Maudsley reactive (MR/Har) and nonreactive (MNRA/Har) rats in a modification of the Geller-Seifter operant conflict paradigm. Food-restricted (85% of free-feeding weights) female MR/Har and MNRA/Har rats were trained to lever press for food reinforcement in a multiple-schedule operant conflict paradigm. In the absence of a tone, a fixed ratio-30 (FR-30) schedule for reinforcement only was in effect (i.e., every 30th lever press resulted in the delivery of a 45-mg food pellet). During the presence of a tone, a fixed ratio-1 (FR-1) schedule of both reinforcement (food) and punishment (0.20 mA footshock applied for 500 ms) was in effect (i.e., each lever press resulted in both food and shock delivery). The tone periods were 27 s in duration and were presented on a variable interval (VI)-120-s schedule (approximately 20 tones/40-min session). Behavioral testing was conducted 5 days/week for 35 weeks. Initially, punished responding between the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rat strains did not differ dramatically. However, over the course of many weeks of conflict testing, rats of the MNRA/Har strain came to accept significantly more shocks than did subjects of the MR/Har strain. A direct examination of footshock sensitivity in these rats revealed that this difference in conflict behavior over time was not due to strain differences in shock sensitivity. The mechanism for this time-dependent difference in conflict behavior between the MR/Har and MNRA/Har rats remains undetermined.

AB  - The principal objective of development planning is human development and the attainment of higher standard of living for the people. This requires a more equitable distribution of development benefits and opportunities, better living environment and empowerment of the poor and marginalised. There is special need to empower women who can act as catalysts for change. In making the development process inclusive, the challenge is to formulate policies and programmes to bridge regional, social and economic disparities in as effective and sustainable a manner as possible. The Eleventh Five Year Plan sought to address this challenge by providing a comprehensive strategy for inclusive development, building on the growing economic strength of the economy in the past decades. This strategy has to be continued and consolidated further in the Twelfth Five Year Plan. The Approach Paper to the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17) rightly stresses the need for more infrastructural investment with the aim of fostering a faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.

These forms of conflict are transcending our conventional understanding of what equates to irregular and regular military activity; the conflict paradigm has shifted and we must adapt our approaches if we are to succeed. From the evidence collected for this paper, it is clear that the challenges of the future will demand even greater institutional agility in the face of major resource constraints and some profoundly worrying dications that the West may be losing the initiative in terms of dictating the way war is fought.

AB  - Americas air transport system is currently faced with two equally important dilemmas. First, congestion and delays associated with the overburdened hub and spoke system will continue to worsen unless dramatic changes are made in the way air transportation services are provided. Second, many communities and various regions of the country have not benefited from the air transport system, which tends to focus its attention on major population centers. An emerging solution to both problems is a Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS), which will utilize a new generation of advanced small aircraft to provide air transport services to those citizens who are poorly served by the hub and spoke system and those citizens who are not served at all. Using new innovations in navigation, communication, and propulsion technologies, these aircraft will enable users to safely and reliably access the over 5,000 general aviation landing facilities around the United States. A small aircraft transportation system holds the potential to revolutionize the way Americans travel and to greatly enhance the use of air transport as an economic development tool in rural and isolated communities across the nation.

AB  - Network location models have been used extensively for siting public and private facilities. In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions. We conclude by identifying promising research directions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes concepts and techniques to measure the flexibility of a transportation system to accommodate changing demands and traffic patterns. Flexibility is increasingly desired as a characteristic of transport systems, particularly in light of changes in supply chains and traffic patterns, and the concern for the vulnerability of the system to both natural disasters and terrorist actions. Two approaches are described. One is based on current methods for estimating system capacity, and the related concept of reserve capacity. This results in a conservative estimate of flexibility. The second approach permits variations in the traffic pattern, in order to more fully capture demand variations that can be accommodated. The described measures are implemented on a containerized freight rail network, as a means of testing their feasibility and potential value as descriptors of system characteristics. The uses of the measures in planning, investment, and policy-making are discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A frontocentral negative ERP-component, the N2, which probably originates from the ACC, is usually enhanced in conflict-trials that demand an unexpected response. We here used stepped adjustment of response expectation in a response-cueing task, and measured how the N2 varied with global and local cue validity. Results showed that, irrespective of the current cue validity, response times, error rates, and the frontocentral components P2, N2 and P3 increased in unexpected trials. Nevertheless, a N2 was also seen in expected trials, and its latency correlated positively with reaction times, indicating that this potential does not express response conflict only. In line with roles suggested for the ACC, we here propose that the N2 is related to the process of response selection which influences subsequent processing stages reflected in the P3. Unexpected revisions of response programs enhance and delay the N2. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the classical facility location problem we consider a graph $G$ with fixed weights on the edges of $G$. The goal is then to find an optimal positioning for a set of facilities on the graph with respect to some objective function. We introduce a new framework for facility location problems, where the weights on the graph edges are not fixed, but rather should be assigned. The goal is to find a valid assignment for which the resulting weighted graph optimizes the facility location objective function. We present algorithms for finding the optimal {\em budget allocation} for the center point problem and for the median point problem on trees. Our algorithms run in linear time, both for the case where a candidate vertex is given as part of the input, and for the case where finding a vertex that optimizes the solution is part of the problem. We also present a hardness result for the general graph case of the center point problem, followed by an $O(\log^2(n))$ approximation algorithm on graphs - with general metric spaces.

AB  - Functionalist scholars have long regarded health service professions as enjoying special privileges because of their pivotal societal function: quality care of citizens.

In this paper I delineate three competing approaches in the post-functionalist debate on service professions -- professional dominance, professional decline and patriarchal control. I use an age-old kind of service work, midwifery, to uncover theoretical shortcomings in the various stances profiled.

AB  - Mental time travel (MTT) is the ability to mentally project oneself backward in time to relive past experiences and forward in time to pre-live possible future experiences. Previous work has focused on MTT in its voluntary (controlled) form. Here, we introduce the notion of involuntary (spontaneous) MTT. We examined involuntary versus voluntary and past versus future MTT in a diary study. We found that involuntary future event representations-defined as representations of possible personal future events that come to mind with no preceding search attempts-were as common as involuntary autobiographical memories and similar to them regarding cuing and subjective qualities. Future MTT involved more positive and idyllic representations than past MTT. MTT into the distant future/past involved more representations of cultural life script events than MTT into the immediate past/future. The findings are discussed in relation to cultural learning and MTT considered as a higher mental process. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Europe faces major challenges when it comes to formulating its transportation policy. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are considered a key tool to create the intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that Europe needs. In freight transportation, ICT is seen as playing a crucial role in providing efficiency in freight transportation operation and in integrating it within the overall ITS that are now being put in place in Europe. The issues and priorities for freight transportation integration with the European ITS are presented, with concentration (as one such priority) on the issue of linking freight transportation management systems with the advanced traffic-management systems of the European ITS. Also covered are the results so far of the thematic network THEMIS, which concentrates on the relation between freight transportation and ITS. A thematic network is a special type of research project, financed by the European Union's Directorate General of Transport and Energy in order to review and synthesize the results of research in a specific field, in this case freight transportation. The efforts made at the European level toward the formulation of a common, ITS-based freight transportation systems architecture are also reviewed. In this respect, there is a report on work done within project THEMIS.

AB  - The Third Party Logistics (3PT) is a fast-growing industry in recent years and has a demand for information integration technology. More and more logistics companies find other Web service providers to integrate their application in order to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency. Web service meets their requirement. Web services are self-contained, web-enabled applications capable not only of performing business activities on their own, but also possessing the ability to engage other Web services in order to complete higher-order business transactions. As the main functional part of logistics system, freight transportation system assumes the job of scheduling vehicles for the logistics system to complete the transportation task. In this paper a freight transportation system which is separated from the logistics system is a typical business case. The prototype system developed on J2EE has a quality of cross-platform and interoperability with other systems.

Its universities and other higher education institutions have made significant progress in widening access to education. But challenges remain: the Bío Bío Region continues to suffer from brain drain as well as higher than average unemployment and poverty rates. How can the Bío Bío Region promote new business formation and the development of the existing small and medium-sized companies? What incentives are needed to improve higher education institutions’ regional and local orientation? How can higher education institutions move from knowledge generation towards knowledge transfer? This joint OECD and World Bank review explores a range of helpful policy measures and institutional reforms to mobilise higher education for the development of the Bío Bío Region. It is part of the series of the OECD reviews of Higher Education in Regional and City Development. These reviews help mobilise higher education institutions for economic, social and cultural development of cities and regions. They analyse how the higher education system impacts upon regional and local development and bring together universities, other higher education institutions and public and private agencies to identify strategic goals and to work towards them.

AB  - We argue that from an evolutionary perspective memory systems have to be evaluated not in terms of how accurately they reflect the past, but in terms of their contribution to present and future survival and reproduction. Memory systems differ in the degree of flexibility in offering anticipatory behavior. Episodic memory is the most flexible system in that it enables humans to envisage virtually any particular future event. It may have evolved only as a design feature of this anticipation and planning system. Several chapters in this volume discuss animal models of this ability. Here, we warn that there must also be uniquely human traits for which there can be no such animal models and suggest that human mental time travel may be based on several such traits. Animal comparisons may still be extremely important in their own right, and because identification of what is unique about the human capacity and what is shared with other species; may hold decisive clues about how mental time travel is created in the human brain. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract Background: The potential benefits of coordinating infectious disease eradication programs that use campaigns such as supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) should not be over-looked. One example of a coordinated approach is an adaptive “sequential strategy": first, all annual SIA budget is dedicated to the eradication of a single infectious disease; once that disease is eradicated, the annual SIA budget is re-focussed on eradicating a second disease, etc. Herd immunity suggests that a sequential strategy may eradicate several infectious diseases faster than a non-adaptive “simultaneous strategy” of dividing annual budget equally among eradication programs for those diseases. However, mathematical modeling is required to understand the potential extent of this effect. Methods: Our objective was to illustrate how budget allocation strategies can interact with the nonlinear nature of disease transmission to determine time to eradication of several infectious diseases under different budget allocation strategies. Using a mathematical transmission model, we analyzed three hypothetical vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in three different countries. A central decision-maker can distribute funding among SIA programs for these three diseases according to either a sequential strategy or a simultaneous strategy. We explored the time to eradication under these two strategies under a range of scenarios. Results: For a certain range of annual budgets, all three diseases can be eradicated relatively quickly under the sequential strategy, whereas eradication never occurs under the simultaneous strategy. However, moderate changes to total SIA budget, SIA frequency, order of eradication, or funding disruptions can create disproportionately large differences in the time and budget required for eradication under the sequential strategy. We find that the predicted time to eradication can be very sensitive to small differences in the rate of case importation between the countries. We also find that the time to eradication of all three diseases is not necessarily lowest when the least transmissible disease is targeted first. Conclusions: Relatively modest differences in budget allocation strategies in the near-term can result in surprisingly large long-term differences in time required to eradicate, as a result of the amplifying effects of herd immunity and the nonlinearities of disease transmission. More sophisticated versions of such models may be useful to large international donors or other organizations as a planning or portfolio optimization tool, where choices must be made regarding how much funding to dedicate to different infectious disease eradication efforts.

The novelty is the treatment of the capacity restriction, which is not viewed as affecting negatively individual preferences (e.g. probability of a full flight), but does influence aggregate utility. A mode choice model is used to represent unrestricted individual preferences assuming full availability ("phone call" demand); air capacity is treated as a variable that acts on the actual choice set. Restricted choices and total demand stochasticity are integrated in welfare calculations (users' benefits and profits). Numerical examples are given and results are analyzed in terms of load factors fare levels, and sensitivity to the stochasticity of requests.

AB  - In this paper, the authors analyze the trade-off problem between project budgets and critical risks. Project managers face the problem to balance cash flows and risks when preventive risk response plans require additional costs. Mathematical modeling approach is used with a metric called risk-based project value (RPV). RPV is an evaluation of projects calculated with cash flows and risk probabilities of activities that constitute the project network diagram. There exists an optimal solution for the budget allocation problem that maximizes the expected project value. There is a condition where additional budgets can improve the project value. The study result suggests that there should be an integrated process to optimize the budget plan with the risk management plan. Methods are developed to obtain optimum budget allocations for projects with various types of activity networks. Evaluation of the marginal cost sensitivity on the RPV supports project manager's decisions on reallocation of budgets. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

best simulation lengths for all simulation experiments and thus
significantly reduce the total computation cost for a desired confidence

AB  - Cumulative culture denotes the, arguably, human capacity to build on the cultural behaviors of one's predecessors, allowing increases in cultural complexity to occur such that many of our cultural artifacts, products and technologies have progressed beyond what a single individual could invent alone. This process of cumulative cultural evolution underlies human cultural success and has enabled us to reach and inhabit some of the most inhospitable environments on this planet. Why humans, but not other animals, have exhibited a cultural explosion has caused much deliberation. The human propensity to imitate, teach, "mind-read" and cooperate have all featured prominently in accounts of the prerequisites for cumulative culture. However, this may not represent the complete picture. In this article we consider whether there exists a link between future thinking, specifically prospective mental time travel, and the observed distribution of cumulative culture. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

It contains new investments in the railway and subway systems as well as new links in the road system. This paper deals with the issue of appraising this kind of investment program. One major problem is the lack of a unique standard method, and it is argued that several tools should be used in a practical evaluation of large-scale investments in the transportation system. Four different approaches are presented and related to each other. First, one study uses a network-based mode-split/assignment model with a fixed trip matrix. The second study is complementary, as its aim is to also trace the impacts on the spatial distribution of population and jobs by applying an integrated transportation and land use model. Third, the long-run effects of the investments on regional economic growth are discussed within the framework of regional production functions. Fourth, an alternative approach is used, in which benefits from the investments are assessed through their estimated influence on aggregate land values.

AB  - Almost from its inception, Einstein's general theory of relativity was known to sanction spacetime models harboring singularities. Until the 1960s, however, spacetime singularities were thought to be artifacts of the idealizations of the models. This attitude evaporated in the face of a series of theorems, due largely to Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, which showed that Einstein's general theory implies that singularities can be expected to occur in a wide variety of conditions in both gravitational collapse and in cosmology. In the light of these results some physicists adopted the attitude that, since spacetime singularities are intolerable, general relativity contains within itself the seeds of its own destruction. Others hoped that peaceful coexistence with singularities could be achieved by proving a form of Roger Penrose's cosmic censorship hypothesis, which would place singularities safely inside black holes. Whatever the attitude one adopts toward spacetime singularities, it is evident that they raise a number of foundational problems for physics and have profound implications for the philosophy of space and time. However, philosophers of science have been slow to awaken to the significance of these developments. Indeed, this is the first serious book-length study of the subject by a philosopher of science. It features an overview of the literature on singularities, as well as an analytic commentary on their significance to a number of scientific and philosophical issues.

We found that individuals with a higher capacity for visual imagery experienced more visual and other sensory details both when remembering past events and when imagining future events. In addition, individuals who habitually use suppression to regulate their emotions experienced fewer sensory, contextual, and emotional details when representing both past and future events, while the use of reappraisal had no effect on either kind of events.

AB  - Patients with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) are\noften described as having impaired ability for planning and decision\nmaking despite retaining intact capacities for explicit reasoning. The\nsomatic marker hypothesis is that the VMPFC associates implicitly\nrepresented affective information with explicit representations of\nactions or outcomes. Consequently, when the VMPFC is damaged explicit\nreasoning is no longer scaffolded by affective information, leading to\ncharacteristic deficits. These deficits are exemplified in performance\non the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in which subjects with VMPFC perform\nsignificantly worse than neurotypicals in a task which requires them\nlearn from rewarding and punishing experience to make decisions. The\nsomatic marker theory adopts a canonical theory of emotion, in which\nemotions function as part of a valencing system, to explain the role of\naffective processes. The first part of the paper argues against this\ncanonical account. The second part provides a different account of the\nrole of the role of the VMPFC in decision-making which does not depend\non the canonical account of emotion. Together the first and second parts\nof the paper provide the basis for a different interpretation of results\non the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). In fact the IGT may be probing a\ndeficit in what has been called mental time travel: the ability to\naccess and use information from previous experience and imaginatively\nrehearse future experiences as part of the process of deliberation.

AB  - A network flow model is used for budget allocation in a multi-campus institution over several years. The network had a hierarchical structure with three hierarchies. The network's lower bounds represent the minimal requirements for each component. The upper bounds represent the predicted future requirement. They are predicted via a cost simulation model where several volume indices, policy variables and some environmental factors are used. Thus the overall planning process combines simulation with optimization. The model maximizes the additive utility function of the institution, expressed as a weighted summation over the preferences of the three hierarchies. The preferences are evaluated by using a multi-goal approach, utilizing pairwise comparisons and the eigenvalue prioritization technique developed by T. Saaty. INTRODUCTION

In this article I propose that inquirers must choose an inquiry paradigm that is resonant with the values they wish to promote in the conduct of educational inquiry. I defend this modest proposal by examining the values expressed in inquiry paradigms and explain how one chooses an inquiry paradigm to achieve a state of value fit.

AB  - Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the cognitive control of response related action. A frontocentral negative ERP-component, the N2, which probably originates from the ACC, is usually enhanced in conflict-trials that demand an unexpected response. We here used stepped adjustment of response expectation in a response-cueing task, and measured how the N2 varied with global and local cue validity. Results showed that, irrespective of the current cue validity, response times, error rates, and the frontocentral components P2, N2 and P3 increased in unexpected trials. Nevertheless, a N2 was also seen in expected trials, and its latency correlated positively with reaction times, indicating that this potential does not express response conflict only. In line with roles suggested for the ACC, we here propose that the N2 is related to the process of response selection which influences subsequent processing stages reflected in the P3. Unexpected revisions of response programs enhance and delay the N2. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin-destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin-destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A proposed set of aviation system performance measures that have been defined to support multimodal transportation planning in California is presented. As part of the 1998 update of the California Transportation Plan (CTP), the California Department of Transportation has defined a framework of system performance measures that could be applied on a multimodal basis to assess the performance of the transportation system, support informed decision making, and establish a coordinated and consistent process for performance measurement throughout the state. The research that is described examined approaches to measuring the performance of the aviation system that have been adopted at a national level and in other states, as well as general principles for measurement of transportation system performance that emerged from a conference held in 1997 as part of the CTP update process. The range of considerations that arise in measuring the performance of the aviation system is discussed, and potential performance measures that have been proposed to address the requirements of the CTP framework are identified. Finally, issues that will need to be addressed in implementing any comprehensive set of performance measures for the aviation component of the transportation system are discussed.

AB  -  Having not considered such aspects as spatial distribution features of transportation networks and resident areas, the spatial influence of outside transportation modes on the features within the research regions as well as the different transit capacity of different transportation ways, the conventional measuring methods based on path analysis and network analysis are deficient to the description of regional transportation situation. With the employment and optimization of the connectivity and accessibility of the network nodes to evaluate transportation network, this study successfully breaks through the limitation of the border of investigative area and, different transportation modes can also be taken into account. Based on the gradually increased correlation coefficient between the connectivity change, which is a gradually increased process from direct connections to indirect multi-steps connections, and the development of regional economy, this paper proposes economy-network diameter index (ENDI), which is employed to evaluate the development of network and the contribution to regional economy of Gansu Province, China with the data of 2002 transportation network and the economic statistics in the Statistical Yearbook. By above methods, this empirical study comes to the following conclusions: 1) interregional transportation contributes more to the development of regional economic than that of the adjoining transportation; and 2) these indices can be used to designate spatial interactional scopes of regional economy, and accordingly to provide powerful and scientific supports for the planning of regional transportation and economy; and 3) the accessibility figure of network nodes shows that transportation of Gansu Province takes on a phenomenon of high cluster and spatial autocorrelation; and 4) ENDI can also be used to create spatial weight matrix of spatial progress. As calculation of these indices is laborious, several efficient computational methods are developed.

Episodic memory shares a core neural network with the simulation of future episodes, enabling mental time travel into both the past and the future. The notion that there might be something distinctly human about mental time travel has provoked ingenious attempts to demonstrate episodic memory or future simulation in non-human animals, but we argue that they have not yet established a capacity comparable to the human faculty. The evolution of the capacity to simulate possible future events, based on episodic memory, enhanced fitness by enabling action in preparation of different possible scenarios that increased present or future survival and reproduction chances. Human language may have evolved in the first instance for the sharing of past and planned future events, and, indeed, fictional ones, further enhancing fitness in social settings.

AB  - Remembering the past and envisioning the future rely on episodic memory which enables mental time travel. Studies in young adults indicate that past and future thinking share common cognitive and neural underpinnings. No imaging data is yet available in healthy aged subjects. Using fMRI, we scanned older subjects while they remembered personal events (PP: last 12. months) or envisioned future plans (FP: next 12. months). Behaviorally, both time-periods were comparable in terms of visual search strategy, emotion, frequency of rehearsal and recency of the last evocation. However, PP were more episodic, engaged a higher state of autonoetic consciousness and mental visual images were clearer and more numerous than FP. Neuroimaging results revealed a common network of activation (posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus) reflecting the use of similar cognitive processes. Furthermore, the episodic nature of PP depended on hippocampal and visuo-spatial activations (occipital and angular gyri), while, for FP, it depended on the inferior frontal and lateral temporal gyri, involved in semantic memory retrieval. The common neural network and behavior suggests that healthy aged subjects thought about their future prospects in the past. The contribution of retrospective thinking into the future that engages the same network as the one recruited when remembering the past is discussed. Within this network, differential recruitment of specific areas highlights the episodic distinction between past and future mental time travel. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Consider a one-warehouse multi-retailer system under constant and deterministic demand, which is subjected to transportation capacity for every delivery period. To search for the best stationary zero inventory ordering (ZIO) policy, or the best power-of-two policy, or the best nested policy, the problem is formulated as a 0-1 integer linear program in which the objective function comprises of a fixed transportation cost whenever a delivery is made and the inventory costs for both the warehouse and retailers. To overcome the transportation capacity limitation, we extend the policies to allow for staggering deliveries. It is shown that with transportation capacity constraint the non-staggering policy can have its effectiveness close to 0% from the best staggering policy and the power-of-two policy with staggering allowed can have its effectiveness close to 0% from the optimal policy. Nevertheless in general, the power-of-two policy fairs well on a number of randomly generated problems. To solve the large distribution network problem, an efficient heuristic based on the power-of-two policy with staggering of deliveries is suggested. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - J. Benhabib and R. E. A. Farmer (1994, J. Econ. Theory 63, 19?41) showed that a single sector growth model in the presence of increasing returns-to-scale may display an indeterminate equilibrium if the demand and supply curves cross with the "wrong slopes." We generalize their result to a model with preferences that are non- separable in consumption and leisure. We provide a simple analog of the Benhabib? Farmer condition that works in the non-separable case. Our condition is easy to check in practice and it allows for equilibria to be indeterminate, even when demand and supply curves have the standard slopes. We illustrate that equilibrium can be indeterminate when demand and supply curves have standard slopes and the degree of increasing returns-to-scale is well within recent estimates by S. Basu and J. Fernald (1997, J. Polit. Econ. 105, 249?283) for U. S. manufacturing.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - This article contains the argument that the human ability to travel mentally in time constitutes a discontinuity between ourselves and other animals. Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. It is not an isolated module, but depends on the sophistication of other cognitive capacities, including self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception-knowledge relationship, and the ability to dissociate imagined mental states from one's present mental state. These capacities are also important aspects of so-called theory of mind, and they appear to mature in children at around age 4. Furthermore, mental time travel is generative, involving the combination and recombination of familiar elements, and in this respect may have been a precursor to language. Current evidence, although indirect or based on anecdote rather than on systematic study, suggests that nonhuman animals, including the great apes, are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. In contrast, mental time travel by humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning. Past and future events loom large in much of human thinking, giving rise to cultural, religious, and scientific concepts about origins, destiny, and time itself. References: 190

AB  - A bilevel formulation is developed to identify vulnerable transportation\nnetwork links. The problem can be viewed as a game between an ``evil\nentity{''} and the traffic management agency. At the lower level, the\ntraffic management agency routes vehicles according to the system of\noptimal traffic assignment. At the upper level, the evil entity seeks to\nmaximize disruption to the network. A key component of this formulation\nis the vulnerability index, which is a measure of the importance of a\nspecific link to the connectivity of an origin-destination pair. The\nvulnerability index accounts for the availability of alternate paths,\nexcess capacity, and travel time. The vulnerability indices are\naggregated across all origin-destination pairs into the disruption\nindex. This disruption index is the measure of damage to the network by\nwhich the evil entity might rank links as targets. Because the evil\nentity has a limited amount of resources, it cannot strike all of the\npotential targets and must choose among subsets of links. Four cases\nwith different types of information availability for the evil entity and\nthe traffic management agency are examined for a simple network. In each\ncase, the evil entity is assumed to aim its strike at the link that has\nthe potential to carry traffic for the most origin-destination pairs.

AB  - Humans have the unique capacity to mentally travel through time, that is, to reflect on the past, anticipate the future, and con- struct alternate realities in their minds. The ability to mentally travel through time affects a variety of social psychological topics. Representations of events can differ considerably, depending on the event’s temporal location and distance from the present. Current emotions may be influenced by thoughts of future and past times (e.g., nostalgia, hope). Judgments about future events and actions are an important aspect of everyday functioning (e.g., predictions). Indeed, hypothetical thought about counterfac- tual events that might never come to pass may change the perception and evaluation of present reality. Despite this varied and extensive influence of time on affect, judgment, perception, and behavior, these diverse topics have not been brought together under one common roof. In this overview article and in the special issue on Mental Time Travel, we aim to identify key themes of mental time travel research, point to communalities and differences, and help to integrate various aspects of mental time travel research.

AB  - Time-travel text search enriches standard text search by temporal predicates, so that users of web archives can easily retrieve document versions that are considered relevant to a given keyword query and existed during a given time interval. Different index structures have been proposed to efficiently support time-travel text search. None of them, however, can easily be updated as the Web evolves and new document versions are added to the web archive. In this work, we describe a novel index structure that efficiently supports time-travel text search and can be main- tained incrementally as new document versions are added to the web archive. Our solution uses a sharded index organiza- tion, bounds the number of spuriously read index entries per shard, and can be maintained using small in-memory buffers and append-only operations. We present experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrating that main- taining our novel index structure is an order of magnitude more efficient than periodically rebuilding one of the existing index structures, while query-processing performance is not adversely affected.

AB  - "Stochastic simulation optimization" (often shortened as simulation optimization) refers to stochastic optimization using simulation. Specifically, the underlying problem is stochastic and the goal is to find the values of controllable parameters (decision variables) to optimize some performance measures of interest, which are evaluated via stochastic simulation, such as discrete-event simulation or Monte Carlo simulation. In summary, the requirement of multiple replications for each design alternative is a critical concern for efficiency of stochastic simulation optimization. This concern becomes especially pronounced when the cost of simulation or sampling is not cheap. This book tries to answer the question "what is an optimal (or the most efficient) way to conduct all the simulations in order to find a good or optimal solution (design)?" The goal is to minimize the total simulation budget while achieving a desired optimality level.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of determining optimal paths for routing an undesirable vehicle on a network embedded on an Euclidean plane. A typical application is the transporting of hazardous materials. Demand points, or population centers, are discretely distributed at nodes and continuously distributed on straight-line links of the network. The objective is to find, without incorporating the probability of accidental leakage of hazardous material, a path that minimizes the weighted sum of lengths over which this vehicle is within a threshold distance λ of population centers. By appropriately redefining link lengths, we can use a shortest-path algorithm to solve the problem. Special properties of the objective function allow us to efficiently calculate the modified link lengths. We discuss the properties of the optimal routing strategy and the objective value, and offer an economic interpretation of the case when λ varies. Operating within the framework of risk analysis, we integrate the probability of accidental release of hazardous material into our basic model. The routing objective becomes the minimization of expected damage, where accidental leakage of hazardous materials can inflict damage within a neighborhood λ of the accident site. We also discuss our computational experience in using the model.

AB  - Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the cognitive control of response related action. A frontocentral negative ERP-component, the N2, which probably originates from the ACC, is usually enhanced in conflict-trials that demand an unexpected response. We here used stepped adjustment of response expectation in a response-cueing task, and measured how the N2 varied with global and local cue validity. Results showed that, irrespective of the current cue validity, response times, error rates, and the frontocentral components P2, N2 and P3 increased in unexpected trials. Nevertheless, a N2 was also seen in expected trials, and its latency correlated positively with reaction times, indicating that this potential does not express response conflict only. In line with roles suggested for the ACC, we here propose that the N2 is related to the process of response selection which influences subsequent processing stages reflected in the P3. Unexpected revisions of response programs enhance and delay the N2.

AB  - Many approaches had been proposed for travel time prediction in these decades; most of them focus on the predicting the travel time on freeway or simple arterial network. Travel time prediction for urban network in real time is hard to achieve for several reasons: complexity and path routing problem in urban network, unavailability of real-time sensor data, spatiotemporal data coverage problem, and lacking real-time events consideration. In this paper, we propose a knowledge based real-time travel time prediction model which contains real-time and historical travel time predictors to discover traffic patterns from the raw data of location based services by data mining technique and transform them to travel time prediction rules. Besides, dynamic weight combination of the two predictors by meta-rules is proposed to provide a real-time traffic event response mechanism to enhance the precision of the travel time prediction.

AB  - Mechanisms for allocation of one or many goods to a number of agents are proposed in this paper. The goal is to propose mechanisms in a general setting where the goods might be divisible or indivisible. A mechanism in the Groves class that is dominant strategy incentive compatible and almost budget balanced is obtained. In the case of one or more indivisible goods, the proposed mechanisms fall back to the mechanisms proposed independently by Moulin and by Guo &amp;amp; Conitzer. The proposed mechanisms are characterised by a linear redistribution or rebate function included in the payments. The proposed worst case optimal mechanism minimises the worst case ratio of budget surplus to efficient surplus. An optimal-in-expectation mechanism that minimizes the ratio of expected budget surplus to expected efficient surplus is also proposed and compared with the worst case optimal mechanism. Numerical solutions for the coefficients of linear rebate function, worst case efficiency loss, and expected efficiency loss are obtained. An example motivating the extension to the divisible case is resource allocation in the uplink of a wireless communication system. This is briefly discussed.

AB  - The term ‘sustainable transportation development’ is a combination of sustainable development and transportation. As a concept, it involves the application of the sustainable development idea to transportation systems. This paper deals with how the concept of sustainability is currently used and how it should be used in the future engineering of transportation systems. First, the current definitions of sustainable development are reviewed and it is shown that there is a need for definition and criteria that can be used by engineers for planning, design and operation of transportation systems. Second, the current approaches of sustainability in transportation planning are reviewed and discussed. Subsequently, it is proposed that the focus should be on a sustainably developed transportation system, i.e. a system that meets the people’s needs, with the available or affordable environmental, financial and social resources. Finally, it is shown that a sustainably developed transportation problem is basically a mathematical problem. Keywords Sustainable development, transportation engineering, optimisation problem Introduction There appears to be a consensus of opinion that the current pattern of transportation growth is not desirable. The reader will agree that the rate of the world’s motor vehicle fleet growth, in the developed as well as in the developing world, is threatening our human, social and economic well being. Quality of life, levels of basic freedom, health, education, access to – and distribution of – resources, etc.are in danger. Reasons for this are inter alia the environmental and safety impacts of transportation, and the dependence of land uses on the financial resources for construction and maintenance of its associated infrastructure both in the short- and long-term. Sustainable development has been the topic of many conferences and activities by transportation professionals and international agencies. Despite the attention given, the concept still lacks clarity for certain groups of stakeholders, for example transportation engineers and planners. This paper deals with how the sustainability concept is currently used in transportation engineering and planning, and how it should be rationalised in the future for the planning, design and operation of transportation systems.

AB  - Non-human primates (NHP) are essential translational models for biomedical research. Dendritic cells (DC) are a group of antigen presenting cells that play pivotal roles in the immunobiology of health and disease and are attractive cells for adoptive immunotherapy to stimulate and suppress immunity. DC have been studied extensively in humans and mice but until recently, have not been well characterized in NHP. This review considers the available data about DC across a range of NHP species and summarizes the understanding of in vitro-propagated DC and in vivo-isolated DC, which is now established. It is clear that although NHP DC exist within the paradigm of human DC, there are important functional and phenotypic differences when compared with human DC subsets. These differences need to be taken into account when designing preclinical, translational studies of DC therapy using NHP models.

Using such estimates, we compare the incumbent member states' predicted budget receipts before and after eastern enlargement and examine the impact of different voting rules in EU-27. According to our estimates eastern enlargement has large effects on the budget receipts of the incumbent member states. Moreover, whether the voting rules are based on the Nice Treaty or the Constitutional Treaty makes a difference for most member states. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - The objective of this article is to analyse the way in which budget allocation decisions have been made in the National Health Service (NHS) of Britain. Despite the criticisms of the pre-1948 health care system on the grounds of geographical inequity, it was not until nearly twenty-five years after the service's inception that explicit allocation formulae were devised and implemented in an attempt to achieve equity, defined as equal financial resources for health care for those in equal need. The article is divided into four sections; the first analyses briefly the establishment of the NHS in 1948 and the failure of policy-makers to rectify the significant inequalities in the distribution of health care inputs between the regions. The second section is concerned with the official recognition of the policy problem of geographical inequality in resources and the first attempt to rectify it. In the third section the most recent set of resource allocation formulae for England, Scotland and Wales will be analysed and compared. The final section offers some brief conclusions.

AB  - This paper presents a multi-modal freight transportation model based on a digitized geographic network. A systematic analysis and decomposition of all the transport operations, i.e. moving, loading and unloading, transshipping and transiting, leads to the development of a virtual network where each virtual link corresponds to a specific operation, and all transportation modes and means are inter-linked. Software, called NODUS, automatically generates the virtual network so that the model can be conveniently applied to large networks. The analytical structure of the links notation makes it easy to attach specific cost functions to each virtual link. The model is applied to the trans-European freight network of roads, railways and inland waterways for the transportation of wood. Cost functions are built up for each operation by each mode/means combination. A detailed point-to-point origin-destination matrix, calibrated on Eurostat statistics, is generated by a Monte-Carlo technique. Then, the total transportation cost is minimized with respect to the choices of routes, modes and means. This provides estimations of transportation services demands as well as modal splits, to the extent that the two hypotheses of demand based on generalized cost minimization and market contestability are accepted. A sensitivity analysis on the relative road cost is made, which provides measures of arc-elasticities. Copyright ?? 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The alpha 2 agonist clonidine has been shown to be anxiolytic in a number of preclinical anxiety models. Interestingly, intravenous infusion of the alpha 2 antagonists idazoxan at 10 mg/kg and rauwolscine at 2.24 mg/kg significantly disinhibited lick-shock conflict responding in rats similar to the alpha 2 agonist clonidine (0.022 mg/kg) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (0.5 mg/kg). However, the alpha 2 antagonists yohimbine and piperoxan, the alpha 2 agonists medetomidine, guanfacine, and guanabenz, the non-specific alpha antagonist phentolamine, and the alpha 1 antagonist prazosin did not disinhibit conflict responding in the Vogel lick-shock paradigm. In fact, yohimbine has been shown to be anxiogenic in both animals and man. This may be due to yohimbine's lack of specificity and its ability to inhibit GABAergic release. In addition, all of these agents, except idazoxan, did not increase water consumption in water deprived rats. Idazoxan (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased water consumption by 45%. Therefore, idazoxan increased conflict responding for water reward at a dose (10 mg/kg) which also decreased water consumption in a non-conflict paradigm. These data suggest that agents with selective antagonism at the alpha 2 receptor site may be anxiolytic while agents with less specificity at this site such as yohimbine, piperoxan, and phentolamine are not anxiolytic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Morphine is the most used compound among narcotic analgesics. Apart from its presence in the poppy plant, morphine has been shown to be endogenously present in different tissues of mammals and lower animals. MATERIAL/METHODS: The presence of endogenous morphine and codeine was investigated by Gas Chromatography/ Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) in the brain of non human primate. The release of endogenous morphine from monkey brain slices was studied in vitro in the presence of high potassium concentrations with and without calcium in the medium. RESULTS: Endogenous morphine, and its direct precursor codeine, was for the first time detected by GC/MS in the brain of non human primate. High potassium concentrations depolarized neurons releasing endogenous morphine twofold above basal line levels in a calcium dependent mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This finding confirms the presence of the endogenous alkaloid throughout the phylogenesis of the nerve system of mammals and lower animals and indicates that endogenous morphine might function as a neuromodulator/neurotransmitter agent in the central nervous system (CNS) of non human primates.

AB  - Although many of the problems that Cali is experiencing - social and human capital deterioration, a declining economy, and institutional crisis - are a reflection of Colombia ' s complicated socioeconomic situation, the city has been hit harder by the crisis than other large cities, as confirmed by the following indicators: GDP, unemployment, poverty rate, inequality, and number of homicides. According to recent estimates, the population in Cali reached the 2 million level in 1999, making the city the second largest in the country after Bogota. Internal migration increased significantly during the early 90s due to the economic boom generated by drug dealing activities, and continued in the last part of the decade, due to resettlement movements of large population groups, affected by social conflict in rural areas. However, migration flows have generated social tension in the city, as economic opportunities became scarce. The Bank engaged in a participatory process to produce a City Development Strategy (CDS), whose specific objectives are to help the city administration and stakeholders identify a strategy to overcome the current crisis, and, be a neutral facilitator in the reconstruction process. The CDS is being developed in four stages: 1) identification of the main problems; 2) development of the analytical framework; 3) dissemination of results; and, 4) development of a financial plan.

AB  - In the first part of this paper, the framework of the Dutch Integral Transportation Study is given. and the position of the defining of the road network is pointed out. In the second part, the transport network optimization problem is stated formally and the algorithm devised to solve this problem is described. The problem is formed by the minimization of the total costs (investments and users costs) for the transport of a given tripmatrix by choice of the dimensions and flows of the links of a transport network. The solution method has been devised especially in order to overcome the computational dificulties at large networks. It gives a reasonable solution in a relatively very short computation time. To that end the problem is decomposed into a number of sub-problems. yielding the optimal relationship between the dimension and the traffic flow for each link. and a master problem assigning the flows to the network in such a way that the objective function is minimized. In the third part the application of this method to the optimization of the Dutch road network is described.

AB  - Allocation of public money in New Zealand is increasingly requiring justification on efficiency grounds. A limited budget for control of the introduced possum forces difficult choices to be made about where to control possums. Such choices have traditionally been made on 'scientific' criteria, which may not meet efficiency requirements. Willingness to pay for possum control at a specific location is evaluated using dichotomous choice contingent valuation applied by way of a postal survey. Willingness to pay is found to be a function of perceptions of site characteristics, some of which are different from the scientific criteria, and of socio-economic characteristics. These findings indicate that the current budget allocation method is inefficient. A new approach to cost-effective allocation of possum-control budgets, which allows simple incorporation of public preferences, is proposed.

AB  - Examines sociological contributions to understandings of racial/ethnic conflicts. The history of sociology as the scientific study of systematic patterns of relations among persons & groups is traced, highlighting central points of agreement between classical & contemporary sociologists. Sociological definitions of race & ethnicity are presented, along with the related concepts of racism & ethnocentrism. It is maintained that sociological theories are built on conflict, interaction, & consensus. Although no single theoretical orientation dominates the field, conflict theories focusing on shifting patterns of domination & exploitation overshadow the others in research on race/ethnicity. The distinction between micro- & macrodimensions of sociological analysis is examined, along with various quantitative & qualitative methodologies. It is suggested that the primary issues of interest to sociologists addressing race/ethnicity are race vs class, social policy/affirmative action, & pluralism/multiculturalism; coming to terms with developments in these areas will be the primary focus in the future. 49 References.

AB  - Many scientific applications are described through\nworkflow structures.

The current work\naddresses the problem of resource allocation for\nnon-deterministic workflows under budget\nconstraints. We present a way of transforming the\ninitial problem into sub-problems that have been\nstudied before.

AB  -  A framework is presented which may be used to analyze and evaluate intermodal networks. An intermodal network may be defined as an integrated transportation system consisting of two or more modes. Modes on intermodal networks are connected through facilities which allow travelers and/or freight to transfer from one mode to another during a trip from an origin to a destination. Network equilibrium models may be used in the transportation planning field to make predictions regarding future network activity in terms of traffic volumes and travel costs, to evaluate alternative policies and to aid the decision making process in terms of future transportation plans. To expedite and facilitate the effort of detailed intermodal network representation and analysis, a network equilibrium model is interfaced with a geographic information system (GIS). This interface takes advantage of new technologies and sources of information on the physical components of the network. It allows the user to store the results of the proposed models in a GIS environment and display them in a spatial data format.

AB  - Current models of autobiographical memory suggest that self-identity guides autobiographical memory retrieval. Further, the capacity to recall the past and imagine one's self in the future (mental time travel) can influence social problem solving. We examined whether manipulating self-identity, through an induction task in which students were led to believe they possessed high or low self-efficacy, impacted episodic specificity and content of retrieved and imagined events, as well as social problem solving. Compared to individuals in the low self efficacy group, individuals in the high self efficacy group generated past and future events with greater (a) specificity, (b) positive words, and (c) self-efficacious statements, and also performed better on social problem solving indices. A lack of episodic detail for future events predicted poorer performance on social problem solving tasks. Strategies that increase perceived self-efficacy may help individuals to selectively construct a past and future that aids in negotiating social problems. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Autobiographical memories in our lives are critically dependent on temporal lobe structures. However, the contribution of CA1 neurons in the human hippocampus to the retrieval of episodic autobiographical memory remains elusive. In patients with a rare acute transient global amnesia, highly focal lesions confined to the CA1 field of the hippocampus can be detected on MRI. We studied the effect of these lesions on autobiographical memory using a detailed autobiographical interview including the remember/know procedure. In 14 of 16 patients, focal lesions in the CA1 sector of the hippocampal cornu ammonis were detected. Autobiographical memory was significantly affected over all time periods, including memory for remote periods. Impairment of episodic memory and autonoetic consciousness exhibited a strong temporal gradient extending 30 to 40 y into the past. These results highlight the distinct and critical role of human hippocampal CA1 neurons in autobiographical memory retrieval and for re-experiencing detailed episodic memories.

AB  - Ag-specific T cell activation requires a CD28-mediated costimulatory interaction. This observation has suggested novel approaches to suppress donor-specific immunity, including the use of soluble CD28 antagonists, such as CTLA4Ig, which suppresses transplant rejection in small animal models. In this study, CTLA4Ig therapy was examined in a non-human primate model of allogeneic pancreatic islet transplantation. Two of five CTLA4Ig-treated monkeys showed prolonged graft survival, which correlated with donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in vitro. Humoral responses to the transplanted tissue were suppressed in all treated animals. These results suggest that CTLA4Ig is effective in suppressing both humoral and cellular immune responses in a non-human primate model of allogeneic transplantation.

AB  - Polyomaviruses have so far only been isolated from mammals and birds. Typical for all members of this family is their double-stranded genome of approximately 5000 base-pairs which can be divided into an early region encoding at least two functional proteins, the large and small tumor antigens, and a late region encompassing genes for the capsid proteins VP1 and VP2. During the last 10. years several novel polyomaviruses have been described in non-human primates and man. This review compares the non-human primate polyomavirus genomes that have been completely sequenced with each other and with the genomes of human polyomaviruses. We predict the presence of protein- and microRNA-encoding sequences. Our analyses demonstrate that several genetically distinct groups of non-human primate polyomaviruses exist, that different polyomaviruses can infect the same non-human primate species but that most of their proteins display highly similar domains and motifs, indicating conservation of key functions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Situated Nature of Preschool Children's Conflict Strategies Author: Robert Thornberg Abstract The purpose of this study was to examine whether the peer conflict strategies of preschool children are situated and therefore vary across different conflict situations. Hypothetical conflict interviews were administered through a series of puppet shows. Participants were 178 preschool children. Results indicate that preschool children's conflict management skills are situated in peer conflict, because their strategies are to a greater or lesser degree influenced by the opponent's strategies. When the opponent's conflict strategy is non-aggressive, aggressive conflict strategies are atypical and low in frequency. When the opponent behaves with physical aggression in the conflict situation, most of the subjects respond to this aggressive conflict strategy with physical aggression. The findings confirm neither a static individual view nor a situated determinism, but a situated action view in which both individuals' cognitions and distributed cognitions interact.

AB  - We investigate the issue of implementation via individually rational ex-post budget-balanced Bayesian mechanisms. We show that all decision rules generating a nonnegative expected social surplus are implementable via such mechanisms if and only if the probability distribution of the agents' type profiles satisfies two conditions: the well-known condition of Cr??mer and McLean [1988. Full extraction of the surplus in Bayesian and dominant strategy auctions, Econometrica 56, 1247-1257] and the Identifiability condition introduced in this paper. We also show that these conditions are necessary for ex-post efficiency to be attainable with budget balance and individual rationality, and that the expected social surplus in these mechanisms can be distributed in any desirable way. Lastly, we demonstrate that, like Cr??mer-McLean condition, the Identifiability condition is generic if there are at least three agents. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Stochastic simulation optimization" (often shortened as simulation optimization) refers to stochastic optimization using simulation. Specifically, the underlying problem is stochastic and the goal is to find the values of controllable parameters (decision variables) to optimize some performance measures of interest, which are evaluated via stochastic simulation, such as discrete-event simulation or Monte Carlo simulation. In summary, the requirement of multiple replications for each design alternative is a critical concern for efficiency of stochastic simulation optimization. This concern becomes especially pronounced when the cost of simulation or sampling is not cheap. This book tries to answer the question "what is an optimal (or the most efficient) way to conduct all the simulations in order to find a good or optimal solution (design)?" The goal is to minimize the total simulation budget while achieving a desired optimality level.

AB  - In an independent private value auction environment, we are interested in strategy-proof mechanisms that maximize the agents' residual surplus, that is, the utility derived from the physical allocation minus transfers accruing to an external entity. We find that, under the assumption of an increasing hazard rate of type distributions, an optimal deterministic mechanism never extracts any net payments from the agents, \ie it will be budget-balanced. Specifically, optimal mechanisms have a simple ``posted price'' or ``option'' form. In the bilateral trade environment, we obtain optimality of posted price mechanisms without any assumption on type distributions, thereby providing a rationale for confining attention to budget-balanced mechanisms.

One challenge to the application of such model in practice is how to deal with asymmetric information. In this paper, we discuss several issues that are often asked by the practitioners that are related to dealing with asymmetric information. Among them are (1) how accurate of the estimated model used by the firm is good enough in the absence of other firms' strategy information; and (2) what the indicators are that currently used model becomes outdated.

AT II was found to cause substantial reduction of the number of punished responses (biphasically and dose-dependently: the lower dose (0.1 microgram) and the high dose (5 micrograms) have a stronger effect than the moderate doses), which implies a proconflict or anxiomimetic effect. At the same time AT II (1 microgram) caused a substantial reduction of the dopamine level in the hypothalamus and hippocampus. The explanation of the AT II-induced changes in the conflict behaviour (anxiogenic action) is sought in its interaction with the AT II receptors (binding sites) in the brain structures (hypothalamus, hippocampus, etc.), participating in that behaviour, as well as in its modulating effect on the DA-ergic transmission in these structures.

AB  - Research on autobiographical remembering has shown the intertwined relationship between the self and memory. Very little is known about the role of the self in the anticipation of the future. To investigate the association, European American (N=61) and Chinese (N=60) college students each reported two past autobiographical events and anticipated two future events, and described themselves in the past, present, and future. The results from a content analysis found that, regardless of culture, the future self and events were more positive and socially oriented than the past self and events. In general, European Americans provided more positive events and self-descriptions than Chinese. Men showed more personal focus in both experiences and self-descriptions than women at all time epochs. Importantly, independent of culture and gender, the self rather than the past events predicted the valence and personal focus of future events. These findings offer new insights into the dynamic relations between the self and episodic thinking.

AB  - Successful biodiversity conservation within the complex and changing landscapes of Europe and beyond requires consideration not only of ecological factors but also of socioeconomic issues. Biodiversity conflict management, the implementation of participatory processes and an understanding of the social consequences of such practices are necessary for effective conservation management. The aim of this report was to explore the roles specifically of conflict management, participation, social learning and attitudes and their potential linkages in biodiversity conservation management. This report is one of three that contributes to the provision, through interdisciplinary teams, of the practical implementation of conservation policies and actions within the EU project ALTERNET Work Package R4. Biodiversity conflicts can be variously defined but were taken here to mean fundamental differences amongst parties concerning values and behaviour as they relate to the environment. Such conflicts are often multilayered, occur at different spatial and temporal scales, can be initiated by diverse drivers and involve a range of stakeholders. In most management contexts, emerged conflicts are identified and managed. A number of potential biodiversity conflict management strategies exist. This is essentially a practical field that draws on tools from many disciplines, including participation and stakeholder engagement. However, an alternative strategy would be to focus more broadly on relationship building and development of common understanding to avoid or reduce conflicts. The shift in biodiversity conservation from a protectionist form of preservation towards one of sustainable utilisation has included an emphasis on the need for participation in conservation management. The rationale is that citizens of our contemporary democratic society will feel responsible for realisation of conservation goals if they are involved in their interpretation and implementation, and that deliberative decision making can assist when peoples' livelihoods are influenced by conservation actions. Participation has been debated in different academic fields for centuries but in practice, different interpretations and institutional and social barriers can make it difficult to implement. There is a continuum, or ladder, described of participation practices. Whilst participation can be defined as a horizontal component of contemporary liberal democracy, there are still important philosophical debates such as those on liberty versus equality, self interest versus common interest and so on. In order to overcome barriers, it was suggested that managers assess a particular context in a framework allowing them to define the theme, purpose of ALTERNet R4: Conflict management, participation, social learning and attitudes in biodiversity conservation participation, stakeholders involved and extent of inclusion and homogeneity of response, political and resource process restrictions and evaluation. Social learning occurs when people engage and share perspectives in order to develop a common framework for action - as in a participatory process. The concept of social learning has both a cognitive and normative dimension and it can be seen as both a process and an outcome. Whilst social learning concentrates on processes and social change, social capital refers to building blocks of social relations. The study of social learning can help analyse social interactions, for example in participatory or decision making processes or large scale policy processes. However, whilst social learning can be a result of participatory processes and contribute to conflict reconciliation, it may not be sufficient to alter peoples' behaviour with respect to conservation. An understanding of attitudes as antecedents of behaviour is important to realise the complexities of altering practices in relation to the environment. One relevant social psychological theory is the Theory of Planned Behaviour which postulates that behavioural intentions are influenced by attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control. Attitudes consist of both cognitive (beliefs and knowledge) and emotional (influenced by values) elements. There are several approaches to understand what causes attitude change. The theory of cognitive dissonance holds that people are motivated to hold attitudes that are consonant with others; hence social learning processes have to take into account initial attitudes. The theory of psychological reactance holds that people may react strongly to perceived limitations of freedom; hence they may reject convincing arguments because they are presented in a onesided, extreme, emotional or untrustworthy manner. Learning processes may thus not always alter behaviour and reduce conflict. It is often difficult to measure the weak linkages between elements of these models and predict how attitudes can be changed and behaviour altered in favour of conservation. Whilst these individual social factors have been well studied, there have been few attempts to link them. A holistic perspective was thus explored in this report, and a mental map to illustrate potential linkages between conflict management, participation, social learning and attitudes was drawn. The complexity of feedback loops and impacts of additional external factors were highlighted. It was concluded that biodiversity conservation management will be more effective if it is implemented with the recognition of the needs of contemporary democratic societies and with an understanding of the ways in which people interact, develop and change. This approach requires not only the use of tools borrowed from ALTERNet R4: Conflict management, participation, social learning and attitudes in biodiversity conservation social science fields but also an appreciation of the theories underpinning the fields concerned. Increased dialogue between natural and social scientists and conservation managers is required to achieve this goal. Recommendations were made for future research directions to further assist in achieving this goal.

Adaptive immunity, as measured by the generation of primary IgM antibody responses to the T-dependent antigen keyhold limpet hemocyanin, was suppressed following chronic (greater than 1 day), but not acute (less than 1 day), stress periods while the IgM response to the T-independent antigen polyvinylpyrrolidone was not affected. In vitro proliferative responses of splenocytes to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A and the B cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide were unaffected. Acute (less than 1 day) stress dramatically increased innate immunity as measured by a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay of phagocytic cell function. DBA/2J mice averaged a 269% increase in phagocytosis as compared to a 412% increase in C57BL/6J. This differential effect of stress on immune responsiveness indicates that alterations in innate immunity in addition to adaptive immunity should also be considered when evaluating neuroendocrine and immune interactions in response to stress.

AB  - Deficits in episodic memory are associated with deficits in the ability to imagine future experiences (i.e., mental time travel). We show that K.C., a person with episodic amnesia and an inability to imagine future experiences, nonetheless systematically discounts the value of future rewards, and his discounting is within the range of controls in terms of both rate and consistency. Because K.C. is neither able to imagine personal uses for the rewards nor provide a rationale for selecting larger future rewards over smaller current rewards, this study demonstrates a dissociation between imagining and making decisions involving the future. Thus, although those capable of mental time travel may use it in making decisions about future rewards, these results demonstrate that it is not required for such decisions.

Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. Mental time travel depends on the sophistication of self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception-knowledge relationship, and the ability to dissociate imagined mental states from one's present mental state. Research suggests that nonhuman animals are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. Mental time travel in humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning.

Mental time travel in humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning.

AB  - In modern marketing, the consumer satisfaction determines the company's long-run success. In the case of marketing of services, like insurance, consumer satisfaction has numerous dimensions, and is, therefore, a complex phenomenon. Based on a study conducted to examine the corporate and public systems for redressing insurance consumers' grievances, this paper seeks to report the findings pertaining to the company executives' perception of the two systems. A representative sample of executives from all levels of the consumer grievance redress (CGR) machinery of the selected insurance corporate put forth their opinions on the nature of a CGR system, reasons behind its establishment, and the resulting benefits of maintaining the same. Furthermore, they have suggested more effective proposals for improving their own system as also the need for an external system, especially the Insurance Ombudsman. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - Despite many claims by high-ranking policy-makers and some scientists that climate change breeds violent conflict, the existing empirical literature has so far not been able to identify a systematic, causal relationship of this kind. This may either reflect de facto absence of such a relationship, or it may be the consequence of theoretical and methodological limitations of existing work. We revisit the climate–conflict issue along two lines. First, at the theoretical level we specify the mechanism through which climate change is likely to affect the risk of armed conflict. We focus on the causal chain linking climatic conditions, economic growth, and armed conflict, and also argue that the growth–conflict part of this chain is contingent on political system characteristics. Second, at the methodological level, we develop an approach that takes care of endogeneity problems in the climate–economy–conflict relationship. We test our theoretical argument on a global data set for 1950-2004. The results show that the climate change–conflict hypothesis rests on rather shaky empirical foundations: we do find some negative effects of climate change on economic growth, while stronger economic growth is associated with a lower probability of civil conflict. However, the climate change effect on growth is not robust to changes in climate indicators and samples. Our results also indicate that non-democratic countries are more likely to experience armed conflict when economic conditions deteriorate. Our results suggest that investing in climate-friendly economic growth and democracy can qualify as a no-regrets strategy.

AB  - Dynamic models arise in a vast array of transportation applications because of the need to capture the evolution of activities over time. This chapter focuses on modeling the organization and flow of information and decisions, in the context of freight transportation problems that involve the management of people and equipment to serve the needs of customers. The timing of the flow of capital is becoming an increasingly important dimension of freight transportation, but there has been virtually no formal research on the topic. Modeling the timing of physical activities, by contrast, dates to the 1950s. These models introduce a range of modeling and algorithmic challenges that have been studied since the early years of operations research models. Dynamic models have a number of applications. A dynamic process can be simulated to better understand the way for operating a system under more realistic settings. One application that often arises at many companies is a desire to develop models to help run their operations in real time.

AB  -  ABSTRACT The transportation sector consumes 70% of the petroleum that the U.S. uses for fuel, which leads one to study transportation to identify significant opportunities to save energy. Every 1-cent increase in the price of a gallon of gas costs the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) 8 million per year for their 200,000-vehicle fleet. To reduce American dependence on fossil fuels, the carbon footprint left by vehicular fleets should be evaluated. This article reports on the current state of fuel efficiency and fleet efficiency in the U.S., including government, municipal, and large commercial sectors. It also discusses opportunities in behavior modification to improve fleet efficiency. Case studies are presented showing evidence of best practices currently implemented. By studying transportation fleets and educating fleet managers about viable alternatives to improve fleet efficiency, we can save significant amounts of fuel and reduce our carbon footprint. This analysis demonstrates that transportation efficiency is economically feasible for a wide variety of public and private entities and is beneficial to the environment.

To explore this question, we tested the effect of methylphenidate on performance and associated brain activity in the Anticipation, Conflict, Reward (ACR) task. Sixteen healthy adult volunteers, ages 21-45, were scanned twice using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as they performed the ACR task under placebo and methylphenidate conditions. A three-way repeated measures analysis of variance, with cue (reward vs. non-reward), target (congruent vs. incongruent) and medication condition (methylphenidate vs. placebo) as the factors, was used to analyze behaviors on the task. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals, reflecting task-related neural activity, were evaluated using linear contrasts. Participants exhibited significantly greater accuracy in the methylphenidate condition than the placebo condition. Compared with placebo, the methylphenidate condition also was associated with lesser task-related activity in components of attention-activation systems irrespective of the reward cue, and less task-related activity in components of the reward-motivation system, particularly the insula, during reward trials irrespective of target difficulty. These results suggest that methylphenidate enhances task performance by improving efficiency of information processing in both reward-motivation and in attention-activation systems. © 2014.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It is explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point problem—in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user equilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost functions may not be symmetric—possesses a unique solution with mild conditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the stochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed equilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit functions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can be concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which can characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to stochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization problem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously differentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the unified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution method, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network optimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints. Finally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and algorithm.

AB  - A framework was developed for diagnosing manufacturer-reseller conflict from a manufacturer's point of view. Conflict between a reseller and a manufacturer is a function of: 1. differences in key factors, 2. the channel design of the manufacturer, and 3. the channel policies of the manufacturer. Of the key factors, conflict stems from differences in goals, desired target accounts, desired product lines, and interpersonal relations. The length, variety, density, and autonomy of the channels affect channel conflict. Manufacturers' channel policies can increase or reduce conflict with resellers, depending on their relative leniency or stringency. Low- and medium-conflict-level channel strategies require the skills of selecting the right channels and monitoring their performance. If manufacturers can anticipate the conflict levels that accompany different strategies, their organization can be better prepared with skills and tactics.

The efficiency of 82 road transportation companies responding to a large-scale survey focused on horizontal cooperation is evaluated, based on two inputs and two outputs. Various DEA models are used to identify differences between subgroups of respondents. The results demonstrate that, in general, Flemish road transportation companies operate at unacceptably low efficiency levels. Given the findings that the median company is operating on too small a scale, one apparent remedy would be a dramatic increase in market concentration through mergers and acquisitions.

For example, while we can travel anywhere in space, we appear to have no choice with regard to 'travel' in time. In this essay, I argue that when space and time are viewed in the light of Fichtean philosophy this asymmetry can be seen to be illusory. A consequence of this is that travel into the past is possible - so long as 'travel' is understood in a slightly unusual sense.

AB  - Risk prediction for a particular disease in a population through SNP genotyping exploits tests whose primary goal is to rank the SNPs on the basis of their disease association. This manuscript reveals a different approach of predicting the risk through network representation by using combined genotypic data (instead of a single allele/haplotype). The aim of this study is to classify diseased group and prediction of disease risk by identifying the responsible genotype. Genotypic combination is chosen from five independent loci present on platelet receptor genes P2RY1 and P2RY12. Genotype-sets constructed from combinations of genotypes served as a network input, the network architecture constituting super-nodes (e.g., case and control) and nodes representing individuals, each individual is described by a set of genotypes containing M markers (M = number of SNP). The analysis becomes further enriched when we consider a set of networks derived from the parent network. By maintaining the super-nodes identical, each network is carrying an independent combination of M-1 markers taken from M markers. For each of the network, the ratio of case specific and control specific connections vary and the ratio of super-node specific connection shows variability. This method of network has also been applied in another case-control study which includes oral cancer, precancer and control individuals to check whether it improves presentation and interpretation of data. The analyses reveal a perfect segregation between super-nodes, only a fraction of mixed state being connected to both the super-nodes (i.e. common genotype set). This kind of approach is favorable for a population to classify whether an individual with a particular genotypic combination can be in a risk group to develop disease. In addition with that we can identify the most important polymorphism whose presence or absence in a population can make a large difference in the number of case and control individuals.

We suggest that a bi-cone structure best describes human mental time travel (MTT) abilities. Experiments with scrub-jays, rats and non-human primates have investigated whether MTT is uniquely human by examining the abilities of these animals to remember what, where and when an event occurred and to anticipate future events. We argue that animal memory for when an event happened must be distinguished from memory for how long ago it happened to properly evaluate parallels with human capabilities. Similarly, tests of future MTT in animals must show that they are planning for a specific time in the future to demonstrate qualitative comparability with human MTT.

AB  - Barbary macaques, like other non-human primates living in highly seasonal temperate environments, display high monthly variations in their diet. In addition, their diet changes according to the habitat type they colonize and to the degree of habitat degradation due to resource exploitation by local people, in particular through pastoralism. We studied the time-budget adjustments of wild Barbary macaques in three cedar-oak forests impacted by different intensities of grazing pressure from goats and sheep. We examined how diet variations influenced the time monkeys spent in their activities and their day range lengths (i.e. their energy costs). At three studied sites, diet composition and time budgets showed marked seasonal variations. Diet composition had a strong influence on monkeys' time budget. In the forest where pastoralism was the highest, diet included a greater proportion of underground resources, shrub fruit and acorns, which led to an increase in the time spent foraging and moving, as well as an important increase in day range lengths. Energy costs were therefore higher in a degraded environment than in a suitable habitat. The monkeys living in forests subjected to pastoralism took advantage of increased day lengths to spend more time searching for food. However, in the forest with the highest pastoralism pressure, although monkeys spent more time foraging, they spent less time feeding than monkeys at the other sites. In addition, they appeared to have reached the limits of the available time they could devote to these activities, as their diurnal resting time was at its lowest level over several months. Temperature variations did not appear to modify monkeys' time budgets. In the least favourable habitat, saving time from resting activity allowed monkeys to maintain a relatively high level of social activity, partly linked to rearing constraints.

AB  - Transportation network design problem deals with how to add or improve some edges on an existing transportation network to improve traffic condition. In this study a bi-level programming model was proposed to optimize the strategy of transportation network capacity improvement in the constraint of budget. The upper level problem aims to minimize the total travel time of all transportation travelers, while the lower level model is users' equilibrium transportation assignment model. A quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm was employed to solve the problem. The result of numerical experiment indicated that the proposed model can reduce total travel time by searching optimal solution and the QEA is more efficient than other heuristic algorithm.

AB  - Many approaches to decision support for the academic library acquisition budget allocation have been proposed to diversely reflect the management requirements. Different from these methods that focus mainly on either statistical analysis or goal programming, this paper introduces a model (ABAMDM, acquisition budget allocation model via data mining) that addresses the use of descriptive knowledge discovered in the historical circulation data explicitly to support allocating library acquisition budget. The major concern in this study is that the budget allocation should be able to reflect a requirement that the more a department makes use of its acquired materials in the present academic year, the more it can get budget for the coming year. The primary output of the ABAMDM used to derive weights of acquisition budget allocation contains two parts. One is the descriptive knowledge via utilization concentration and the other is the suitability via utilization connection for departments concerned. An application to the library of Kun Shan University of Technology was described to demonstrate the introduced ABAMDM in practice. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The A11 diencephalospinal pathway is crucial for sensorimotor integration and pain control at the spinal cord level. When disrupted, it is thought to be involved in numerous painful conditions such as restless legs syndrome and migraine. Its anatomical organization, however, remains largely unknown in the non-human primate (NHP). We therefore characterized the anatomy of this pathway in the NHP.

AB  - The Federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) may be the most powerful of all environmental laws affecting transportation. They are intended to significantly affect transportation decision-making, not only to achieve air quality goals but also to affect broader environmental goals related to land use, travel mode choice, and reductions in vehicle miles traveled. The CAAA require greater integration of transportation and air quality planning, and assign a greater responsibility to transportation plans and programs for reducing mobile source emissions. By expanding the requirements for determining the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects with State Implementation Plans for air quality, and by expanding the use of highway funding sanctions to enforce those requirements, the CAAA ensure a continuing linkage between transportation and environmental goals. While the CAAA give transportation and air quality decision-makers the mandate to better coordinate their respective planning processes, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 offers the tools to help carry out that mandate. Consequently, this paper summa- rizes the transportation and air quality provisions of both of these Acts and their relationships.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - Experimentally-produced defects in the non-human primate are preferred for testing the efficacy and safety of periodontal regenerative therapies. These animals closely resemble the human in dental anatomy and periodontal wound healing physiology. Defects can be produced which do not display spontaneous regeneration and which are contralaterally identical. Thus, within animals, untreated controls can be obtained to indicate the level of supporting tissues prior to therapy. The use of non-human primate models is recommended for science transfer experiments involving invasive surgery and the testing of potentially harmful new devices and pharmaceuticals.

AB  - It has always been a daunting task for any government to allocate the budgets for public infrastructure effectively so as to maximize the benefits of the limited resources. The most important contribution this paper makes is to conduct an empirical study of the budget allocations of the six region-based road system construction plans in northern Taiwan using the transportation budget allocation model devised in this paper. After reviewing the results, the experts consulted while preparing this paper believe that these results are both objective and able to meet the actual requirements. The competent authority also believes that they are better than those obtained using their original approach. In particular, the construction of this model takes into consideration the highest-level supervisors. To a certain degree, it caters for the practices in budget allocation so that the managers are able to assume the authority corresponding to their responsibility concerning management efficiency and final outcomes.

AB  - In this paper, a one-pass budget allocation algorithm is proposed for hybrid video coding. Taking the percentage of skipped MBs as the measure of inter-frame dependency, the optimal budget allocation is first modeled for a two-frame case. Then this model is extended to a practical method in slow movement scenario, where the information of inter-frame dependency is predicted based on the previously coded frames. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the recommended MB and frame level rate control algorithms in H.264/AVC reference software JM 15.1. For eight CIF sequences with slow movement, significant gains of 0.91 dB and 0.43 dB on average (1.66 dB and 1.49 dB at maximum) were obtained over the reference MB and frame level rate control, respectively. Considering that the computational complexity by the proposed algorithm is quite low (less than 1% of the total coding time when fast motion estimation algorithm is enabled), it is quite appealing for real-time video applications.

AB  - Recently, hub-and-spoke networks employing central hub facilities to channel flows between interacting nodes have become popular with successful applications in ground and air transportation. In this paper, we introduce a framework for the design of this type of distribution network with networking policies and models together with exact and heuristic solution procedures. We consider two networking policies: (i) Nonstrict hubbing, in which channeling flows through hubs is not required but chosen if found cost efficient and (ii) strict and restrictive hubbing, in which all flows to/from a node are channeled through the same hub. Variations of these policies are discussed together with various aspects of air passenger and cargo transportation, effects of network organization on demand and network design under continuous economies of scale. The performances of the proposed algorithms and the effects of the networking policy implemented on the hub locations and the route structure are studied using data on air passenger flows between the top forty U.S. cities in 1989.

In this introductory note we briefly discuss whether we have, or in fact need, a universal definition of sexual conflict. We briefly summarize what for us were the main messages emerging from the meeting in relation to where the field of sexual conflict currently stands, before finally attempting to distil some of the important unanswered questions for the future. Our motivation for organizing the meeting was that it seemed to us that in the last ten years or so, there has been a dramatic shift in the prevailing view of matings as being essentially ‘a good thing’ for both participants, to one in which they are regarded as ‘bad’ for females. This change has been driven primarily by some very elegant empirical work, which has generated some passionate advocacy (and some equally passionate resistance) for the importance of conflict. However, whether evolutionary biologists were mistakenly viewing male– female interactions as more benign than they actually are, or whether there is now a tendency to overemphasize the importance of conflicts of interest, is a major question that warrants consideration. This discussion meeting provided an opportunity to explore the state of the art and whether sexual conflict is indeed a new paradigm. This was made possible by the hard work of the participants, whom we would like to take this opportunity to thank.

AB  - A transportation system to move students, faculty and staff on a university campus and its surrounding community continues to be an unmet need for most North American universities. A very important reason behind this problem is that effective methodologies to model travel demand in a university setting are not available, nor are analysis tools to compare the existing mobility with the projected mobility where major transportation improvement is planned for a university setting. In this study, a multi-modal travel demand model was developed to model the travel demand of students, faculty and staff in various transportation scenarios on a university campus and its surrounding community. The modeling methodology has several innovative characteristics, which adapt the model to a university setting and differentiate it from traditional travel demand models, including: (1) Individual trip generation and trip distribution information, such as class schedule, residence addresses, office addresses, etc., were used to construct student, faculty and staff trip tables. (2) A multi-modal transportation network was constructed that reflects the necessary interaction among motor vehicles, pedestrians, parking facilities and public transit facilities. (3) A time-of-day model that uses probability distribution functions (PDF) to simulate temporal distribution of trips was developed to realize the incremental trip assignment. The model was used to evaluate an existing transportation system and two alternatives, each with a Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) system assumed constructed on the Kansas State University (KSU) main campus. A multi-measure evaluation approach was developed to evaluate the mobility impact of the transportation alternatives examined. The evaluation results indicate that an appropriately designed PRT system could improve the mobility on a university campus, by saving travel time, increasing predictability of travel time throughout a weekday, relieving traffic congestion, and making distant parking lots as accessible as those close to or within the core campus area. The model performed well and generated reasonable results. The study methodology developed should be usable, without significant change, to other universities that have similar size and travel characteristics.

AB  - We present a neuropsychoanalytic experimental paradigm for demonstrating psychodynamic conflict. The strategy is threefold: to manipulate awareness of emotional stimuli that activate the psychodynamics of participants diagnosed with a pertinent psychological disorder; to compare their neurobiological vs. experiential responses to those of healthy participants; and to correlate the former patterns of neural activation of the diagnostic sample with attending patterns of behavior that are indicative of conflict. Behavioral experiments based on the paradigm have generated findings that are consistent with a theory of psychodynamic conflict. An ongoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study is comparing the scans of phobic, counterphobic, and healthy participants during exposure to masked and unmasked phobic stimuli. If the predicted patterns of neural activation of the phobic groups correlate with corresponding patterns of behavior, it will link brain and behavior in the demonstration of psychodynamic conflict

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of selecting the best design from a discrete number of alternatives in the presence of a stochastic constraint via simulation experiments. The best design is the design with smallest mean of main objective among the feasible designs. The feasible designs are the designs of which constraint measure is below the constraint limit. The Optimal Computing Budget Allocation (OCBA) framework is used to tackle the problem. In this framework, we aim at maximizing the probability of correct selection given a computing budget by controlling the number of simulation replications. An asymptotically optimal allocation rule is derived. A comparison with Equal Allocation (EA) in the numerical experiments shows that the proposed allocation rule gains higher probability of correct selection.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

Being probabilistic, the schemes described here have a finite probability of failure; in most cases, this probability is rather negligible (10(-17) is a typical value). In many situations, the new procedures are considerably more efficient and reliable than the classical (deterministic) ones; they also parallelize naturally. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the schemes.

AB  - In previous reports--including one by the author--learning has been shown to benefit by having discriminanda move rather than remain stationary. This stimulus movement effect might be attributed to several theoretical mechanisms, including attention, topological memory, and exposure duration. The series of experiments reported in this article was designed to contrast these potential explanatory factors. Ten rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were tested on a variety of computerized tasks in which the stimuli remained stationary, flashed, or moved at systematically varied speeds. Performance was significantly best when the sample stimulus moved quickly and was poorest when the stimulus remained stationary. Further analysis of these data and other previously published data revealed that the distribution of the stimulus movement effect across trials supported an attention allocation interpretation.

AB  - An iterative and constrained non-linear travel-time tomographic scheme is developed for imaging high-contrast inhomogeneities. The technique has been successfully tested using synthetic data. We have investigated the influence upon the image quality of the random errors in travel times for a cross-hole survey configuration. In the forward problem, the ray path is traced by finding the minimal travel time of each shot-receiver pair in the updated model. For non-linear inversion, we approximate the velocity distribution with a specific first-order surface function so that the analytical derivatives with respect to each grid-point value of the velocity variation can be calculated. A constrained inversion from an arbitrary starting model is implemented in an iterative fashion. Our results indicate that with 180° symmetric angular coverage and a cell size comparable to the minimum dimension of the target, it is possible to get a resolvable image of a high-contrast target only in the direction parallel to the boreholes, even without a priori information. Constraints from knowledge about the velocity distribution along the boreholes or along the surface are very important in overcoming the poor directional resolution. The combination of cross-hole data with VSP data substantially improves travel-time tomography as a means of imaging high-contrast inhomogeneities. The results also show that if the relative travel-time random errors in data exceed an estimated expected value of about 2.5% the fine detail in the shape of a reconstructed target could be severely distorted.

AB  - Pre-determination of the sex of offspring has implications for management and conservation of captive wildlife species, particularly those with single sex-dominated social structures. Our goal is to adapt flow cytometry technology to sort spermatozoa of non-human primate species for use with assisted reproductive technologies. The objectives of this study were to: (i) determine the difference in DNA content between X- and Y-bearing spermatozoa (ii) sort sperm nuclei into X- and Y-enriched samples; and (iii) assess the accuracy of sorting. Spermatozoa were collected from two common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), seven hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) and two common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Human spermatozoa from one male were used as a control. Sperm nuclei were stained (Hoechst 33342), incubated and analyzed using a high-speed cell sorter. Flow cytometric reanalysis of sorted samples (sort reanalysis, 10,000 events/sample) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; 500 sperm nuclei/sample) were used to evaluate accuracy of sorting. Based on fluorescence intensity of X- and Y-bearing sperm nuclei, the difference in DNA content between X and Y populations was 4.09 ± 0.03, 4.20 ± 0.03, 3.30 ± 0.01, and 2.97 ± 0.05%, for marmoset, baboon, chimpanzee and human, respectively. Sort reanalysis and FISH results were similar; combined data revealed high levels of purity for X- and Y-enriched samples (94 ± 0.9 and 93 ± 0.8%, 94 ± 0.7 and 94 ± 0.5%, 91 ± 0.9 and 97 ± 0.6%, 94 ± 0.6 and 94 ± 0.9%, for marmoset, baboon, chimpanzee and human, respectively).

AB  - This article contains the argument that the human ability to travel mentally in time constitutes a discontinuity between ourselves and other animals. Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. It is not an isolated module, but depends on the sophistication of other cognitive capacities, including self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception-knowledge relationship, and the ability to dissociate imagined mental states from one's present mental state. These capacities are also important aspects of so-called theory of mind, and they appear to mature in children at around age 4. Furthermore, mental time travel is generative, involving the combination and recombination of familiar elements, and in this respect may have been a precursor to language. Current evidence, although indirect or based on anecdote rather than on systematic study, suggests that nonhuman animals, including the great apes, are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. In contrast, mental time travel by humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning. Past and future events loom large in much of human thinking, giving rise to cultural, religious, and scientific concepts about origins, destiny, and time itself. References: 190

AB  - This thesis illuminates the processes of sustainable conflict transformation between Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australians. The literature review explores Indigenous approaches of consensual conflict processing, discussing the central characteristics of the worldview underlying the methodologies. The literature review also compares Indigenous methods of consensual conflict processing with Western conflict resolution and conflict transformation methods, examining differences and similarities in worldview. This thesis discusses the ways in which Indigenous worldviews have been and continue to be suppressed through the processes of colonisation.  In the literature review the author identifies the central characteristics of the worldview underlying Australian Aboriginal, Native American and Native Hawaiian models of processing conflict: interconnectedness, emphasis on processes and relationships; inclusion of holistic experience; and expanded conceptualisations of time. These characteristics are contrasted with the central characteristics of the dominant Western worldview underlying problem solving models of processing conflict. This worldview is characterised by: a mechanistic paradigm which is atomistic and analytical; emphasis on technique rather than process; privileging the intellectual aspects of experience; and linear conceptualisations of time. The author argues that because of these differences in worldview, implementing Western problem solving models in conflicts involving Indigenous peoples at best leads to short term solutions to conflict, and at worst may exacerbate existing conflicts.  This thesis proposes a connection between Indigenous and Western consensual conflict processing in that the practice of Western conflict transformation is based on a worldview similar to that of Indigenous consensual conflict processing. The third literature review chapter identifies the central characteristics of Western conflict transformation to be: a paradigm of interconnectedness; emphasis on relationship and process; holistic experience; and expanded conceptualisations of time.   The author suggests that this thesis serves as an example of conflict transformation in and of itself in that it creates a synthesis on several levels: it integrates Indigenist and emergent Western epistemologies and methodologies; it proposes a synthesis of Aboriginal and non-Indigenous participants' experiences of conflict transformation; and it explores the interconnections between Western conflict transformation and the ethnopraxis discussed m the findings chapters.  In the methodology section, the author describes this research project's emphasis on story, maintaining that use of story in data collection and analysis bridges both Indigenous and Western epistemologies. Use of story as a research method supports interconnections between personal experience and the web of larger experience and meaning.  The methodology of Interconnected Knowing utilised in this research is designed to support both Indigenist and emergent Western epistemologies in that: it is based on a paradigm of interconnectedness; focuses on processes and relationships rather than technique; involves expanded concepts of data; and integrates intellectual, emotional, bodily and spiritual aspects of experience.  The findings chapters demonstrate that conflict transformation between Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australians involves a complex web of interconnected projects and programs designed to implement long term positive social change. The author discusses the ways in which the practices of colonisation have silenced Indigenous knowledge and practice of conflict transformation. Rather than drawing solely on literature, the author has focused on ethnopraxis, participants' experience of transforming conflict between Indigenous and non- Indigenous Australians. This thesis increases current knowledge regarding ethnoconflict theory and practice.  This thesis proposes a synthesis of participants' experience of conflict transformation, the author's field research and experience, and written accounts of the experience of other Australians involved in conflict transformation. The synthesis is expressed through six themes which represent the authors' understanding of the central characteristics of the process of conflict transformation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. These themes illuminate processes of  • Developing deep understanding • Utilising the power of emotions • Developing relationships • Working together to implement positive social change • Balancing inequalities • Personal transformation  This thesis proposes that sustainable conflict transformation between Aboriginal and non-Indigenous Australians is a process of understanding of the issues underlying current conflict, improving relationships, and supporting an infrastructure of programs and projects that increase social justice.  In the final section, conclusions are drawn regarding the inadequacies of Western conflict problem solving models of conflict resolution in conflicts between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in colonised societies. Links are made between Western conflict transformation and the ethnopraxis illuminated within this research. The findings of this research refer directly to the Australian context, yet may have implications for other Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples seeking to transform conflict within deeply divided societies.

AB  - Since the discovery of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) causing AIDS-like diseases in Asian macaques, non-human primates (NHP) have played an important role in AIDS vaccine research. A multitude of vaccines and immunization approaches have been evaluated, including live attenuated viruses, DNA vaccines, viral and bacterial vectors, subunit proteins, and combinations thereof. Depending on the particular vaccine and model used, varying degrees of protection have been achieved, including prevention of infection, reduction of viral load, and amelioration of disease. In a few instances, potential safety concerns and vaccine-enhanced pathogenicity have also been noted. In the past decade, sophisticated methodologies have been developed to define the mechanisms of protective immunity. However, a clear road map for HIV vaccine development has yet to emerge. This is in part because of the intrinsic nature of the surrogate model and in part because of the improbability of any single model to fully capture the complex interactions of natural HIV infection in humans. The lack of standardization, the limited models available, and the incomplete understanding of the immunobiology of NHP contribute to the difficulty to extrapolate findings from such models to HIV vaccine development. Until efficacy data become available from studies of parallel vaccine concepts in humans and macaques, the predictive value of any NHP model remains unknown. Towards this end, greater appreciation of the utility and limitations of the NHP model and further developments to better mimic HIV infection in humans will likely help inform future AIDS vaccine efforts.

AB  - If episodic memory is an adaptation, it must have evolved to benefit present or future survival and reproduction, rather than to provide an accurate record of the past per se. Recent research has documented various links between the ability to construct episodes of the past and imagine potential future episodes, and it has been argued that the former may be a design feature of the latter. Thus, claims about the existence of episodic memory in non-verbal organisms may be evaluated by examining behavioural evidence for foresight. Here we review recent data on foresight in animals and conclude that the evidence to suggest episodic memory so far is equivocal. We suggest specific experimental criteria that could provide stronger evidence. We maintain that there must be uniquely human traits for which there are no animal models and it remains possible that mental time travel depends on several such traits. Identification of what precisely is unique about the human capacity and what is not, can inform us about the nature and evolution of the human capacities. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Behavioral rating scales for dyskinesia in the non-human primate are frequently used to assess the efficacy of new treatments and to provide a clinical correlative with neurochemical and neuropathological changes. Although a large variety of different scales have been used in non-human primate studies, there is no single standardized scale, and none have been evaluated for reliability and validity. We are reporting a new global non-human primate dyskinesia rating scale (GPDRS) for the squirrel monkey, developed in the context of an independent study of dyskinesia. In this report we demonstrate the reliability and validity of this scale. The GPDRS is a single-item scale with well-defined points and brevity allowing for rapid and easy application for assessing the overall degree of dyskinesia. In this study, seven MPTP-lesioned and four non-lesioned (control) non-human primates were videotaped following treatment with either levodopa or water. To test inter- and intra-rater reliability, three examiners rated the videotape independently at two different time points and these assessments were compared. The validity of the scale was tested in two phases. First, examiners rated the videotape using the GPDRS and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), a scale commonly used to rate dyskinesia in the non-human primate, and the ratings from each scale were compared. Second, validity was tested in the context of an independent dyskinesia study, in which the scale was used to distinguish between two treatment groups. The GPDRS was shown to have high inter- and intra-rater reliability and to be valid for the assessment of dyskinesia in the squirrel monkey. In this report we also demonstrate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the AIMS.

It is argued that time travel raises formidable difficulties which are not resolved by Lewis's ingenious defense. Objections to time travel considered include: (1) travel to order times is impossible because there is nowhere (or "nowhen") to go; (2) in setting out on a journey to the past a time machine will collide with itself; (3) time travel generates a mysterious temporal dualism between experiential time and physical time; (4) travel to the past would permit reverse causation, raising the possibility of causal loops and the attendant problems arising, for example, from the prospect of empirical contradiction and the possibility of someone being one of their ancestors.

The development of strategies for the preservation of fertility is used as an example of ongoing research in the non-human primate that cannot be conducted in women for ethical reasons.

AB  - In lean and demand-responsive logistics systems, orders need to be delivered rapidly, accurately, and reliably, even under demand uncertainty. Increasing burdens on the industry motivate the introduction of new methods to manage transportation service contracts. One way to hedge transportation capacity and cost volatility is to create derivative contracts. To date, ocean transportation is the only mode of transportation where this type of contract has been applied. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of freight transportation derivatives and to discuss some recent relevant research. We start by introducing the theory underlying derivative contracts, before reviewing the development of derivatives markets in the maritime industry. We then investigate the adoption of derivatives contracts in trucking (the dominant mode of freight transportation), which we call truckload options. A numerical example follows to illustrate how derivatives could help financially both shippers and carriers. Finally, this article discusses the conditions necessary for the emergence of a market for truckload options.

AB  - The present study linked general mental ability (GMA) to extrinsic career success using a multilevel framework that included time and 3 possible time-based mediators of the GMA-career success relationship. Results, based on a large national sample, revealed that over a 28-year period, GMA affected growth in 2 indicators of extrinsic career success (income and occupational prestige), such that the careers of high-GMA individuals ascended more steeply over time than those of low-GMA individuals. Part of the reason high-GMA individuals had steeper growth in extrinsic success over time was because they attained more education, completed more job training, and gravitated toward more complex jobs. GMA also moderated the degree to which within-individual variation in the mediating variables affected within-individual variation in extrinsic career success over time: Education, training, and job complexity were much more likely to translate into career success for more intelligent individuals.

AB  - The ability to travel in time mentally, i. e. the re-experiencing of personal past events as well as the ability to mentally simulate potential future events, forms part of the "episodic memory" concept. Evidence for the notion that episodic memory and episodic future thinking share a common neural basis stems from different lines of research, namely functional neuroimaging, assessment of clinical groups, behavioral investigations of the phenomenological characteristics of mental time travel, and developmental research. The present article summarises the evidence from these lines of research which indicate a common neural network underlying episodic memory and episodic future thinking, consisting of medial prefrontal, medial temporal, medial parietal, lateral parieto-occipital, as well as lateral temporal regions. Both abilities, episodic memory and future thinking, seem to develop around the age of four years, feature similar phenomenological characteristics, and are impaired to a similar extent by brain lesions and brain dysfunction. These findings yielded different hypotheses concerning the function and evolutional significance of the mental time travel network, which will also be addressed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To examine the amounts and role of growth factors in different tissues and corporal fluid, new sensitive techniques have to be developed. A major problem is that the normal concentration of trophic substances, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), in central and peripheral nervous system and in fluids is very low (ng pg/ml). A valuable method of research is the sensitive two site enzyme immunoassay using the monoclonal antibody 27/21 to mouse NGF. Materials and methods. The present work applied this enzyme immunoassay to examine the NGF levels in normal non human primate sera (n= 94) and applied this assay to study of NGF levels in two non human primate receiving NGF infusion: one young and one aged. Two groups of non human primate sera were studied one young adult (n= 69) and one aged (n= 25). The serum samples NGF treated non human primate were taken before the infusion and at the 1st week and 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th month after infusion. RESULTS: To further test the specificity of conjugate binding, dilutions of the non human primate sera were preincubated with an excess of monoclonal NGF antibody 27/21 in solution. With this strategy it was possible to completely block the signal obtained using the enzyme immunoassay. We found very low levels of NGF in aged monkeys (0.054 ng/ml) when compared with young adult group (0.152 ng/ml) (p> 0.01). The NGF levels in aged non human primate treatment with NGF was very low before (0.50 ng/ml) and during NGF treatment evolution time, whereas at the the 12th month showed an increase in NGF levels (0.180 ng/ml). We found normal values of NGF in the young monkey before and during the first year after NGF infusion. CONCLUSIONS: Using the enzyme immunoassay described it is possible to know the serum concentration of NGF immunoreactive in non human primate and this assay is able to detect peripheral changes in NGF levels after intracerebral infusion of NGF.

AB  - A model is developed which allocates an available budget to research alternatives subject to budgetary constraints on both organizational and technical entities. The solution algorithm is based on the out-of-kilter minimum cost network flow algorithm and is programmed for use in a time-share, conversational mode. Although the model does not describe the decision processes observed empirically, its output is sufficiently similar to actual allocations that it can be viewed as predictive. Strengths and weaknesses of the model are detailed based on questionnaire and interview data provided by the potential users of the system. The decision information system is used to illustrate that experimentation concerned with better understanding of the adoption process can be used to facilitate model design and application.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability.

This paper presents a bi-level optimization model—in which the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first time— for solving the public transportation network redesign problem (PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total cost, includ- ing user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost, for the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource- and policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user self-routing optimiza- tion problem in which all transit users try to find the transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number of transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic algorithm–based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP bi-level optimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical results are described.

The model seeks to maximize expected system capacity subject to uncertainty that will occur in the future demand pattern and with a limited budget for investment. Simulated annealing is used to solve the investment planning problem. A case study of a simplified version of the western U.S. double-stack container network is included to illustrate the application of the model.

AB  - In the recent times, due to the increasing rate of global warming, the northeast region of Nigeria has been experiencing continuous climatic change characterized by drastic reduction in rainfall, increase in the rate of dryness and heat, which makes it a fast growing arid environment, with depletion in the amount of water, flora and fauna resources on the land. In response to the pastoral and arable farm occupational needs of the people, there has been continuous population drift southward where there are more fauna, flora and water resources. Following the above, an important question that needs to be addressed is how has the pressure over scarce resources consequent to climatic change led to communal civil violent conflict in the area? And what have been the patterns over the years? Against this background, this work focuses on investigating the chain of interactions between climate change, population drift and pressure, and conflict over land resources. Specifically this article addresses the nature of communal civil violent conflicts in the northeast area of Nigeria, the extent to which continuous climate change has contributed to the scenario, the patterns of the climatically induced violent conflicts, the major actors and the policy implications of the conflict in the sub region. Among other theoretical orientations, this discourse anchors on and utilizes the Toronto School of Environmental Scarcity and Conflicts paradigm in examining what obtains in the study area. However, it went step further to present a fair critical overview of the weakness and strength of the theoretical postulation of 'ecoviolence' of the Toronto school as amplified by Homer-Dixon, his associates and other scholars in the field of conflict analysis; Reprinted by permission of the publisher Kamla-Raj Enterprises, Delhi, India

AB  - In many situations it can be enormously helpful to archive the raw\ncontents of a network trafﬁc stream to disk, to enable later inspection\nof activity that becomes interesting only in retrospect. We present\na Time Machine (TM) for network trafﬁc that provides such a capability.\nThe TM leverages the heavy-tailed nature of network ﬂows to capture\nnearly all of the likely-interesting trafﬁc while storing only a\nsmall fraction of the total volume. An initial\n\nproof-of-principle prototype established the forensic value of such\nan approach, contributing to the investigation of numerous attacks\nat a site with thousands of users. Based on these experiences, a\nrearchitected implementation of the system provides ﬂexible, high-performance\ntrafﬁc stream capture, indexing and retrieval, including an interface\nbetween the TM and a real-time network intrusion detection system\n(NIDS). The NIDS controls the TM by dynamically adjusting recording\nparameters, instructing it to permanently store suspicious activity\nfor ofﬂine forensics, and fetching trafﬁc from the past for retrospective\nanalysis. We present a detailed performance evaluation of both stand-alone\nand joint setups, and report on experiences with running the system\nlive in high-volume environments.

AB  - A commonly held intuitive belief is that we steadily improve our decision-making over time by learning from experience. This is a myth because learning from experience is quite complex and difficult due to many reasons. The reality is that gaps exist among our anticipations, experiences, and memories. We routinely engage in mental time travel when we anticipate our future and remember our past. Research in psychology and neuroscience reveals that many of these anticipations and remembrances are systematically inaccurate and lead us to hold illusions about how we will or do behave. This Article analyzes a number of temporally-caused illusions that we have about our financial, ethical, and tortious decision-making. These illusions in turn influence our financial, ethical, and tortious decision-making. Such decision-making tasks can be complex; demand focused, cognitive attention; generate noisy feedback; and provoke anxiety, stress, and other strong and quite often negative emotions. The reality is that our experiences are intrinsically complex, endogenous, and scarce. The reality is that we selectively reconstruct our memories of experiences. The reality is that we have limited attention with which to learn. The reality is that we are motivated to pay attention to that which we like to think about and ignore that which we find unpleasant. This Article applies research about human learning in general and human learning from experience in particular to explain how and why human learning will inevitably be incomplete. This Article considers legal implications of bounded learning. Creative examples of responses to bounded learning include financial entertainment computer video games, such as one where a player is a vampire managing a blood bar and planning for retirement. Empathy, identity, and tangibility gaps exist between our present and future selves. Two tools that act effectively as behavioral time machines to facilitate our mental time travel and close the above gaps are: future lifestyle imagination exercises and virtual reality avatars of our aged-morphed future selves. This Article concludes by explaining how fostering increased mindfulness can help us mitigate temporal illusions.

AB  - "As traditional sources of funding for the nation's surface transportation system fail to keep pace with demand, proposals for new sources have proliferated. New funding strategies, such as pricing the use of new and existing roads, and new institutional arrangements, such as public-private partnerships, have emerged over the past few years. As with all transportation policies, these strategies raise questions about equity. To address these concerns, the Transportation Research Board convened an expert committee to provide guidance to public officials about assessing the equity of evolving transportation finance mechanisms. The committee's findings are presented in this report. They are organized under the following chapter headings: (1) Equity and Transportation Finance; (2) How Transportation is Funded and Who Pays; (3) Equity Through Different Lenses; (4) Transportation Finance Equity: Evidence and Experience; (5) Equity and Decision Making: Experience with Road Pricing; and (6) Findings and Recommendations."--pub. desc.

AB  - This paper studies the endogenous determination of public budget allocation across hierarchical education stages. In less developed economies, the top class has dominant political power to implement its most preferred policy, which is characterized by exclusive participation and large schooling expenditure at higher education at the expense of basic education. In developed economies, the budget allocation is more balanced; under certain parameters, it leads to expanded participation of the middle class in higher education. The model offers an explanation to the observed cross-country policy difference and is broadly consistent with historical evidence. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article presents and studies models for multi-criteria budget allocation problems under uncertainty. The proposed models incorporate uncertainties in decision maker's weights using a robust weighted sum approach. The risk averseness of the decision maker in satisfying random risk-related constraints is ensured by using stochastic dominance. A sample average approximation approach together with a cutting surface method is used to solve this model. An analysis for the computation of statistical lower and upper bounds is also given. The proposed models are used to study the budget allocation to ten urban areas in the United States under the Urban Areas Security Initiative. Here the decision maker considers property losses, fatalities, air departures, and average daily bridge traffic as separate criteria. The properties of the proposed modeling and solution methodology are discussed using a RAND Corporation–proposed allocation policy and the current government budget allocation as two benchmarks. The budget results are discussed under several parameter scenarios.

AB  - Humans have cognitive mechanisms that allow them to keep track of time, represent past events, and simulate the future, but these capacities have intrinsic constraints. Here, we explore the role of material culture as an extension of internal time representations through anthropological and archeological case studies, focusing on Upper Paleolithic material culture. We argue that calendars complement and extend internal time representations, because they enable humans to project past events into the future more accurately than is possible with episodic memory alone, making them one of the factors that significantly improved foraging success during the Upper Paleolithic. We discuss the implications of the epistemic use of material culture for our understanding of the causes of shifts in human behavior during the Upper Paleolithic.

Presentism is opposed to four-dimensionalism, according to which the universe is an existing space-time manifold, containing everything that has happened, everything that is happening, and everything that will happen. It is commonly believed that four-dimensionalism is compatible with the possibility of time-travel, but that presentism is not. We argue against this common view. Our claim is that if presentism is at all plausible and four-dimensionalism is compatible with the possibility of time travel, then presentism is compatible with the possibility of time-travel. There is time-travel whenever certain events occur and stand in certain relations, and our strategy is to that those patterns of events and relations can be coherently described from within a presentist framework; a presentist can mimic four-dimensionalist descriptions of such events. Along the way, we examine presentist strategies for accounting for persistence through time, personal identity, and true claims about the past and future.

AB  - Studies of future-oriented capacities today are based on Cartesian epistemology. In this paper it is suggested that, following this epistemology, not only the answers to scientific questions, but even the questions themselves should be replaced. Particularly, instead of asking whether some form of future-oriented cognition might be unique to humans, and what are the "causes" of such capacities; it might be more productive to ask, in the framework of the structural-systemic epistemology, what level of analysis corresponds to future-oriented capacities, and in what form their structure is organized. The structural-systemic theory of functional systems by the Russian physiologist Piotr Anokhin is described, where it is shown that future orientation is the central characteristic of living systems. Furthermore, it is an essential property of all life-forms as wholes. Therefore understanding of future-oriented capacities requires description of what Anokhin called functional systems, systems that can be found in all life forms. Starting from Anokhin's structural-systemic epistemology, it is possible to go further and build a developmental theory of different kinds of future-orientation. It is proposed that future-orientation as a characteristic of life has evolved into psychical future-oriented cognition. From there, in turn, qualitatively novel forms of semiotically mediated future-oriented processes have emerged. Building a theory of future-oriented capacities in this direction seems to be scientifically more productive than continuing the theory-building following the fundamentally limited Cartesian epistemology.

AB  - Worry as a trait is an individual's general tendency to become worried, which in severe cases is associated with the diagnosis Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Mental time travel (MTT) is the ability to mentally project oneself into one's personal past or future, in terms of memories of personal past events or projections of possible events in the personal future. MTT can be voluntarily initiated or occur involuntarily. The current exploratory study investigated involuntary and voluntary MTT in the context of trait worry, thereby bringing together research on worry and MTT. High (N=20) and low (N=16) worriers recorded involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memories and future projections using a structured diary method. We predicted that MTT in high worriers would show signs of cognitive avoidance, such as reduced emotional intensity, more observer perspective, less visual imagery, or coming up with overgeneral or less self-relevant events. We found only partial support for our hypotheses in that high worriers rated personal memories and future projections lower on measures of self-relevance than did low worriers.

The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon that enables the earth to maintain a medium temperature of 15o medium system’s equilibrium of radiation is less incoming solar radiation than outgoing earth surface radiation, whereas the two figures should be equal. Consequently, a large quantity of radiation is blocked in the earth’s atmosphere thus resulting in the aggravation of climate change and for that reason provokes the increase of medium temperature from 0,3-0,6o the ice melting. C and the elevation of oceans level 10-25cm due to Especially in a city like Athens where the air does not circulate properly due to its mountainous morphology and high medium temperature, the greenhouse effect makes the atmosphere unbearable. Furthermore, the gas emissions that circulate in Athens can not escape consequently they block the outgoing radiation and multiply its adverse effects within the atmosphere. It is therefore obvious that these consequences call for immediate action, particularly in the transport sector where everyone has the ability to choose and the capacity to contribute to our planet’s preservation!

The forecasts are obtained up to December 2008 using Linear Trend Equation, Semi-log Trend Equation, Holt's Method, Winter's Method and ARIMA Model. The accuracy of forecast obtained through various methods is compared with the monthly actual production data of natural rubber for the period from January 2006 to March 2007, the last month for which actual production data were available. This period is also used as a hold-out sample. It is found that Winter's method gives the best result followed by Holt's method and Semi-log trend equation. The MAPE of Winter's, Holt's method, and Semi-log trend equation are 8.01 per cent, 8.09 per cent and 8.12 per cent respectively. It is therefore suggested that Winter's method could be used for forecasting the natural rubber production in India. The forecasting method for production of natural rubber in India, as shown in this paper, can be a very useful tool for the Indian rubber industry professionals and policy makers in India.

AB  - Reconstructing the past and anticipating the future, i.e., the ability of travelling in mental time, is thought to be at the heart of consciousness and, by the same token, at the center of human cognition. This extraordinary mental activity is possible thanks to the ability of being aware of ‘subjective time’. In the present study, we attempt to trace back the first recorded reflections on the relations between time and memory, to the end of the fourth century’s work, the Confessions, by the theologian and philosopher, St. Augustine. We concentrate on Book 11, where he extensively developed a series of articulated and detailed observations on memory and time. On the bases of selected paragraphs, we endeavor to highlight some concepts that may be considered as the product of the first or, at least, very early reflections related to our current notions of subjective time in mental time travel. We also draw a fundamental difference inherent to the frameworks within which the questions were raised. The contribution of St. Augustine on time and memory remains significant, notwithstanding the 16 centuries elapsed since it was made, likely because of the universality of its contents.

AB  - The description of numerous viruses belonging to the Lymphocryptovirus genus from different Old and New World non-human primate species during the past 10 years has led to developing and supporting co-speciational evolution hypotheses for these viruses and their hosts. Among the different primate species tested, only a few were from the New World. This study attempted to achieve a better understanding of the evolutionary processes within the Platyrrhini branch. Molecular screening of 253 blood DNA samples from 20 New World non-human primate species from Central and South America was carried out using polymerase chain reaction amplification with degenerate consensus primers targeting highly conserved amino acid motifs of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene. In addition to the 33 samples from which we have already described three lymphocryptoviruses, amplification products were detected in 17 other samples originating from 11 species (13 sub-species). BLAST searches, pairwise nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons, and phylogenetic analyses confirm that they all belong to the Lymphocryptovirus genus. Fourteen distinct Lymphocryptovirus sequences were detected, of which nine have never been reported. Phylogenetic analyses showed that, as expected, the New World virus lineage formed a sister clade to that of the Old World viruses. The parallel determination of the host taxa has demonstrated a good correlation between the distinct monophyletic clades of viruses and the infected primates at the sub-family level. In addition, these results further suggest the existence of two distinct groups within the Cebidae for Saimirinae and Cebinae primates. Nevertheless, based on the current genetic data, this study fell short of achieving a tree that was completely resolved within the lineage of Platyrrhini viruses. Further studies will be needed to better assess the evolutionary relationships between these viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interleukin (IL)-15 is a chemotactic factor to T cells. It induces proliferation and promotes survival of activated T cells. IL-15 receptor blockade in mouse cardiac and islet allotransplant models has led to long-term engraftment and a regulatory T-cell environment. This study investigated the efficacy of IL-15 receptor blockade using Mut-IL-15/Fc in an outbred non-human primate model of renal allotransplantation. METHODS: Male cynomolgus macaque donor-recipient pairs were selected based on ABO typing, major histocompatibility complex class I typing, and carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester-based mixed lymphocyte responses. Once animals were assigned to one of six treatment groups, they underwent renal transplantation and bilateral native nephrectomy. Serum creatinine level was monitored twice weekly and as indicated, and protocol biopsies were performed. Rejection was defined as a increase in serum creatinine to 1.5 mg/dL or higher and was confirmed histologically. Complete blood counts and flow cytometric analyses were performed periodically posttransplant; pharmacokinetic parameters of Mut-IL-15/Fc were assessed. RESULTS: Compared with control animals, Mut-IL-15/Fc-treated animals did not demonstrate increased graft survival despite adequate serum levels of Mut-IL-15/Fc. Flow cytometric analysis of white blood cell subgroups demonstrated a decrease in CD8 T-cell and natural killer cell numbers, although this did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, two animals receiving Mut-IL-15/Fc developed infectious complications, but no infection was seen in control animals. Renal pathology varied widely. CONCLUSIONS: Peritransplant IL-15 receptor blockade does not prolong allograft survival in non-human primate renal transplantation; however, it reduces the number of CD8 T cells and natural killer cells in the peripheral blood.

AB  - Non-human primates exhibit similar physiological and behavioral responses to anxiety-inducing situations as humans and have, in fact, been successfully employed in both conditioned (i.e. conflict paradigms) and ethologically based tests of fear/anxiety (i.e. involuntary isolation, social interaction, human threat, predator confrontation). In the last decade, a renewed and growing interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of the small callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety, addressing their advantages, shortcomings, and conceptual framework on which they are based. Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and fear-induced avoidance in callitrichids-the marmoset predator confrontation test-is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In 1997, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) will be reauthorized, and the formula for distributing federal highway funds to states is likely to be a key issue in the reauthorization process. One reason for the upcoming formula debate is that the current allocation process is not reflective of current federal objectives in transportation. Alternative proposals for distributing federal highway funds have already been introduced to Congress. ISTEA reauthorization will provide Congress with an opportunity to review the federal objectives in transportation and to reflect these objectives in the distribution of federal highway funds to states. In preparation for this debate, alternative scenarios for distributing federal highway funds are explored, and the scenarios are evaluated on the basis of the present overarching federal objectives in transportation. Included in this process is an evaluation of formula factors, such as lane miles and vehicle miles traveled, that make up individual scenarios. The goal is to encourage debate on and add to the discussion of how federal highway funds are or should be distributed to states.

AB  - Studies indicate that the Thai Government’s policy to conserve forest resources in protected areas has resulted in conflict between local population and government official. Thus, this study was initiated to determine the underlying causes and consequences of the conflict on local villagers’ livelihood and forest resources as well as effectiveness of the procedure used to manage it. Both qualitative and quantitative information has been collected from different sources. According to the finding, the underlying cause of the conflict have been found to be the national forest protection policy which sees forests as free from human interference resulting in establishment of conservation areas in place where the village Ban Pang Eka is already established. The establishment of such conservation forests resulted in restriction of agricultural lands which further brought change in villagers’ livelihood strategies of the villagers to labour work. Although it is hardly possible to correlate the conflict with the degradation of the forest, both the direct and indirect evidences show that the forest in the area is in the trend of degradation and the conflict over the use of the forest has its own share to the degradation. Further more, the procedures used to manage the conflict by establishing a community forest which was proposed by villagers didn’t have  legal recognition and the conflict was left suspended without being addressed in a proper manner. Based on this particular study which was done basically on local level views, the problem concerning forest resource management in Ban Pang Eka village has affected both the villagers and the forest resources. Thus there is a need to consider local participation and views in management of forest resource in the area since it is certain that the place cannot be free from human involvement.

AB  - In corporate finance, financing decision has gained greater importance because the optimal capital structure can be created through proper mix of finance. Corporate managers generally prefer borrowings over other means of financing. Management of a company has to be very careful while deciding the extent of financial leverage in its capital structure because the right use of financial leverage can increase the shareholders' wealth whereas its improper use would adversely affect the interest of shareholders. This study examines the empirical effects of corporate capital structure (financial leverage) on cost of capital and the market value of selected firms of Indian Cement Industry for the period from 2000-01 to 2007-08. The research evidence of the study indicates that no impact of financial leverage on cost of capital was found in the cement industry in India, i.e. no significant linear relationship between the financial leverage and cost of capital exists, and there is no correlation between the financial leverage and total valuation within the cement industry. Or in other words, financial leverage does not affect the total valuation of a firm in the cement industry in India. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Mechanisms that produce behavior which increase future survival chances provide an adaptive advantage. The flexibility of human behavior is at least partly the result of one such mechanism, our ability to travel mentally in time and entertain potential future scenarios. We can study mental time travel in children using language. Current results suggest that key developments occur between the ages of three to five. However, linguistic performance can be misleading as language itself is developing. We therefore advocate the use of methodologies that focus on future-oriented action. Mental time travel required profound changes in humans' motivational system, so that current behavior could be directed to secure not just present, but individually anticipated future needs. Such behavior should be distinguishable from behavior based on current drives, or on other mechanisms. We propose an experimental paradigm that provides subjects with an opportunity to act now to satisfy a need not currently experienced. This approach may be used to assess mental time travel in nonhuman animals. We conclude by describing a preliminary study employing an adaptation of this paradigm for children. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Non-human primates (NHP) have become an indispensable model in studying the common and dangerous human chronic infections, including HIV/SIV, Hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis. More recently, we and others have used aged NHP to model human immune aging. Chronic infections and aging are both characterized by a significant depletion of defined lymphocyte subsets and the compensatory attempts to regenerate the immune system. As the efficacious antiviral drugs and novel methods to improve and boost the immune system emerge, therapeutic immune regeneration has become a realistic goal in both the physiologic and pathologic settings. This article will summarize our current knowledge on this topic and will discuss future research directions as well as the potential and power of translational studies in non-human primate models of infection, aging and bone marrow transplantation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Network Design Problem (NDP) is one of the important problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems. In general, decision making in rail freight transportation has three main levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. In the field of rail freight transportation planning, MCND occurs in all levels of decision making such as car blocking, train makeup, and empty car distribution. This paper presents a review of MCND problems modeling, their applications in rail freight transportation planning, and solution methods which have been developed to solve them.

AB  - Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that the network capacity can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level. It is a supply-side reliability measure for assessing the adequacy of a degradable transportation network. The network capacity model used to calculate the capacity reliability measure is based on the concept of reserve capacity, which requires preserving a pre-determined origin-destination (O-D) demand pattern. In this paper, we relax this assumption by allowing a non-uniform growth in the spatial distribution of the O-D demand pattern. By using this non-uniform O-D growth approach, two network capacity models related to the concepts of ultimate capacity and practical capacity are developed to estimate alternate capacity reliability measures. Numerical results are provided to analyze the features of three capacity reliability measures for transportation networks. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - This paper by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), prepared at the request of the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, examines the effect that changing the estate tax would have on donations to charity. Because charitable bequests lower the taxable amount of estates, the tax gives people an incentive to contribute to charity at death rather than leave assets to heirs. Furthermore, the estate tax provides an incentive to make charitable contributions during life. The paper finds that increasing the amount exempted from the estate tax from $675,000 to either $2 million or $3.5 million would reduce charitable giving by less than 3 percent. However, repealing the tax would have a larger impact, decreasing donations to charity by 6 percent to 12 percent.

AB  - The study of air emission in maritime transportation is new, and the recognition of its importance has been rising in the recent decade. The emissions of CO2, SO2, NO2 and particulate matters from maritime transportation have contributed to climate change and environmental degradation. Scientifically, analysts still have controversies regarding how to calculate the emissions and how to choose the baseline and methodologies. Three methods are generally used, namely the 'bottom up' approach, the 'top down' approach and the STEEM, which produce very different results, leading to various papers with great uncertainties. This, in turn, results in great difficulties to policy makers who attempt to regulate the emissions. A recent technique, the STEEM, is intended to combine the former two methods to reduce their drawbacks. However, the regulations based on its results may increase the costs of shipping companies and cause the competitiveness of the port states and coastal states. Quite a few papers have focused on this area and provided another fresh perspective for the air emission to be incorporated in maritime transportation regulations; these facts deserve more attention. This paper is to review the literature on the debates over air emission calculation, with particular attention given to the STEEM and the refined estimation methods. It also reviews related literature on the economic analysis of maritime transportation emission regulations, and provides an insight into such analysis. At the end of this paper, based on a review and analysis of previous literature, we conclude with the policy indications in the future and work that should be done. As the related regulations in maritime transportation emissions are still at their beginning stage in China, this paper provides specific suggestions on how China should regulate emissions in the maritime transportation sector. © Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2009.

AB  - The structure and layout of an urban transportation network have decisive effects on urban logistics operation efficiency. The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

AB  - Based on the reliability of transportation time, a transportation assignment model of stochastic-flow freight network is designed in this paper. This transportation assignment model is built by mean of stochastic chance-constraint programming and solved with a hybrid intelligent algorithm (HIA) which integrates genetic algorithm (GA), stochastic simulation (SS) and neural network (NN). GA is employed to report the optimal solution as well as the optimal objective function values of the proposed model. SS is used to simulate the value of uncertain system reliability function. The uncertain function approximated via NN is embedded into GA to check the feasibility and to compute the fitness of the chromosomes. These conclusions have been drawn after a test of numerical case using the proposed formulations. System reliability, total system cost and flow on each path would finally reach at their own convergence points. Increase of the system reliability causes increase of the total time cost. The system reliability and the total time cost converge at a possible Nash Equilibrium point. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article analyzes the concept of logistics networks in the context of behavioral freight transport modeling. Starting from the basic definition of networks, the different perceptions of networks in transportation science and logistics are worked out. The micro–macro gap, as a main challenge in freight transport modeling, is explained by the existence of logistics networks on a meso level. A taxonomy of modeling methods dealing with logistics networks is defined, based on two characteristics: the changeability of networks within models (fixed, partially variable and variable networks) and the form of cost functions mapped (economies of scale, constant average cost, and diseconomies of scale). For each category, different possible modeling methods and their application in existing freight transport models are discussed. A special focus is placed on methodologies and models that map variable networks.

AB  - Non-human primates exhibit similar physiological and behavioral responses to anxiety-inducing situations as humans and have, in fact, been successfully employed in both conditioned (i.e. conflict paradigms) and ethologically based tests of fear/anxiety (i.e. involuntary isolation, social interaction, human threat, predator confrontation). In the last decade, a renewed and growing interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of the small callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety, addressing their advantages, shortcomings, and conceptual framework on which they are based. Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and fear-induced avoidance in callitrichids--the marmoset predator confrontation test--is discussed.

AB  - The fact that closed timelike curves (CTCs) are permitted by general relativity raises the question as to how quantum systems behave when time travel to the past occurs. Research into answering this question by utilising the quantum circuit formalism has given rise to two theories: D-CTCs and P-CTCs. In this paper the quantum circuit approach is thoroughly reviewed, and the strengths and shortcomings of D-CTCs and P-CTCs are presented in view of their non-linearity and time travel paradoxes. In particular, the "equivalent circuit model"---which aims to make equivalent predictions to D-CTCs, while avoiding some of the difficulties of the original theory---is shown to contain errors. The discussion of D-CTCs and P-CTCs is used to motivate an analysis of the features one might require of a theory of quantum time travel, following which two overlapping classes of new theories are identified. One such theory, the theory of T-CTCs, is fully developed. The theory of T-CTCs is shown not to have undesirable features---such as time travel paradoxes, the ability to distinguish non-orthogonal states, and the ability to clone or delete arbitrary pure states---that are present with D-CTCs and P-CTCs. The problems with non-linear extensions to quantum mechanics are discussed in relation to the interpretation of these theories, and the physical motivations of all three theories are discussed and compared.

AB  - Should we invest in all the transportation projects with positive net present value (NPV)? This paper builds upon a model to assist the social planner to optimally invest on the growth of the transportation network and demonstrates the answer to this question is no. The initial model, based on the Williams’ model (1) is an extension of the real option theory to the investment in transportation projects. Subject to technical, social and environmental limitations, which lead to a certain level of quality, the social planner may determine both the date and the capacity at which to improve the transportation network. The value of development of transportation projects as real options is based on the stochastic processes for the social operating revenues (including externalities) and the construction costs. After this, the initial model is modified by defining a generalized diffusion process for the state variable “ratio of social operating revenues over construction costs” that accounts for mean-reversion. The improved model allows the process of the only state variable to describe real transportation finance cases much better than the initial model because its drift is not constant but reverting to the mean of the process. Closed form analytic solutions for both the initial and the improved models are found and discussed.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

AB  - Optimal network design for transportation corridors of regional space groups is studied by using combinatorial optimization. The optimal investment model of multimodal transportation corridors is formulated by establishing supply capacity constraint and travel time constraint of transportation corridors. The unit investment cost and the length of transportation corridors is synthetically considered in the model. A method is designed by considering the characteristics of multimodal transportation corridors and the network structure of regional groups, and computational schemes are provided. The efficiency of solution is improved by using a genetic algorithm for large number of nodes. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model and the algorithm is verified through examples, which indicate that the optimal investment scheme is identified to meet transportation demands for planning and the average travel time of each transportation mode. The relationship between transportation demands and transportation corridor design is analyzed, and the results indicate that the model and the solution could be a promising approach to improving the traffic investment programs.

AB  - One controversy in the study of civil war relates to the role that institutions play in polarized societies. Constitutional engineers advance various institutional arrangements, ranging from democracy in general to specific constitutional and electoral rules, as those mechanisms that help divided societies to resolve disputes peacefully. Political sociologists, by contrast, maintain that political institutions are largely an epiphenomenon. We synthesize the two contending views and show that the impact of polarization on the risk of war differs across political systems. While ethnic dominance increases the risk of conflict in democracies, it works in the opposite direction in autocracies. Although ethnically diverse societies are less likely to be democratic, the rules that democracies rely upon make a difference. Controlling for the possible endogenity of these institutions, we demonstrate that there is indeed scope for constitutional engineering. As the institutionalist hypotheses let us expect, proportional representation, federalism, and presidentialism are associated with a lower risk of conflict. As recent research on political violence in India suggests, the effective number of parties exhibits a curvilinear relationship with the probability of civil war.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

Although animal models of viral hepatitis are a prerequisite for the evaluation of antiviral and vaccine efficacy, the restricted host range of HCV has hampered the development of a suitable small animal model of HCV infection. Use of the chimpanzee, the only animal known to be susceptible to HCV infection, is limited by ethical and financial restrictions. In this regard GBV-B, being closely related to HCV, appears to be a promising non-human surrogate model for the study of HCV infection.

AB  - In this paper, we present TimeArr, a new storage manager for an array database. TimeArr supports the creation of a sequence of versions of each stored array and their exploration through two types of time travel operations: selection of a specific version of a (sub)-array and a more general extraction of a (sub)-array history, in the form of a series of (sub)-array versions. TimeArr contributes a combination of array-specific storage techniques to efficiently support these operations. To speed-up array exploration, TimeArr further introduces two additional techniques. The first is the notion of approximate time travel with two types of operations: approximate version selection and approximate history. For these operations, users can tune the degree of approximation tolerable and thus trade-off accuracy and performance in a principled manner. The second is to lazily create short connections, called skip links, between the same (sub)-arrays at different versions with similar data patterns to speed up the selection of a specific version. We implement TimeArr within the SciDB array processing engine and demonstrate its performance through experiments on two real datasets from the astronomy and earth sciences domains.

AB  - GM production is up, but that doesn't mean Latin Americans like or want it, say Luisa Massarani, Ildeu de Castro Moreira and  Ana Maria Vara*.\n\nA report launched by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) in March 2010 paints a rosy picture of small-scale farmers embracing — and benefitting from — genetic modification (GM) technology at a rapid pace (see GM crops flourishing in developing world, says report).\n\nBut recent research from China shows that wide planting of GM cotton has caused a surge in pests (see Bt cotton linked with surge in crop pest).\n\nOur experience in Brazil and Argentina — both among the world's top producers of GM crops — similarly indicates that growth in GM crop production has guaranteed neither wide-scale social acceptance of the technology nor benefits for small-scale farmers.\n\nEarly acclaim\n\nIt is true that when, in the late 1990s, international agribusiness Monsanto introduced Argentina to Roundup Ready soya (a crop designed to tolerate the herbicide glyphosate), politicians and many commercialfarmers welcomed it with open arms.\n\nVery early on, multinational corporations and farmers' associations began an intense promotional campaign for GM crops, trading on the country's view of itself as a leading grain producer.\n\nJust one government office was responsible for GM crops, and this helped ensure the legal system didn't pose any obstacles. In fact, the issue of GM food was never really put up for public debate.\n\nAnd Monsanto's GM soya arrived in Argentina when the country was entering a major economic crisis, and agricultural income was badly needed.\n\nThere were other favourable economic factors too. Monsanto didn't have a monopoly over the technology because it could not patent its Roundup Ready soya in Argentina. Also, glyphosate was no longer under patent; field machinery was easily accessible under contract; and to GM needed less field labour compared with non-GM soya.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, GM soya was highly profitable, especially when combined with non-till practices and an increase in agro-chemical use. All these factors contributed GM soya's rapid penetration into Argentinean agriculture.\n\nBut our interviews and focus groups with about 50 Argentinean small-scale farmers in 2007revealed concern about the social changes the switch to GM soya causes. GM profits for many came not from growing the crop themselves, but from renting their land to commercial farmers for large-scale production.\n\nThis threatens sustainability because it increases small-scale farmers' reliance on external parties for their income, and can also mean both agricultural skills and land fertility are lost.\n\nBattle for Brazil\n\nIn Brazil, the opposition to GM crops has been much more overt, with Monsanto's move to introduce Roundup Ready soya sparking almost a decade of controversies and legal disputes.\n\nAs early as 1998the Worker's Party — the main opposition party at the time— adopted an anti-GM stance. Some state governments too, for example in Rio Grande do Sul and Paraná, ideologically opposed GM crops and even implemented local legislation to prohibit them.\n\nEnvironmental groupsand social movements, such as Greenpeace and the Movement of the Landless Rural Workers, also took up anti-GM positions and were much more vocal and active in campaigning against GM crops than their Argentinean counterparts.\n\nAnd if political divisions have characterised the GM debate in Brazil, so too have divisions within the scientific community.\n\nThe community generally supported research into GM crops. The Brazilian Academy of Science also supported growing them. But several prominent scientists, including Glaci Zancan, then president of the Brazilian Association for the Advancement of Science, opposed commercial GM crops in the absence of long-term studies on health and environmental impacts.  \n\nOvercoming opposition\n\nDespite the controversy and criticism, GM crop cultivation has expanded rapidly in Brazil, even before it was legally approved in 2005. Our focus groups and individual interviews with about 80 Brazilian stakeholders and approximately 200 small-scale farmers reveal many reasons for this growth.\n\nThey include the use of non-approved GM seeds illegally brought over from Argentina; a curiosity for testing new seeds; pressures to keep the harvest as economically productive as possible; and the fact that, in some regions, conventional soya seeds are becoming hard to find.\n\nBut more important than these factors has been the clever tactics employed by the pro-GM lobby, which even include — according to some of our interviewees — doling out free GM seeds.\n\nThe most significant move was the tactic that got GM soya legalised in 2005. The pro-GM lobby got the issue of stem cell research onto the same bill as GM soya — the biosafety law. This move capitalised on the much broader support among politicians, scientists and the public for stem cell research.\n\nThe strategy worked — the bill was passed by parliament by 352 votes to 60, and officially enabled the production and sale of GM soya in Brazil.\n\nBut the debate is far from over. There are still strong tensions around GM within government, and small-scale farmers remain unconvinced. Our research found a strong demand for unbiased information on GM crops and three national surveys also found a lack of acceptance of GM crops, even among farmers growing GM soya. Indeed, a common refrain among those we interviewed was "I'm happy to grow it, but I wouldn't eat it".\n\nIn Latin America, as in many developing regions of the world, the GM debate is 'messy'. There is a danger in interpreting a simple increase in GM crop cultivation as a sign that countries are wholeheartedly in favour of the technology, or that acceptance and benefits are widespread.\n\nLuisa Massarani is Latin America and Caribbean coordinator for SciDev.Net and researcher at Museum of Life, House of Oswaldo Cruz, Fiocruz, Brazil.\n\nIldeu de Castro Moreira is a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nAna Maria Vara is a researcher at the National University of San Martín, Argentina.\n\n*The authors thank Carla Almeida and Fabio Gouveia for their contributions to both this article and the research project it mentions, which was supported by the International Development Research Centre

The aim of this study was to find a relationship between the mechanical strength of an intact radius and ulna forearm and its collateral isolated radius and isolated ulna which would be of assistance in the studies on mechanical bone strength and bone healing. The findings include: (1) bone strength is significantly influenced by factors such as age, sex, and body weight; (2) wide variation in normal bone-tissue strength exists among similar individuals; (3) there are differences in bone strength in the same individual if contralateral sides are compared; (4) growing bones are very elastic and are able to bend to an angle of up to 90 degrees before a fracture occurs; (5) soft tissue structures (such as muscle, interosseous membrane, and tendons) do not contribute to the strength of a diaphysis in low velocity injuries; and (6) the midshaft area of the radius is approximately 10% stronger than that of the ulna in the adult.

The potential of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped. Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining of transportation network graphs: we hope to find how current techniques both succeed and fail on this problem, and from the failures, we hope to present new challenges for data mining. Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data mining techniques to real transportation network data are provided, including new approaches to making these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are not appropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate research and galvanize future work in this area.

Further, the capacity to recall the past and imagine one's self in the future (mental time travel) can influence social problem solving. We examined whether manipulating self-identity, through an induction task in which students were led to believe they possessed high or low self-efficacy, impacted episodic specificity and content of retrieved and imagined events, as well as social problem solving. Compared to individuals in the low self efficacy group, individuals in the high self efficacy group generated past and future events with greater (a) specificity, (b) positive words, and (c) self-efficacious statements, and also performed better on social problem solving indices. A lack of episodic detail for future events predicted poorer performance on social problem solving tasks. Strategies that increase perceived self-efficacy may help individuals to selectively construct a past and future that aids in negotiating social problems

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - Pre-school children expect falling objects to travel in a straight line even when there are clear physical mechanisms that deviate the object's path (Hood, 1995). The current study set out to determine whether this expectancy is limited to humans. Cotton-top tamarins ( Saguinus oedipus oedipus ), a New World monkey species, were tested on B. M. Hood's (1995) experimental task where objects are dropped down a chimney connected by an opaque tube to 1 of 3 containers. Like human children, there was a significant tendency to search in the container underneath the chimney where the food was dropped on the first trial, even though aligned chimneys and containers were never connected. These search errors suggest that there may be a gravity bias that operates when both primate species fail to understand the constraints operating on object trajectories. Unlike human children, however, tamarins were generally more likely to perseverate in making errors even though repeated testing and cost incentives were used.

Pedestrians were dressed in black, white, or blue clothing to produce varying levels of contrast with their surroundings. Detection and recognition testing took place in clear weather, rain, snow, and fog conditions. Project research also evaluated a subset of the VESs for their effect on drivers’ disability and discomfort glare. The VESs were also tested for their value in facilitating drivers’ detection of pavement markings and other traffic control devices. The results indicated that supplemental ultraviolet headlamps do not provide sufficient benefit to justify further testing; however, supplemental infrared vision enhancement systems do offer an improvement over headlamps alone for detection of pedestrians. Near infrared systems have the potential to provide an added benefit in detecting pedestrians in inclement weather, but the implementation of NIR technology is the key to achieving this benefit.

AB  - Although epidemiology is increasingly contributing to policy debates on issues of conflict and human rights, its potential is still underutilized. As a result, this article calls for greater collaboration between public health researchers, conflict analysts and human rights monitors, with special emphasis on retrospective, population-based surveys. The article surveys relevant recent public health research, explains why collaboration is useful, and outlines possible future research scenarios, including those pertaining to the indirect and long-term consequences of conflict; human rights and security in conflict prone areas; and the link between human rights, conflict, and International Humanitarian Law.

AB  - The principle of resource allocation states that resources are not sufficient to fully supply the demands of all plant functions. If resources are limited, allocation to reproduction must decrease the allocation to some other plant functions. Allocation of resources to reproduction (reproductive allocation) has implications for several study fields in biology. Early studies discussed allocation patterns in light of the evolution of life-history traits and interaction between life-history traits and population dynamics. Initial studies considered animals, but the idea was soon applied to plant ecology to explain how allocation affects plant life-history strategies and plant community dynamics. To test the principle of allocation, biologists have tried to measure the resource use of different plant functions. This task has turned out to be difficult. It is not clear which currency should be used to measure reproductive allocation. Meristems have been proposed as a currency to measure reproductive allocation. Meristems come as distinct reproductive or vegetative entities. This chapter aims to discuss whether meristem allocation can be used as a supplement or a substitute when studying reproductive allocation. It first describes the structural, developmental, and physiological background of the meristem system. It then uses a modeling approach to show theoretically how meristem allocation may affect fitness. It discusses model assumptions and reviews empirical studies that have tested allocation models and their assumptions. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Non-human primates exhibit similar physiological and behavioral responses to anxiety-inducing situations as humans and have, in fact, been successfully employed in both conditioned (i.e. conflict paradigms) and ethologically based tests of fear/anxiety (i.e. involuntary isolation, social interaction, human threat, predator confrontation). In the last decade, a renewed and growing interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of the small callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety, addressing their advantages, shortcomings, and conceptual framework on which they are based. Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and fear-induced avoidance in callitrichids--the marmoset predator confrontation test--is discussed.

AB  - This paper investigates geometric and algorithmic properties of the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane. In the presence of a transportation network, the distance is measured as the length of the shortest (time) path. In doing so, we introduce a needle, a generalized Voronoi site. We present an O(nm2 + m3 + nm log n) algorithm to compute the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane, where n is the number of given sites and m is the complexity of the given transportation network. Moreover, in the case that the roads in a transportation network have only a constant number of directions and speeds, we propose two algorithms; one needs O(nm + m2 + n log n) time with O(m(n + m)) space and the other O(nm log n + m2 log m) time with O(n + m) space. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Here we describe a new non-human primate model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) to better investigate the cause/effect relationships of human TLE. Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult marmosets by pilocarpine injection (250. mg/kg; i.p.). The animals were divided in 2 groups: acute (8. h post-SE) and chronic (3 and 5 months post-SE). To manage the severity of SE, animals received diazepam 5. min after the SE onset (acute group: 2.5 or 1.25. mg/kg; i.p.; chronic group/; 1.25. mg/kg; i.p). All animals were monitored by video and electrocorticography to assess SE and subsequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). To evaluate brain injury produced by SE or SRS we used argyrophil III, Nissl and neo-Timm staining techniques. Magnetic resonance image was also performed in the chronic group. We observed that pilocarpine was able to induce SE followed by SRS after a variable period of time. Prolonged SE episodes were associated with brain damage, mostly confined to the hippocampus and limbic structures. Similar to human TLE, anatomical disruption of dentate gyrus was observed after SRS. Our data suggest that pilocarpine marmoset model of epilepsy has great resemblance to human TLE, and could provide new tools to further evaluate the subtle changes associated with human epilepsy. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Decision making in both animals and humans is influenced by the anticipation of reward and/or punishment. Little is known about how reward and punishment interact in the context of decision making. The Avoidance-Reward Conflict (ARC) Task is a new paradigm that varies the degree of reward and the probability of punishment in a single paradigm that can be used in both non-human primates (NHPs) and humans. This study examined the behavioral pattern in the ARC task in both NHPs and humans. Two adult male NHPs (macaca mulatta) and 20 healthy human volunteers (12 females) participated in the ARC task. NHPs and humans perform similarly on the ARC task. With a high probability of punishment (an aversive air puff to the eye), both NHPs and humans are more likely to forgo reward if it is small or medium magnitude than when it is large. Both NHPs and humans perform similarly on the same behavioral task suggesting the reliability of animal models in predicting human behavior.

AB  - This study presents an analytical model of budget allocation into military and civilian expenditures within an arms race between two rival countries and compares the consequences of shortsighted (period-by-period) planning versus forward-looking (long-term) planning. The authors show that although shortsighted planning is favorable for both countries, they are likely to be locked in a prisoner’s dilemma in which both overinvest in arms procurement. The likelihood of overinvestment in arms procurement is higher when the perceived benefit from security is higher and when future benefits from existing arms stocks are ‘‘high’’; that is, when the rate of technology improvement over time is lower, the depreciation rate of existing arms is lower and the discount factor is higher. A dynamic version of Kagan et al., employing real-world data, finds evidence for the existence of a prisoner’s dilemma in the Israeli—Syrian arms race.

AB  - Studies exploring mental time travel commonly use cue-word paradigms to elicit past and future autobiographical events. However, the effect of trial duration (how long participants are allowed to describe events) on the relationship between episodic and nonepisodic detail and episodic specificity (i.e., whether longer durations increase event specificity) has not been examined. To resolve these issues, a cue-word study was devised whereby participants described past and future events under three randomly administered time constraints: short (1-min), standard (3-min), and long (5-min) durations. Findings indicated that an individual's capacity for episodic and nonepisodic thought for the past and future were unrelated. This lends supports to the idea that independent mechanisms are responsible for episodic and semantic information. This study also offers clarity concerning the effect of different trial durations on episodic specificity, which may aid the design of future studies of mental time travel.

Usually, these opportunities (projects) are evaluated for economic feasibility, and then the favorable ones pursued. Several questions arise regarding the allocation of available resources to the approved projects: In which order should the projects be done, or should they be done concurrently? How many resources should be assigned to each project? Given the multitude of factors affecting such decisions, one would expect complex formulas to describe the optimal allocation of resources. Contrary to expectations, the formulas describing optimal allocation are intelligible and practical in use.

In this paper, we focused on presenting the influences of vendorpsilas limited transportation capacity on replenishment and dispatching policies in vendor-managed inventory systems. Following the classical VMI model from Cetinkaya and Lee, we model the problem with transportation capacity, and numerical simulation method is employed to show the important influence of considering the limited transportation resource of the vendor.

AB  - The China sustainable development is the simultaneously three key facets, including urbanism, industrialization, and information. Building a Smart Low-carbon City is an energy strategy for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network (CIEN), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. CIEN starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). CIEN could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As CIEN is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the CIEN adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Army ant-following birds that inspect bivouacs (temporary nests of nomadic army ants) might provide a novel candidate for studying elements of mental time travel in animals, namely the ability to 1) remember the time and place of specific past events and 2) to use this memory to plan for future actions. Army ant colonies are a rich but unpredictable resource: Army ants do not raid every day, and colonies cycle through periods of high and low raid activity. Birds check bivouacs in the afternoon after feeding on insects that flee the army ant raids and then return to the bivouac the next morning to observe ant activity. If the ants are raiding, the birds will follow the army ants to the front of the raid and begin feeding; if not, the birds must move on to another army ant colony. Do ant-following birds check bivouacs to encode the location in their memory, thereby allowing them to return the next morning to feed again? Ant-following birds may track multiple army ant colonies through space and time to ensure a daily meal on an otherwise scattered and unpredictable resource.We suggest further research to test this hypothesis and provide a framework for investigating whether or not cognitive processes involved in mental time travel play a role in bivouac- checking behavior observed in the field.

The wide immunological gap between human beings and laboratory mouse or rat models makes many disease models in these species invalid. In this review, we report a non-human-primate model of chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) - experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) - that can help bridge this wide gap. The genetic and immunological similarity of marmosets and human beings and the clinical and neuropathological similarity of the EAE model to MS provide a unique experimental platform for research into basic immunopathogenetic mechanisms and for the development of more effective treatments for MS.

AB  - The performance of freely moving rats (n=18) in a decision-making reaction time task was analyzed to provide data that can be compared with noise-compatibility paradigms previously obtained in humans. Rats were first trained in an auditory pitch discrimination task involving a Go/Nogo response choice. In a subsequent phase, the two tones used in the previous phase were simultaneously presented in different combinations from two locations. Only the presence of the correct tone from the correct location was predictive of the reward. The observed behavioral strategies suggest a competition between two processes: one involving stimulus evaluation, response preparation and execution, the other involving recognition of the stimulus features associated with inhibition of the Go-response. The reaction times in the most adopted strategies towards the end of the experiment suggest an effect of stimulus congruence. Perceptual processes are affected by the congruence of 'pitch' and 'location' stimulus dimensions and the duration of the response may, but need not, be affected by overlapping dimensions. The analysis of error and aborted trials also suggest that subject's reaction and subsequent motor action may depend on whether stimulus identification processes can pass information to the response activation system prior to completion of sensory processing. The data are discussed in the framework of processing stages theory and dimensional overlap model. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

We evaluate the relevance of the alternative theories of budget allocation using the Arellanoâ€“Bond dynamic panel technique. Our results confirm our presumption that Federal funds allocations are dominated by the Executive and the governors while the Congress plays a minor role. Unlike some findings for the US, neither the overrepresentation variables nor the congressional theories find support in our sample. Our paper fills the gap in the literature on Argentinaâ€™s fiscal federalism deficient in analysis of the decision making process of the National Budget.

AB  - Having not considered such aspects as spatial distribution features of transportation networks and resident areas, the spatial influence of outside transportation modes on the features within the research regions as well as the different transit capacity of different transportation ways, the conventional measuring methods based on path analysis and network analysis are deficient to the description of regional transportation situation. With the employment and optimization of the connectivity and accessibility of the network nodes to evaluate transportation network, this study successfully breaks through the limitation of the border of investigative area and, different transportation modes can also be taken into account. Based on the gradually increased correlation coefficient between the connectivity change, which is a gradually increased process from direct connections to indirect multi-steps connections, and the development of regional economy, this paper proposes economy-network diameter index (ENDI), which is employed to evaluate the development of network and the contribution to regional economy of Gansu Province, china with the data of 2002 transportation network and the economic statistics in the Statistical Yearbook. By above methods, this empirical study comes to the following conclusions: 1) interregional transportation contributes more to the development of regional economic than that of the adjoining transportation; and 2) these indices can be used to designate spatial interactional scopes of regional economy, and accordingly to provide powerful and scientific supports for the planning of regional transportation and economy; and 3) the accessibility figure of network nodes shows that transportation of Gansu Province takes on a phenomenon of high cluster and spatial autocorrelation; and 4) ENDI can also be used to create spatial weight matrix of spatial progress. As calculation of these indices is laborious, several efficient computational methods are developed. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - ABSTRACT    (added to the original) The addition of transportation capacity affects potentially all attributes of trips made by urban residents: time of day, destination, mode, route, and linking of trips. In the long run, added capacity may influence a household’s automobile ownership decision, residence, and job location choice, as well as firms’ location decisions. Neither primary growth effects nor the secondary trip effects of added capacity are thoroughly understood—determining the effect of added capacity is not at all a trivial task because it is concerned with intricately and dynamically interrelated system components: transportation supply system, land use, accessibility, and travel demand. This paper presents a review of theoretical and empirical results in the literature that shed light on the effect of added transportation capacity. Tentative findings include the following: Using existing origin–destination data appears to be a very cost-effective and expeditious approach to addressing the added capacity issue, but it can be better used with more elaborate statistical methods to test behavioral theories. There is no empirical indication that added capacity generates a significant volume of induced traffic. The standard sequential procedure is capable, in principle, of forecasting diverted, transferred, and shifted traffic, although actual practice may be less than ideal. Abbreviated application of the procedure, unwarranted attempts to transfer models and extrapolation of the models to inapplicable options are unfortunately present. A better understanding of trip timing decisions and trip chaining behavior is needed. Impacts on car ownership, residential and job location choice, and land use need to be better understood and incorporated into the forecasting procedure. More widespread use of panel surveys is encouraged.

AB  - This article contains the argument that the human ability to travel mentally in time constitutes a discontinuity between ourselves and other animals. Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. It is not an isolated module, but depends on the sophistication of other cognitive capacities, including self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception-knowledge relationship, and the ability to dissociate imagined mental states from one's present mental state. These capacities are also important aspects of so-called theory of mind, and they appear to mature in children at around age 4. Furthermore, mental time travel is generative, involving the combination and recombination of familiar elements, and in this respect may have been a precursor to language. Current evidence, although indirect or based on anecdote rather than on systematic study, suggests that nonhuman animals, including the great apes, are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. In contrast, mental time travel by humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning. Past and future events loom large in much of human thinking, giving rise to cultural, religious, and scientific concepts about origins, destiny, and time itself.

AB  - Travel forecasters need to process a wealth of information to properly inform their models on the demand side as well as on the supply side. In particular for the supply side, typically referred to as the network model, the information depth is significant, and it is necessary to import external data sources to avoid the unreasonable cost of data updates. The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) is in the process of a multi-year model upgrade project. An innovative approach has been used by DVRPC to develop detailed and accurate highway and transit networks from internet-published data sources. The street data is derived from OpenStreetMap (OSM), a crowd-sourced routable network. Transit data is derived from Google Transit Feed (GTFS), a data supply used by many internet applications related to public transportation. Both OSM and GTFS are considered a part of the “web 2.0”. Web 2.0 data is published on the internet and generated with active participation of internet users. The authors believe that DVRPC’s new network model is the first one in North-America built mainly on “web 2.0” data. The result is a forecasting network of high geographic detail that includes all street classes down to local neighborhood streets. Transit service with full operational detail is integrated in the street network. This paper describes DVRPC’s experience with the integration of web 2.0 data into a consistent network model and shares promising results of the ongoing calibration process. The cost and benefits of the use of web 2.0 data in travel forecasting networks are discussed.

AB  - A two-layer transportation network design model with three
objectives is introduced. The objectives are: the minimization of the
primary path length (or traveling time) from a predetermined starting
node to a predetermined terminus node; the minimization of the total
distance traversed by the demand to reach a node on the primary path;
and the minimization of the total network construction cost. The problem
is initially formulated as an integer linear programming model. A
combinatoric solution which would be suitable for small networks because
of the large size of the subtour breaking constraints is presented. The
method produces efficient solutions according to the objectives
mentioned above. The criteria of alternate transportation facilities,
environmental concerns, and socio-economic structure are included for
these efficient solutions. By using Zeleny's ideal point approach the
best compromise solution is then selected. The results of a numerical
example are also given. Some potential applications of the model include
the planning of a new highway or rapid transportation system and the
design of an energy distribution system

AB  - Recent studies have shown that column stores can outperform row stores significantly. This paper explores alternative approaches to extend column stores with versioning, i.e., time travel queries and the maintenance of historic data. On the one hand, adding versioning can actually simplify the design of a column store because it provides a solution for the implementation of updates, traditionally a weak point in the design of column stores. On the other hand, implementing a versioned column store is challenging because it imposes a two dimensional clustering problem: should the data be clustered by row or by version? This paper devises the details of three memory layouts: clustering by row, clustering by version, and hybrid clustering. Performance experiments demonstrate that all three approaches outperform a (traditional) versioned row store. The efficiency of these three memory layouts depends on the query and update workload. Furthermore, the performance experiments analyze the time-space tradeoff that can be made in the implementation of versioned column stores.

AB  - The sample average approximation approach to solving stochastic programs induces a sampling error, caused by replacing an expectation by a sample average, as well as an optimization error due to approximating the solution of the resulting sample average problem. We obtain estimators of an optimal solution and the optimal value of the original stochastic program after executing a finite number of iterations of an optimization algorithm applied to the sample average problem. We examine the convergence rate of the estimators as the computing budget tends to infinity, and we characterize the allocation policies that maximize the convergence rate in the case of sublinear, linear, and superlinear convergence regimes for the optimization algorithm.

Crocodiles still kill people in the Lake Nasser area in Egypt and within towns in Mozambique; leopards still kill sheep within 100 km of Cape Town, South Africa, and lions kill cattle around the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya. In terms of the scale of their impact on humans, it is the smaller animals, occurring in vast numbers, that have the greatest impact. The red locust has been responsible for famines across vast swathes of Africa for centuries. Annual losses of cereals caused by the red-billed quelea have been estimated at US$22 million (Bruggers and Elliott, 1989). In Gabon, the number of overall complaints about grasscutters far surpasses those relating to any other animal species, including the elephant (Lahm, 1996). However, the larger herbivores (elephants, buffalo and hippopotamus), large mammalian carnivores (lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas and wild dogs), and crocodiles are traditionally seen as the animals representing the greatest threat to humans and responsible for the majority of human-wildlife conflicts. This may be due to the fact that local communities often regard the large wild animals as government property, as was the case under previous colonial legislation, and therefore feel prohibited from dealing with the problem themselves (WWF SARPO, 2005). The impact of the activities of large mammals on farmers and their livelihoods is enormous and even traumatic when people are killed. These incidents are often newsworthy, and generally attract the attention of political representatives who demand action from governments.

AB  - The present event-related potential study investigated the correlates of decision making in relation to the amount of response conflict. In a gambling paradigm, response conflict was introduced by giving participants the option to either gamble or pass. Second, the odds and gains in each trial were manipulated to make the decision to gamble or pass determined or underdetermined. Underdetermined trials included an extra conflict. The N2 was modulated by the mere presence of conflict. In contrast to both conflict monitoring and inhibition theories for N2, these results suggest that an enhancement in N2 reflects the mere detection of conflicting alternatives. The P3 showed a fronto-central increase in amplitude in trials including two forms of response conflict compared to trials including only one conflict. These findings suggest that P3 reflects part of the conflict resolution processes.

On the leisurely periphery, the synergy that arises between entertainment demands and commercial driven developments of interactive 3D (i3D) computer games has pushed these technologies beyond the expectations of the Virtual Reality (VR) community. This phenomenal growth in useable technology and its proportionate decrease in price have benefited the applicability of VR which in turn, have made it more accessible for researchers wishing to harness its benefits. The last 10 years have seen a steady increase in the use of VR technology to restore, preserve, reconstruct, recreate, and visualise ancient sites, monuments and artefacts.

AB  - The goal of the air transportation system is to provide reliable, affordable, rapid transportation of people and goods. This service is achieved by the interaction between autonomous, distributed agents (e.g. airports, air traffic control and airlines) that operate under a high degree of uncertainty (e.g. weather, economy). As a consequence, the overall speed of and reliability of this mode of transportation is determined by the collective interaction between these agents and the impact of uncertainty in the system. This paper describes a methodology and the results of an analysis of the degree of uncertainty in trip time reliability on a single congested-hub to congested-hub route (Atlanta - Chicago O'Hare). The analysis identified that the actual gate-to-gate trip time varies by up to 30% of the average trip time. The analysis also identified systemic schedule padding of 16 minutes on this route, and statistically significant differences between the trip time in the summer, winter and fall/spring, between time-of-day, and between narrow-body and regional jets. The implications of these results on airlines strategies and passenger experience are discussed

AB  - Perturbation series are developed and mathematically justified, using a straightforward perturbation formalism (that is more widely applicable than those given in standard textbooks), for the case of the two-dimensional inviscid Orr-Sommerfeld-like eigenvalue problem describing quasi-geostrophic wave instabilities of parallel flows in rotating stratified fluids. The results are first used to examine the instability properties of the perturbed Eady problem, in which the zonal velocity profile has the form u = z + μu1(y, z) where, formally, μ [double less-than sign] 1. The connexion between baroclinic instability theories with and without short wave cutoffs is clarified. In particular, it is established rigorously that there is instability at short wavelengths in all cases for which such instability would be expected from the ‘critical layer’ argument of Bretherton. (Therefore the apparently conflicting results obtained earlier by Pedlosky are in error.) For the class of profiles of form u = z + μu1(y) it is then shown from an examination of the O(μ) eigenfunction correction why, under certain conditions, growing baroclinic waves will always produce a counter-gradient horizontal eddy flux of zonal momentum tending to reinforce the horizontal shear of such profiles. Finally, by computing a sufficient number of the higher corrections, this first-order result is shown to remain true, and its relationship to the actual rate of change of the mean flow is also displayed, for a particular jet-like form of profile with finite horizontal shear.

AB  - As interest in assetmanagementamong public sector organizations has grownover the past decade, a number of professional and government organizations have attempted to define asset management and develop research agendas in an effort to focus the practice and implementation of asset management. This article synthe- sizes these research initiatives to develop a research road map for transportation asset management. This road map is intended to identify research needs and pro- vide significant milestones along the way. The road map includes specific projects over a 15-year period in the areas of (a) policy goals and objectives and perfor- mance measures, (b) planning and programming, (c) program delivery, and (d) systems monitoring and performance results. Ultimately this research program aims to facilitate the widespread adoption of the assetmanagement concept and the continued enhancement of tools and processes.

AB  - Some of the actions taken during Minnesota's implementation of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) are summarized. The focus is on the development of area transportation partnerships (ATPs). The establishment of ATPs was a central tenet in the development of the first state transportation improvement program (STIP). This transportation investment process is but one model for the implementation of ISTEA and the development of a STIP. Minnesota introduced the concept of ATP as a substate, multicounty geographic basis for transportation investment decisions. The partnerships depend on cooperation between all modes and state and local transportation interests. ATPs consist of a combination of local elected officials, local transportation planning representatives, and state transportation officials. These officials work, where possible, through existing organizations, such as the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) districts, metropolitan planning organizations, and regional development organizations. The boundaries selected for the partnerships are based on the Mn/DOT state-aid districts, which respect county lines. The ATPs are responsible for integrating the priorities for highway and transit capital activities using federal aid for highways into a draft areawide transportation improvement program (ATIP). Draft ATIPs include a prioritized list of projects to aid in solving transportation problems and implementing the long-range objectives for the area. Each ATP is responsible for submitting an ATIP to Mn/DOT. Mn/DOT evaluates each ATIP for consistency, determines the appropriate funding level, and consolidates them into the STIP.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - The fitness consequences of hybridization critically affect the speciation process. When hybridization is costly, selection favors the evolution of prezygotic isolating mechanisms (e.g., mating behaviors) that reduce heterospecific matings and, consequently, enhance reproductive isolation between species (a process termed reinforcement). If, however, selection to avoid hybridization differs between species, reinforcement may be impeded. Here, we examined both the frequency and fitness effects of hybridization between plains spadefoot toads (Spea bombifrons) and New Mexico spadefoot toads (S. multiplicata). Hybridization was most frequent in smaller breeding ponds that tend to be ephemeral, and heterospecific pairs consisted almost entirely of S. bombifrons females and S. multiplicata males. Moreover, in controlled experimental crosses, hybrid offspring from crosses in which S. multiplicata was maternal had significantly lower survival and longer development time than pure S. multiplicata offspring. By contrast, hybrid offspring from crosses in which S. bombifrons was maternal outperformed pure S. bombifrons offspring by reaching metamorphosis faster. These data suggest that, although S. multiplicata females are under selection to avoid hybridization, selection might favor those S. bombifrons females that hybridize with S. multiplicata if their breeding pond is highly ephemeral. Generally, the strength of selection to avoid hybridization may differ for hybridizing species, possibly impeding reinforcement.

Non-human primates therefore provide important experimental models for disorders in the human population that are caused by the immune system, such as autoimmune diseases. In this paper we describe non-human primate models of multiple sclerosis, a chronic inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system. While reviewing data from the literature and our own research we will discuss the unique role of such models in the research of basic disease mechanisms and the development of new therapies.

AB  - Because of the existence of "limited designation" gateways, i.e., gateways for inter- national air travel whereentry by U.S. flag carriers is limited (in many cases to only one carrier), the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) has announced a policy of "gateway competition." This policy seeks to maximize inter-gateway competition as a goal of the carrier selection process. The paper reviews the rationale and history of this policy and the economic principles of gateway competition. After addressing exceptions where gate- way competition does not enhance competitive goals, the issue of how to enforce the credibility of the bidding process in route awards is addressed. The paper concludes by identifying circumstances where competitive objectives are not advanced through applica- tion of the principle gateway competition.

AB  - The dynamics of many systems in nowadays follow not only physical laws but also man-made rules. These systems are known as discrete event dynamic systems (DEDS's). Policy improvement of such systems is usually based on simulation, which is time consuming and provides only noisy performance evaluation. It is of great practical interest to understand how to allocate the computing budget among action candidates so that a better policy is found with high probability. Despite the abundant studies on simulation-based policy optimization, few consider this allocation problem. This paper considers this important problem. Based on the method of optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) in simulation-based optimization, an efficient allocation procedure is developed, which is shown to asymptotically maximize a lower bound of the probability of correctly selecting the best action. This allocation procedure is compared with equal allocation, which is well adopted in practice, on numerical examples. The numerical results show that even when there are only finite computing budget to allocate, this OCBA-based allocation procedure outperforms equal allocation and has good performance. We hope this work brings insight to computing budget allocation for simulation-based policy improvement in more general situations.

AB  - We develop a model of budget allocation for permanent and contingent workforce under stochastic demand. The level of permanent capacity is determined at the beginning of the horizon and is kept constant throughout, whereas the number of temporary workers to be hired must be decided in each period. Compared to existing budgeting models, this paper explicitly considers a budget constraint. Under the assumption of a restricted budget, the objective is to minimize capacity shortages. When over-expenditures are allowed, both budget deviations and shortage costs are to be minimized. The capacity shortage cost function is assumed to be either linear or quadratic with the amount of shortage, which corresponds to different market structures or different types of services. We thus examine four variants of the problem that we model and solve either approximately or to optimality when possible. A comprehensive experimental design is designed to analyze the behavior of our models when several levels of demand variability and parameter values are considered. The parameters consist of the initial budget level, the unit cost of temporary workers and the budget deviation penalty/reward rates. Varying these parameters produce several trade-offs between permanent and temporary workforce levels, and between capacity shortages and budget deviations. Numerical results also show that the quadratic cost function leads to smooth and moderate capacity shortages over the time periods, whereas all shortages are either avoided or accepted when the cost function is linear. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current models of autobiographical memory suggest that self-identity guides autobiographical memory retrieval. Further, the capacity to recall the past and imagine one's self in the future (mental time travel) can influence social problem solving. We examined whether manipulating self-identity, through an induction task in which students were led to believe they possessed high or low self-efficacy, impacted episodic specificity and content of retrieved and imagined events, as well as social problem solving. Compared to individuals in the low self efficacy group, individuals in the high self efficacy group generated past and future events with greater (a) specificity, (b) positive words, and (c) self-efficacious statements, and also performed better on social problem solving indices. A lack of episodic detail for future events predicted poorer performance on social problem solving tasks. Strategies that increase perceived self-efficacy may help individuals to selectively construct a past and future that aids in negotiating social problems.

AB  - This article contains the argument that the human ability to travel mentally in time constitutes a discontinuity between ourselves and other animals. Mental time travel comprises the mental reconstruction of personal events from the past (episodic memory) and the mental construction of possible events in the future. It is not an isolated module, but depends on the sophistication of other cognitive capacities, including self-awareness, meta-representation, mental attribution, understanding the perception-knowledge relationship, and the ability to dissociate imagined mental states from one's present mental state. These capacities are also important aspects of so-called theory of mind, and they appear to mature in children at around age 4. Furthermore, mental time travel is generative, involving the combination and recombination of familiar elements, and in this respect may have been a precursor to language. Current evidence, although indirect or based on anecdote rather than on systematic study, suggests that nonhuman animals, including the great apes, are confined to a "present" that is limited by their current drive states. In contrast, mental time travel by humans is relatively unconstrained and allows a more rapid and flexible adaptation to complex, changing environments than is afforded by instincts or conventional learning. Past and future events loom large in much of human thinking, giving rise to cultural, religious, and scientific concepts about origins, destiny, and time itself

AB  - Infrastructure resiliency, particularly related to transportation networks, is essential to any society, especially when considering natural (and man-made) disasters. Recent events around the globe, including Hurricane Katrina, as well as significant seismic events in Haiti, Chile and Japan, have increased the awareness and importance of this fact. Transportation systems are key to response and recovery. They must be able to withstand stress, maintaining baseline service levels, and be stout in physical design and operational concept in order to provide restoration to the system, thus preventing a destructive event from becoming the catalyst for a degenerative epoch. Analyzing the resiliency of a transportation network will aid decision-makers in identifying specific weaknesses within the network, thus allowing the proper prioritization of investments and improvement projects. This paper expands on previous research in quantifying network resiliency. Through the proposed methodology, properly understanding and applying network resiliency may preclude many of the devastating effects caused by destabilizing events, thus preserving quality of life and economic stability.

AB  - Ag-specific T cell activation requires a CD28-mediated costimulatory interaction. This observation has suggested novel approaches to suppress donor-specific immunity, including the use of soluble CD28 antagonists, such as CTLA4Ig, which suppresses transplant rejection in small animal models. In this study, CTLA4Ig therapy was examined in a non-human primate model of allogeneic pancreatic islet transplantation. Two of five CTLA4Ig-treated monkeys showed prolonged graft survival, which correlated with donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in vitro. Humoral responses to the transplanted tissue were suppressed in all treated animals. These results suggest that CTLA4Ig is effective in suppressing both humoral and cellular immune responses in a non-human primate model of allogeneic transplantation.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer service goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling e orts and mathematical programming developments for network design.

AB  - Unlike prospective time perception paradigms, in which participants are aware that they have to estimate forthcoming time, little is known about retrospective time perception in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our paper addresses this shortcoming by comparing prospective and retrospective time estimation in younger adults, older adults, and AD patients. In four prospective tasks (lasting 30. s, 60. s, 90. s, or 120. s) participants were asked to read a series of numbers and to provide a verbal estimation of the reading time. In four other retrospective tasks, they were not informed about time judgment until they were asked to provide a verbal estimation of four elapsed time intervals (lasting 30. s, 60. s, 90. s, or 120. s). AD participants gave shorter verbal time estimations than older adults and younger participants did, suggesting that time is perceived to pass quickly in these patients. For all participants, the duration of the retrospective tasks was underestimated as compared to the prospective tasks and both estimations were shorter than the real time interval. Prospective time estimation was further correlated with mental time travel, as measured with the Remember/Know paradigm. Mental time travel was even higher correlated with retrospective time estimation. Our findings shed light on the relationship between time perception and the ability to mentally project oneself into time, two skills contributing to human memory functioning. Finally, time perception deficits, as observed in AD patients, can be interpreted in terms of dramatic changes occurring in frontal lobes and hippocampus. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

More recently, a premature baboon model developed for evaluation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia has been applied to the investigation of cerebral development and injury, revealing high similarity in neuropathology to the premature human infant. Given the differences in the outcomes of neuroprotective therapies between lower order species, such as the rat, and human trials in disorders such as stroke, nonhuman primate models may provide an invaluable resource for safety and efficacy testing before trials in human newborns. This article summarizes both models of brain injury. The histologic findings from the models are compared with neuropathological studies in human infants.

AB  - Recent advances in computer processing speeds have resulted in a
parallel processing environment in which the interconnection networks
(INs) themselves are the limiting factor in terms of performance. Larger
and faster INs can be implemented optically subject to the current
limitation in the number of wavelengths imposed by optical switch and
filter technology if the INs are arranged hierarchically, i.e. if the
processing nodes are arranged in clusters and these clusters are
connected together special routing nodes at one or more higher levels.
HORN uses optically connected rings as the basic building blocks and
connects these rings using an optical tree. Three key issues facing HORN
are addressed in this paper: dynamic channel allocation (DCA), optical
power budget (OPE) and bit error rate (BER). Four approaches to DCA are
evaluated and a design trade-off is performed between them. The first
two are taken from the literature while the last two are proposed here
and exploit the multiple paths available in a hierarchical network. The
evaluation of OPE and BER shows that HORN is feasible and practical when
optical amplification is used at the initial signal insertion point for
transmissions at higher levels in the hierarchy

AB  - Viral hemorrhagic fevers are a group of disease syndromes caused by infection with certain RNA viruses. The disease is marked by a febrile response, malaise, coagulopathy and vascular permeability culminating in death. Case fatality rates can reach 90% depending on the etiologic agent. Currently, there is no approved antiviral treatment. Because of the high case fatality, risk of importation and the potential to use these agents as biological weapons, development of countermeasures to these agents is a high priority. The sporadic nature of disease outbreaks and the ethical issues associated with conducting a human trial for such diseases make human studies impractical; therefore, development of countermeasures must occur in relevant animal models. Non-human primates are superior models to study infectious disease because their immune system is similar to humans and they are good predictors of efficacy in vaccine development and other intervention strategies. This review article summarizes viral hemorrhagic fever non-human primate models.

AB  - Much attention has been paid on energy efficiency of routing protocols in wireless ad hoc networks. Since transmission or receiving of data packets and control packets will drain the energy which is powered by the batteries, designing energy efficient communication techniques is one of the most important challenges for wireless ad hoc networks. In this paper, we design an optimizing routing protocol ORE for enhancing energy efficiency with network coding in wireless ad hoc networks based on PEER protocol proposed in [I]. We incorporate the path accumulating characteristic and network coding technique to improve PEER protocol with the aim of achieving energy efficiency as much as possible. The results of simulation in both static scenarios and mobile scenarios show that ORE achieves better performance than the existing protocols.

AB  - Mental time travel is a futures research method using focused imagination in the "theater of the mind" to visualize and explore contingent future patterns. It is a practical approach for wise choosing, and represents a clear way to improve conventional scenario forecasting, strategic planning and marketing research methods-especially when dealing with just in time (JiT) business environments. The questions to be proactively explored in mental time travel can take many forms, depending on the purpose of the researcher and/or client. For example:???"What may happen if "X" (a decision or policy option) is chosen, versus is not chosen and implemented? In particular, how would it feel to live in each such contingent future????"Which of two policy options or possible decisions looks and feels better, "X" or "Y"????"In a future involving a specific scenario [specified in advance], what significant impacts are likely, but perhaps are as yet unrecognized?" How would such impacts feel? Furthermore, how might these impacts manifest at various levels of aggregation, such as individual, family, work group, subculture/ecology, global culture/ecology?. The purpose of this paper is to present a working set of ideas and methodological guidelines to enable professional futurists, market researchers and other professionals to try the method of Mental Time Travel for themselves and their clients. For the convenience of users new to this type of methodology, a "turn-key" script is appended to the main text. Assuming an appropriate set and setting, this script should be feasible to implement by any professional familiar with group facilitation methods. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tactical planning of operations is comprised of a set of interrelated decisions that aim to ensure an optimal allocation and utilization of resources to achieve the economic and customer sen ice goals of the company. Tactical planning is particularly vital for intercity freight carriers that make intensive use of consolidation operations. Railways and less-than-truckload motor carriers are typical examples of such systems. Service Network Design is increasingly used to designate the main tactical issues for this type of carriers: selection and scheduling of services, specification of terminal operations, routing of freight. The corresponding models usually take the form of network design formulations that are difficult to solve, except in the simplest of cases. The paper presents a state-of-the-art review of service network design modelling efforts and mathematical programming developments for network design.

AB  - As we experience a temporal flux of events our expectations of future events change. Such expectations seem to be central to our perception of affect in music, but we have little understanding of how expectations change as recent information is integrated. When music establishes a pitch centre (tonality), we rapidly learn to anticipate its continuation. What happens when anticipations are challenged by new events? Here we show that providing a melodic challenge to an established tonality leads to progressive changes in the impact of the features of the stimulus on listeners' expectations. The results demonstrate that retrospective analysis of recent events can establish new patterns of expectation that converge towards probabilistic interpretations of the temporal stream. These studies point to wider applications of understanding the impact of information flow on future prediction and its behavioural utility.

AB  - Most Namibian s depends on the land for their subsistence. But the presence of many species of large mammals, combined with settlement patterns of people, leads to conflict between people and wildlife. A balance is needed between forming systems of protected areas in Namibia and possibilities for community empowerment to manage and benefit form wildlife and other natural resources. Human wildlife Conflict (HWC) refers to conflict between wild animals and humans. This ranges from the destruction of crops and water installations to loss of livestock, homes and human life. Friction between park managers and neighboring communities living on the perimeters of protected areas potentially weakens the effectiveness of projects and programme, for example the conservancy programme. A stakeholder meeting was held in Windhoek in July 2001 to discuss mechanisms to reduce conflict between people and wildlife. Among decisions taken was to replace the term Problem animal with more appropriate term human wildlife conflict.

AB  - The present study examined neurochemical, morphological and functional markers of the nigrostriatal dopamine system in young, intermediate-aged and old squirrel monkeys. Striking reductions in motoric activity were observed with advancing age. significant age-related loss of dopamine occurred in the substantia nigra (70%) and the putamen (30%) but not in the caudate. There was a strong correlation between the reductions in motoric activity and the loss of putamen dopamine. However, nigrostriatal dopamine loss did not appear to be the consequence of age-related loss of dopaminergic nigral neurons since the number of tyrosine immunoreactive cells was not significantly different among the three age groups. These results suggest that the aging squirrel monkey demonstrates the age-related loss of nigrostriatal dopamine thought to occur in humans and identify this non-human primate as a useful model to further investigate the underlying mechanism(s) and functional consequences of age-related decline of the nigrostriatal dopamine system. In addition, the selective loss of dopamine in the putamen but not the caudate parallels the regional vulnerability observed in Parkinson's disease, an age-related neurodegenerative disorder, raising the possibility of a relationship between normal aging and the development of this disease. Finally, because the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells remains constant with age, these results raise the possibility that therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing dopamine concentrations may benefit elderly individuals.

AB  - To overcome the shortness of traditional weighted-sum method (WSM) for multi-objective optimization of freight flow allocation in logistics network, a variable weight method was proposed, in which the weights of optimization objectives are variable. The variable weights are determined by preset weights and state values of logistics network elements including the nodes, lines and paths. Those state values are obtained with a WSM based on the attribute values of the elements. The proposed method was applied to an optimization example of logistics network where the restraints are the capacities of transport lines and logistics nodes, and the objectives are the minimum logistics cost, shortest one-way delivery time, and the maximum utilization ratio of the logistics network.

AB  - The research presented in this paper develops a particle filter approach for the real-time short to medium-term travel time prediction using real-time and historical data. Given the challenges in defining the particle filter time update process, the proposed algorithm selects particles from a historical database and propagates particles using historical data sequences as opposed to using a state-transition model. A partial resampling strategy is then developed to address the degeneracy problem by replacing invalid or low weighted particles with historical data that provide similar data sequences to real-time traffic measurements. As a result, each particle generates a predicted travel time with a corresponding weight that represents the level of confidence in the prediction. Consequently, the prediction can produce a distribution of travel times by aggregating all weighted particles. A 95-mile freeway stretch from Richmond to Virginia Beach along I-64 and I-264 is used to test the proposed algorithm. Both the absolute and relative prediction errors using the leave-one-out cross validation concept demonstrate that the proposed method produces the least deviation from ground truth travel times, compared to instantaneous travel times, two Kalman filter algorithms and a K nearest neighbor (k-NN) method. Moreover, the maximum prediction error for the proposed method is the least of all the algorithms and maintains a stable performance for all test days. The confidence boundaries of the predicted travel times demonstrate that the proposed approach provides good accuracy in predicting travel time reliability. Lastly, the fast computation time and online processing ensure the method can be used in real-time applications. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cargo shipments are subject to hijack, theft, or tampering. Furthermore, cargo shipments are at risk of being used to transport contraband, potentially resulting in fines to shippers. The Transportation Security Sensor Network (TSSN), which is based on open software systems and service-oriented architecture principles, has been developed to mitigate these risks. Using commercial off-the-shelf hardware, the TSSN can detect and report events that are relevant to appropriate decision makers. However, field testing is required to validate the system architecture and to determine if the system can provide timely event notification. Field experiments were conducted to assess the TSSN's suitability to monitor rail-borne cargo. Log files were collected from these experiments and were postprocessed. We present the TSSN architecture and results of field experiments, including the time taken to report events using the TSSN and the interaction between various components of the TSSN. These results show that the TSSN architecture can be used to monitor rail-borne cargo.

AB  - The non-human primate is an important translational species for understanding the normal function and disease processes of the human brain. Unbiased stereology, the method accepted as state-of-the-art for quantification of biological objects in tissue sections, generates reliable structural data for biological features in the mammalian brain. The key components of the approach are unbiased (systematic-random) sampling of anatomically defined structures (reference spaces), combined with quantification of cell numbers and size, fiber and capillary lengths, surface areas, regional volumes and spatial distributions of biological objects within the reference space. Among the advantages of these stereological approaches over previous methods is the avoidance of all known sources of systematic (non-random) error arising from faulty assumptions and non-verifiable models. This study documents a biological application of computerized stereology to estimate the total neuronal population in the frontal cortex of the vervet monkey brain (Chlorocebus aethiops sabeus), with assistance from two commercially available stereology programs, BioQuant Life Sciences and Stereologer (Figure 1). In addition to contrast and comparison of results from both the BioQuant and Stereologer systems, this study provides a detailed protocol for the Stereologer system.

AB  - Human speech is based on rule-governed assemblage of morphemes into more complex vocal expressions. Free-ranging putty-nosed monkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) provide an interesting analogy, because males combine two loud alarm calls, 'hacks' and 'pyows', into different call series depending on external events [1]. Series consisting of 'pyows' are a common response to leopards, while 'hacks' or 'hacks' followed by 'pyows' are regularly given to crowned eagles [2,3]. Sometimes, males produce a further sequence, consisting of 1-4 'pyows' followed by 1-4 'hacks'. These 'pyow-hack' (P-H) sequences can occur alone, or they are inserted at or near the beginning of another call series. Regardless of context, P-H sequences reliably predict forthcoming group progression [4]. In playback experiments, we tested the monkeys' reactions to 'pyows', 'hacks' and P-H sequences and found that responses matched the natural conditions. Specifically, females started group progressions after hearing P-H sequences and responded appropriately to the other call series. In a second experiment, we tested artificially composed P-H sequences, and found that they were also effective in eliciting group progressions. In a third experiment, we established that group movement could only be triggered by the calls of the group's own male, not those of a stranger. We conclude that, in this primate, meaning is encoded by call sequences, not individual calls. Many birds and primates are limited by small vocal repertoires [5,6], and this constraint may have favored the evolution of such combinatorial signaling. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The responses to various stresses involved with cryopreservation protocols were investigated using non-human primate oocytes. Fluorescence microscopy was used to assess the status of the F-actin microfilament system of rhesus monkey oocytes after exposure to different concentrations of glycerol. The F-actin organization around the cortex and in the transzonal processes was modified by exposure to 1.0 ot 2.0 M glycerol at ambient temperature. These effects were reduced significantly when exposure to glycerol was combined with cooling to O degrees C. Cynomolgus monkey oocytes were also subjected to hyperosmotic stress and observed for morphological changes. An irregular shrinkage phenomenon was observed with germinal vesicle or metaphase I but not metaphase II (MII) oocytes. The irregular shrinkage became uniform and spherical when the oocytes were pretreated with ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N,N'N' tetraacetic acid (EGTA) before exposure to hypertonic solution. Also, in-vitro-matured MII oocytes from cynomolgus monkeys were used to determine crucial biophysical parameters for freezing primate oocytes. The permeability of oocyte plasma membrane to water, Lpg, and its activation energy, ELp, were determined between 0 and -12 degrees C in the absence of cryoprotective additives. The Lpg was found to be 3.8x10(-14) m3N/s and the ELp was 141.5 kJ/mol. the pre-exponential kinetic and exponential thermodynamic parameters of intracellular ice formation were determined to be 8x108 m2/S and 2. 2x10(9) K5 respectively. By combining models of water transport and intracellular ice formation, the cumulative fraction of oocytes with intracellular ice as a function of the cooling rate was also predicted, and it was shown to correlate reasonably with experimental observations.

This 500-page+ document is a comprehensive study of transportation benefit and costing research, and a guidebook for applying this information in planning and policy analysis. This document is unique in several important ways. It is one of the most comprehensive studies of its type, including many categories of costs and benefits that are often overlooked, and the only one that is regularly expanded and updated as new information becomes available. It provides extensive reference information, mostly available through the Internet, allowing users to obtain additional information when needed. It explains economic evaluation techniques and how to apply them. It is the only study that provides costs values in a format designed to easily calculate the full costs and benefits of transportation policy and planning alternatives. Individual chapters include detailed information on various categories of transportation costs and benefits, including summaries of previous monetized estimates. Using the best available data, it provides monetized estimates of twenty costs for eleven travel modes under three travel conditions. Costs are categorized according to various attributes: whether they are internal or external, fixed or variable, market or nonmarket. Examples illustrate how this information can be applied for transportation policy and planning decisions. The Guidebook also summarizes previous transportation impact studies, describes how nonmarket impacts are estimated, discusses major findings, evaluates criticisms of transportation costing, and explores implications and applications of this research. We regularly update and revise the Guidebook. Please let us know if you have comments or suggestions for improving this information.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptor has been associated with functions of the gastrointestinal tract such as modulation of the peristaltic reflex, smooth muscle tone, intestinal secretion and visceral sensitivity. The activation of peripheral 5-HT4 receptors with agonists such as tegaserod has been shown to accelerate gastric emptying and improve symptoms of constipation in animals and humans. However, detailed data on the expression profile and on the localization of this receptor subtype are lacking so far. OBJECTIVE: To study the pattern and expression levels of 5-HT4 receptor messenger RNA expression in the gut. METHOD: Normal tissue samples were collected from the whole gastrointestinal tract of patients undergoing abdominal surgery and, in addition, of monkeys. We performed a comprehensive analysis of 5-HT4 receptor expression by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, using human and non-human primate tissues from the oesophagus to the rectum. In addition, the brain and heart of non-human primates were analysed. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of 5-HT4 receptor mRNA were measured in the human stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum and caecum and also in the corresponding non-human primate gut segments, ranging from 2- to 12-fold compared with the liver. No differences were found between females and males of both human and non-human primates. CONCLUSIONS: These results show 5-HT4 receptor mRNA expression throughout the gastrointestinal tract in humans and primates, and also support the preclinical and clinical findings of 5-HT4 receptors ligands exhibiting multiple effects throughout the gastrointestinal tract.

The purpose of the present study was to confirm this proposition by examining whether the relationship observed between personality and episodic memory could be extended to episodic future thinking and, more generally, to investigate the influence of personality traits on self-information processing in the past and in the future. Results show that Neuroticism and Harm Avoidance predict more negative past memories and future projections. Other personality dimensions exhibit a more limited influence on mental time travel (MTT). Therefore, our study provide an additional evidence to the idea that MTT into the past and into the future rely on a common set of processes by which past experiences are used to envision the future. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The memory theorist Endel Tulving referred to the ability to search through one's memories, and revisit events and episodes from one's past, as mental time travel. This process involves the reactivation of past mental states reflecting the perceptual and conceptual characteristics of the original experience. Widely distributed neural circuitry is engaged in the service of memory search, and the dynamics of these circuits are reflected in rhythmic oscillatory signals at widespread frequencies, recorded both in the local field around neurons and more globally at the scalp. Retrieved-context theory provides a theoretical bridge between the behavioral phenomena exhibited by participants in memory search tasks, and the neural signals reflecting the dynamics of the underlying circuitry. Computational models based on this theory make broad predictions regarding the representational structure of neural activity recorded during these tasks. In recent work, researchers have used multivariate analytic techniques on topographic patterns of oscillatory neural activity to confirm critical predictions of retrieved-context theory. We review the cognitive theory motivating this recent work, and the analytic techniques being developed to create integrated neural-behavioral models of human memory search. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Widely distributed neural circuitry is engaged in the service of memory search, and the dynamics of these circuits are reflected in rhythmic oscillatory signals at widespread frequencies, recorded both in the local field around neurons and more globally at the scalp. Retrieved-context theory provides a theoretical bridge between the behavioral phenomena exhibited by participants in memory search tasks, and the neural signals reflecting the dynamics of the underlying circuitry. Computational models based on this theory make broad predictions regarding the representational structure of neural activity recorded during these tasks. In recent work, researchers have used multivariate analytic techniques on topographic patterns of oscillatory neural activity to confirm critical predictions of retrieved-context theory. We review the cognitive theory motivating this recent work, and the analytic techniques being developed to create integrated neural-behavioral models of human memory search. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We present an approach to systematically analyzing the vulnerability\nof road networks under\n\ndisruptions covering extended areas. Since various kinds of events\nincluding floods, heavy\n\nsnowfall, storms and wildfires can cause such spatially spread degradations,\nthe analysis method is\n\nan important complement to the existing studies of single link failures.\nThe methodology involves\n\ncovering the study area with grids of uniformly shaped and sized cells,\nwhere each cell represents\n\nthe extent of an event disrupting any intersecting links. We apply\nthe approach to the Swedish\n\nroad network using travel demand and network data from the Swedish\ntransport modeling system\n\nSampers. Among other things, the study shows that the impacts of area-covering\ndisruptions are\n\nlargely determined by the level of internal, outbound and inbound\ntravel demand of the affected\n\narea itself. This is unlike single link failures, where the link flow\nand the redundancy in the\n\nsurrounding network determine the impacts. As a result, the vulnerability\nto spatially spread\n\nevents shows a markedly different geographical distribution. These\nfindings, which should be\n\nuniversal for most road networks of similar scale, are important in\nthe planning process of\n\nresource allocation for mitigation and recovery.

AB  - Key Points Post-Soviet Russia has no official ideology. However all political systems require an ideology, just as nature requires air. Political stability since 2000 has now led to discussion about ideology in the pro-Putin party of power, Yedinaya Rossiya (YR). Deputy head of the presidential administration and YR official Vladislav Surkov outlined the ideology of Sovereign Democracy in February 2006. This is a nationalist, statist and collectivist ideology, that presupposes the domination of the political system by the Putin leadership and YR for the next 15 years. The ideology reflects some aspects of the Soviet past, and collectivist traditions of the pre-Soviet era. This concept was expanded by YR presidium member Andrey Isayev in June 2006. He says YRs aim is to restore Russian superpower status. He summarises YR ideology as: statism, the supremacy of ideas over material advantage, the consolidation of the nation around a leader, requirement for a broad social consensus, a striving for justice and freedom. This ideology may be seen as the tacit official ideology of the Russian leadership. It is likely to remain the de facto ideology after Vladimir Putin passes from the political scene. The debate revealed consensus on one significant aspect: a belief that there could only be one correct national ideology; as a result opposition parties are delegitimised.

AB  - The majority of comparisons between state transportation systems do not control for characteristics that may vary greatly between states (e.g., vehicle miles traveled). A shortcoming of such analyses is that a state's individual characteristics can be highly influential in determining how transportation policy is set and funds are spent. The purpose of this paper is to extend previous efforts to create groups of similar peer states by developing a new methodological framework that incorporates demographic, temporal, and locational variability into the peer group delineations. We collected historical data for 42 variables on transportation infrastructure, population, economy, growth, topography and weather. To examine trends before and after the passage of ISTEA we gathered data over two time periods: 1985 through 1990 and 1995 through 2000. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we reduced variables into seven components, and then statistically clustered states into peer groups for each time period based on the components and the remaining variables. We identified a range of cluster solutions and demonstrate how cluster statistics help to describe the contextual basis behind the peer grouping. The results of this study are to provide government agencies, researchers and the public with a systematic methodological framework for identifying peer states that reflect similar attributes contributing to the development and maintenance of state transportation systems.

AB  - The definition of episodic memory includes the concept of mental time travel: the ability to re-experience a previously experienced trajectory through continuous dimensions of space and time, and to recall specific events or stimuli along this trajectory. Lesions of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex impair human episodic memory function and impair rat performance in tasks that could be solved by retrieval of trajectories. Recent physiological data suggests a novel model for encoding and retrieval of trajectories, and for associating specific stimuli with specific positions along the trajectory. During encoding in the model, external input drives the activity of head direction cells. Entorhinal grid cells integrate the head direction input to update an internal representation of location, and drive hippocampal place cells. Trajectories are encoded by Hebbian modification of excitatory synaptic connections between hippocampal place cells and head direction cells driven by external action. Associations are also formed between hippocampal cells and sensory stimuli. During retrieval, a sensory input cue activates hippocampal cells that drive head direction activity via previously modified synapses. Persistent spiking of head direction cells maintains the direction and speed of the action, updating the activity of entorhinal grid cells that thereby further update place cell activity. Additional cells, termed arc length cells, provide coding of trajectory segments based on the one-dimensional arc length from the context of prior actions or states, overcoming ambiguity where the overlap of trajectory segments causes multiple head directions to be associated with one place. These mechanisms allow retrieval of complex, self-crossing trajectories as continuous curves through space and time. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Humans have the ability to mentally recreate past events (using episodic memory) and imagine future events (by planning). The best evidence for such mental time travel is personal and thus subjective. For this reason, it is particularly difficult to study such behavior in animals. There is some indirect evidence, however, that animals have both episodic memory and the ability to plan for the future. When unexpectedly asked to do so, animals can report about their recent past experiences (episodic memory) and they also appear to be able to use the anticipation of a future event as the basis for a present action (planning). Thus, the ability to imagine past and future events may not be uniquely human. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a novel paradigm for conflict resolution in multivehicle traffic systems, where a number of mobile agents move freely in a finite area, with each agent following a prespecified-motion profile. The key idea behind the proposed method is the tessellation of the underlying motion area in a number of cells and the treatment of these cells as resources that must be acquired by the mobile agents for the execution of their motion profiles, according to an appropriate resource allocation protocol. We capitalize upon the existing literature on the real-time management of sequential resource allocation systems (RASs) and develop such protocols that can formally guarantee the safe and live operation of the underlying traffic system, while they remain scalable with respect to the number of the moving agents. Collective past experience with the considered policies indicates that they also provide a pretty large coverage of the RAS behavioral space that characterizes its safe and live operation. Finally, we also establish that the aforementioned approach is applicable even in traffic systems where all vehicles must be in perpetual motion until their retirement.

AB  - Tissue factor (TF), the principal procoagulant of human brain, resides in specific regions of the non-human primate central nervous system. Immunohistochemical studies employing murine anti-human TF monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) detected TF antigen in the cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord in three normal baboon subjects. Although significantly less prominent than human cortical gray matter, a distinct partition of TF in gray matter > white matter was noted. The gray matter predilection of TF was confirmed in primate temporal and parietal lobe cortex by both sandwich ELISA and one-stage coagulation assay. Variation in the relative quantity of TF antigen was observed by ELISA among the three subjects studied. Procoagulant activity followed the pattern of TF antigen (cortical gray matter > basal ganglia > or = cerebellum > cortical white matter), and was 96.5-98.5% inhibitable by a function inhibiting anti-human TF MoAb combination. TF antigen was associated with the microvasculature of all cerebral tissues studied, and spared capillaries most selectively in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These findings suggest a highly specific ordering of TF antigen and related procoagulant activity in the central nervous system of the baboon, confined primarily to gray matter parenchyma, and to the non-capillary microvasculature.

AB  - A wide range of energy forms are being consumed, including natural gas (NG) for industrial uses and heating, electricity for light and to power electronic devices, petrochemicals to produce plastics, and petroleum derivatives such as gasoline and diesel for transportation. Because modern life is based on energy, individuals, corporations, and firms should have a reliable access to energy in all its forms. Problems involving the continuous transportation and delivery of energy can lead to the disruption and breakdown of economic, industrial, and social infrastructures. An energy resource cannot be reliable unless, first, it is delivered to right place at the right time, and secondly, it must be available in the consumer-desired quantity. Maintaining the efficient and reliable generation, transportation, and distribution of energy is the most important in a world, which is so dependent on energy. Different kinds of energy are used in today's industries and in people's lives. Some are fossil fuel resources such as oil and gas, but electricity, nuclear energy, solar energy resources, wind energy, and wave energy are also being used. All of these types should be delivered to consumers. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many situations it can be enormously helpful to archive the raw contents of a network traffic stream to disk, to enable later inspection of activity that becomes interesting only in retrospect. We present a Time Machine (TM) for network traffic that provides such a capability. The TM leverages the heavy-tailed nature of network flows to capture nearly all of the likely-interesting traffic while storing only a small fraction of the total volume. An initial proof-of-principle prototype established the forensic value of such an approach, contributing to the investigation of numerous attacks at a site with thousands of users. Based on these experiences, a rearchitected implementation of the system provides flexible, high- performance traffic stream capture, indexing and retrieval, includ- ing an interface between the TM and a real-time network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The NIDS controls the TM by dynami- cally adjusting recording parameters, instructing it to permanently store suspicious activity for offline forensics, and fetching traffic from the past for retrospective analysis. We present a detailed per- formance evaluation of both stand-alone and joint setups, and re- port on experiences with running the system live in high-volume environments.

AB  - This article traces the development of time travel in Japanesemanga, comparing it with the same theme in Western films. Time travel films of the 1960s in the US tend to have the character of a search and rescue/repairmission, evidence perhaps of a fascination with the idea that the passage of time can be ‘controlled’ (or ‘conquered’) by the ever-advancing technologies of man. In the world of Japanese manga, Tezuka Osamu exercised a comparable control of time in his decade-long serial Phoenix. Since the 1980s time travellers have had to contend with a loss of control of time (JIN, Zipang): they get warped back into a historical time period inadvertently and have to cope with the apparent opportunity for detachment of the present from the past. Contemporary time travel manga (Haruka na machi e, Thermae Romae, Kimi to boku no ashiato)have become radically reflective: the trips are no longer to explore distant worlds, but instead thoroughly investigate the psyche of the protagonists and their fractured biographies.

AB  - Non-human primates (NHPs) are used to model human disease owing to their remarkably similar genomes, physiology, and immune systems. Recently, there has been an increased interest in modeling tuberculosis (TB) in NHPs. Macaques are susceptible to infection with different strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), producing the full spectrum of disease conditions, including latent infection, chronic progressive infection, and acute TB, depending on the route and dose of infection. Clearly, NHPs are an excellent model of human TB. While the initial aim of the NHP model was to allow preclinical testing of candidate vaccines and drugs, it is now also being used to study pathogenesis and immune correlates of protection. Recent advances in this field are discussed in this review. Key questions such as the effect of hypoxia on the biology of Mtb and the basis of reactivation of latent TB can now be investigated through the use of this model.

Human impacts are also being examined through mapping of settlements and community interviews. Preliminary results confirm that areas of high carnivore activity correlate positively with protected areas and water availability, and negatively with human presence. Analysis of GPS data (Nov 2004-Oct 2005) from the collared lions has indicated a clear preference for grassland however, male prefers woodland and shrubby savannah more than the female. Additionally, enormous difference in space usage was observed between male and female lion, which is likely to bring males closer to humans and exacerbate conflicts. Male lion was closest to the human settlements in the dry season (April-September) during dawn and dusk.

In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

Such commitments are powerfully motivating, and are frequently expressed in \nnon-utilitarian or costly behavior. Yet unlike psychological impairment, religious \ncognition rarely produces lasting maladaptive outcomes. Indeed, on many indices of \nhealth and prosperity, religious persons flourish.   This paper combines commitment-\nsignaling theory with insights from the literature on decoupled representation to \nspecify features of an evolvable cognitive design for this peculiar mode of human \nunderstanding.  I review evidence for this design, urging that the psychological \narchitecture responsible for religious cognition is best viewed as self-deceptive mental \ntime-travel. Because this architecture is highly constrained by functional problems, we \ncan use evolutionary task analysis to empirically explore specific design features.

AB  - This study focuses on grasping the spatial changes that have taken place in a provincial city and aims to clarify the decision making processes of administrators and public transportation companies in Nagano City from a spatial point of view. Geographic studies of public transportation can be divided into two categories: those that put the emphasis on the spatial analysis of the network, and those that are descriptive accounts of the development of transportation in a community. This study attempts to clarify the spatiotemporal nodal structure, taking into account both the spatial profile and transitions over time. Metrical analysis and historical description, two previously separate methodologies, were combined to achieve this objective. Specifically, we first performed an analysis of the spatial structure of the public transportation network as it has gone through yearly changes. Then we examined how the decision making of the administrative and contracting arms has progressed in response to these changes. Finally, we looked into the influence such decisions have had on changes in public transportation. Factor analysis, based on the number of bus and railway runs flow, was used to clarify the changes in nodal structures. These results were then used to compare the convenience of public transportation in various districts in the city with consideration of the population distribution. As a result, with the exception of the central area of Nagano City where buses and railways are concentrated, the nodal structure on the whole experienced a simplification in the decade from 1990 to 2000 due to the decrease in inter-district connections. The disparity in the convenience of public transportation between the central and surrounding districts has also grown due to the deteriorating connections in surrounding districts. However, this gap was also likely subject to the influence of the Nagano Olympics and the extension of the Nagano Shinkansen in the central part of the city. Although the administration has been trying to reduce the number of areas with poor public transit access to minimize the disparity, which has increased due to the change in network spatial patterns, to date it has continued to give priority to ensuring access for citizens traveling in the central urban areas. Currently, given the fact that the number of passengers is not expected to increase, railway companies are focusing on increasing the carrying capacity and linking the rail transportation with other types of transportation in some of the busier zones. Also, bus companies are reducing and eliminating/merging some routes, while trying to maintain the existing service lines, which are still in high demand. The administration is encouraging policies to reduce poor-access areas, whereas the transportation companies are trying to improve the efficiency of the existing network, and although both are working toward improvement, differences of opinion are bound to occur because of the different strategies. In conclusion, to understand the spatial pattern change in public transportation, it is necessary not only to follow the tendencies over time but also to have a clear view of the decisions made and especially policies formed by the administration and the companies.

AB  - The continuous dynamic network loading problem (CDNLP) aims to compute link travel times and path travel times on a congested network, given time-dependent path flow rates for a given time period. A crucial element of CDNLP is a model of the link performance. Two main modeling frameworks have been used in link loading models: The so-called whole-link travel time (WTT) models and the kinematic wave model of Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) for traffic flow. In this paper, we reformulate a well-known whole-link model in which the link travel time, for traffic entering a time t, is a function of the number of vehicles on link. This formulation does not require the satisfying of the FIFO (first in, first out) condition. An extension of the basic WTT model is proposed in order to take explicitly into account the maximum number of vehicles that the link can accommodate (occupancy constraint). A solution scheme for the proposed WTT model is derived. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate that the FIFO condition is not respected for the WTT model and to compare the travel time predictions effected by LWR and WTT models. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain and infertility in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the normal location, predominantly in the pelvic peritoneum causing severe abdominal pain. However, the severity of the symptoms of endometriosis does not always correlate with the anatomic severity of the disease. This lack of correlation may be due to morphological lesion variation during disease progression. This study examined lesion kinetics in a non-human primate model of endometriosis to better understand lesion dynamics.\n\nMETHODS: Endometriosis was experimentally induced in nine normal cycling female adult olive baboons (Papio anubis) by i.p. inoculation of autologous menstrual endometrium on Day 2 of menses for two consecutive menstrual cycles. Diagnostic laparoscopies were performed between Day 8-12 post-ovulation at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, followed by a necropsy at 15 months, after the second inoculation. In two animals, lesions were excised/ablated at 6 months and they were monitored for lesion recurrence and morphological changes by serial laparoscopy. Furthermore, five control animals underwent surgeries conducted at the same time points but without inoculation.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 542 endometriotic lesions were observed. The location, macroscopic (different colours) and microscopic appearance confirmed distinct endometriosis pathology in line with human disease. The majority of the lesions found 1 month after tissue inoculation were red lesions, which frequently changed colour during the disease progression. In contrast, blue lesions remained consistently blue while white lesions were evident at the later stages of the disease process and often regressed. There were significantly lower numbers of powder burn, blister and multicoloured lesions observed per animal in comparison to black and blue lesions (P-value≤0.05). New lesions were continually arising and persisted up to 15 months post-inoculation. Lesions reoccurred as early as 3 months after removal and 69% of lesions excised/ablated had reoccurred 9 months later. Interestingly, endometriotic lesions were also found in the non-inoculated animals, starting at the 6-month time point following multiple surgeries.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Documentation of lesion turnover in baboons indicated that lesions changed their colour from red to white over time. Different lesion types underwent metamorphosis at different rates. A classification of lesions based on morphological appearance may help disease prognosis and examination of the effect of the lesion on disease symptoms, and provide new opportunities for targeted therapies in order to prevent or treat endometriosis. Surgical removal of endometriotic lesions resulted in a high incidence of recurrence. Spontaneous endometriosis developed in control baboons in the absence of inoculation suggesting that repetitive surgical procedures alone can induce the spontaneous evolution of the chronic disease. Although lesion excision/ablation may have short-term benefits (e.g. prior to an IVF cycle in subfertile women), for long-term relief of symptoms perhaps medical therapy is more effective than surgical therapy.

AB  - The rapid growth of international container handling in recent years has led to an increased utilization of mega-containerships and the rebuild of container network. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - We performed a prospective study of the effects of radial keratotomy in the owl monkey. We compared a 16-incision and an eight-incision radial keratotomy, and followed the changes in corneal curvature, corneal thickness, endothelial cell counts, and intraocular pressure. We compared the results of the changes in these clinical factors with a histopathologic and ultrastructural analysis of the time-related changes after radial keratotomy in another group of animals. We found that the loss of initial corneal flattening following radial keratotomy corresponded with the contracture of the wound as demonstrated by histopathologic and ultrastructural study. This procedure results in a significant endothelial cell loss (14% to 15%), which is a result of the postsurgical inflammation associated with this surgery. Additionally, examination of the histopathologic structure of these corneas showed a high level of variability in the surgical incision depth, which we believe is responsible for the marked variations in the response to the surgical procedure.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - Let G = (V, E) be a graph and r: V → Z+. An r-detachment of G is a graph H obtained by 'splitting' each vertex v ε V into r(v) vertices, called the pieces of v in H. Every edge uv ε E corresponds to an edge of H connecting some piece of u to some piece of v. An r-degree specification for G is a function f on V, such that, for each vertex v ε V, f (v) is a partition of d(v) into r(v) positive integers. An f-detachment of G is an r-detachment H in which the degrees in H of the pieces of each v ε V are given by f (v). Crispin Nash-Williams [3] obtained necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph to have a k-edge-connected r-detachment or f-detachment. We solve a problem posed by Nash-Williams in [2] by obtaining analogous results for non-separable detachments of graphs. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - In the summer of 2003, the Executive Director of the Vietnam Education Foundation, an independent agency established by the United States Congress in 2000, asked me to conduct a preliminary report of Vietnamese academic libraries. The goal was to assess the present status of Vietnamese academic libraries in Vietnam's higher education as well as national development, especially in the areas of scientific development. This study is the result of my visits to major Vietnamese academic and public libraries, a survey of several academic libraries, and discussions I had with Vietnamese library leadership, either in person or through e-mail exchanges in July and August 2003. Needless to say, this study is far from comprehensive. Nonetheless, it identifies the salient challenges facing Vietnamese academic libraries. It also contends that Vietnam will not succeed in its modernization effort, especially in developing a knowledge-based economy, unless Vietnam is ready to devote not only a vast amount of resource to modernize its academic libraries but also to radically transform its outdated its higher education's curricular, for they are intricately linked. While this study focuses on Vietnamese academic libraries, it also brings to light to a great extend the major common challenges (lack of well-trained library professionals, modern library facilities, shortage of up-to-date scientific resources, government owned and operated universities and publishing houses, censorship, outdated instructional methods, etc.) facing academic libraries in many developing countries, especially transforming socialist states. Thus this study, albeit preliminary, should be of interest to many of these countries as well.

Indicators are used to measure the progress of related tasks toward RWES goals. These indicators are classified by the Driving Force-State-Response (DSR) framework to facilitate the analysis of relationships among indicators. Linkages between budget allocation and indicators are also analyzed, and the result is used to assess whether the available budget is allocated properly to raise the RWES.

AB  - The social learning strategies tournament was an open computer-based tournament investigating the best way to learn in a changing environment. Here we present an analysis of the impact of memory on the ability of strategies entered into the social learning strategies tournament (Rendell, Boyd, et al., 2010) to modify their own behavior to suit a changing environment. The tournament showed that a strategy's ability to remember the past and to predict the future were both key to its success. The possibility that a strategy needs to engage in an approximation of 'mental time travel' to succeed in the tournament strongly implies that investment in randomly timed social learning is not enough to guarantee success. A strategy must use social learning strategically with reference to both predicted future environmental states and past environmental states. We examine the two most successful strategies (DiscountMachine and Intergeneration) in terms of their use of memory and discuss the impact of their complex memory use on their ability to time learning moves strategically and track environmental change. The tournament suggests that the human capacity for mental time travel may have improved the efficiency of social learning and allowed humans to invest in more sophisticated social learning than is seen elsewhere in the animal kingdom. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although many of the problems that Cali is experiencing - social and human capital deterioration, a declining economy, and institutional crisis - are a reflection of Colombia s complicated socioeconomic situation, the city has been hit harder by the crisis than other large cities, as confirmed by the following indicators: GDP, unemployment, poverty rate, inequality, and number of homicides. According to recent estimates, the population in Cali reached the 2 million level in 1999, making the city the second largest in the country after Bogota. Internal migration increased significantly during the early 90s due to the economic boom generated by drug dealing activities, and continued in the last part of the decade, due to resettlement movements of large population groups, affected by social conflict in rural areas. However, migration flows have generated social tension in the city, as economic opportunities became scarce. The Bank engaged in a participatory process to produce a City Development Strategy (CDS), whose specific objectives are to help the city administration and stakeholders identify a strategy to overcome the current crisis, and, be a neutral facilitator in the reconstruction process. The CDS is being developed in four stages: 1) identification of the main problems; 2) development of the analytical framework; 3) dissemination of results; and, 4) development of a financial plan.

AB  - The delineation of early infarction in large gyrencephalic brain cannot be accomplished with triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) due to its limitations in the early phase, nor can it be identified with microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) immunohistochemistry, due to the fragility of large thin sections. We hypothesize that MAP2 immunostaining of thick brain sections can accurately identify early ischemia in the entire monkey brain. Using ischemic brains of one rat and three monkeys, a thick-section MAP2 immunostaining protocol was developed to outline the infarct region over the entire non-human primate brain. Comparison of adjacent thick and thin sections in a rat brain indicated complete correspondence between ischemic regions (100.4 mm3 ?? 1.2%, n = 7, p = 0.44). Thick sections in monkey brain possessed the increased structural stability necessary for the extensive MAP2 immunostaining procedure permitting quantification of the ischemic region as a percent of total monkey brain, giving infarct volumes of 11.4, 16.3, and 19.0% of total brain. Stacked 2D images of the intact thick brain tissue sections provided a 3D representation for comparison to MRI images. The infarct volume of 16.1 cm3 from the MAP2 sections registered with MRI images agreed well with the volume calculated directly from the stained sections of 16.6 cm3. Thick brain tissue section MAP2 immunostaining provides a new method for determining infarct volume over the entire brain at early time points in a non-human primate model of ischemic stroke. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation experiments are performed using a variation of the model first suggested by Cameron (1992a) with a focus on identifying likely lower bounds on these gains. In addition to examining single-bounded contingent valuation as a component of the combined model, this paper investigates additional gains that may accrue from employing a double-bounded variant of contingent valuation. Sizable gains in both bias and precision are found in the simulation experiments. The results suggest that additional investigation into these models is warranted.

AB  - The transportation of freight embodies exchanges and commerce in human society and, thus, constitutes a major enabling factor for most of our economic and social activities. The importance of this role is continuously increasing, as do the requirements for freight transportation, to be efficient, reliable, flexible, and responsive to our continuously evolving and, sometimes, contradictory needs and expectations. These requirements challenge operations research and transportation science to continuously enhance our methodological capabilities and innovatively apply them to important issues in the analysis, planning, and management of freight transportation and logistics.

AB  - This paper examines whether travel cost models value transportation properly. It uses contingent behavior and contingent pricing analyses to explore the valuation of transport costs within the context of recreation demand. The contingent behavior analysis poses hypothetical increases in travel costs-travel distance and access fees-and examines the demand responses. In contrast, the 'contingent pricing' analysis asks respondents to state the increase in travel costs that is consistent with certain reductions in recreation demand, in this case, reductions that eliminate demand. By comparing distance-related responses to fee-related responses, the two analyses estimate factors for testing and improving the valuation of transport costs. To achieve these ends, the two analyses also explore the valuation of time costs. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In many applications some designs are easier to implement, require less training data and shorter training time, and consume less storage than others. Such designs are called simple designs and are usually preferred over complex ones when they all have good performance. Despite the abundant existing studies on how to find good designs in simulation-based optimization, there exist few studies on finding simplest good designs. This article considers this important problem and the following contributions are made to the subject. First, lower bounds are provided for the probabilities of correctly selecting the m simplest designs with top performance and selecting the best m such simplest good designs, respectively. Second, two efficient computing budget allocation methods are developed to find m simplest good designs and to find the best m such designs, respectively, and their asymptotic optimalities have been shown. Third, the performance of the two methods is compared with equal allocations over six academic examples and a smoke detection problem in a wireless sensor network.

AB  - ARES Corporation was asked to help analyze the reliability of a subsystem composed only of demand type components ("one-shot" pyrotechnic devices) for a missile defense vehicle. The subsystem was composed of twenty component types and some seventy component instances arranged in various series parallel blocks. Each component was considered to be only as reliable as indicated by a relatively small set of tests in a relevant environment. ARES formulated a conjugate-pair Bayesian analysis approach, in which each component was associated with a uniform prior distribution on (0,1) - representing no information about reliability-combined with a binomial likelihood function on n tests and f failures. The result is a Beta posterior distribution on component reliability, which can be calculated easily in a spreadsheet. A Monte Carlo analysis on the system logic then derives the probability distribution at the system level. The client required that the testing budget be allocated to maximize the payoff in expected system reliability. The solution was an optimization algorithm which identifies, after each additional test has been added, that component which will yield the largest reliability gain per dollar at the system level given a single additional successful test. The model thus considers both the component reliability and the cost of an additional test on that component when designing a test plan. The current model evaluates the optimum allocation of tests among the various components to prove that the system has a specified reliability at a given confidence level, assuming that no failures occur in the additional tests. This methodology can be extended to account for a non-zero number of failures in additional tests, though at considerable expense in computation time

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - The porous and contestable features of African boundaries are two interacting themes that are closely linked to the emergence and spread of conflict in Africa in the last decade. This study uses the Mano River Region-Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Ivory Coast-to illustrate how border issues contribute to the perpetuation of insecurity. Border evolution is traced from precolonial to colonial to the postindependence period to include the details of how the countries of the Mano River Region attained their current dimensions. The focus then shifts to the current decade, when violence in one country stimulated a similar phenomenon in a neighboring state until the entire region was enveloped. Several facets of porous borders facilitated this pattern to include the flow of weapons, the movement of former combatants, and the transnational exploitation of resources. Contestable borders have not been as much of a factor in stimulating conflict, but, given the current political and economic malaise in Africa, the potential certainly exists for more challenges to extant boundaries. If porous borders come under tighter national control, a goal in many African countries, then it is likely that more boundary locations will be contested.

AB  - The resource-allocation principle, which combines policy and budget, is the basic criterion for public-policy planning of a government in the present era. It can make the policy target, construction project, and budget work together closely. The transportation construction project has a certain degree of relativity under a target; so when selecting projects, a division of levels should be carried out according to the priority of project desirability 19 Furthermore, the relativity of potential cooperation-competition between projects must be identified to avoid any waste of limited resources. This is the focus point that will be discussed in this paper. Lastly, this research classified the cooperation-competition relation of a construction project into independent project, complementary project, overlapping project, and common complementary overlapping project. This research made a subjective judgment based on relevant domain experts' professional accomplishments, and then identified the experts' consensus.

AB  - This paper assesses the heterogeneous effects of population aging on personal budget allocation across sectors. Using China's household survey data, we break down each household expenditure component into its constituent members. We find consistent and robust age profiles of the composition of personal consumption expenditures. Young people spend larger proportions of their budget on food and education, culture, and recreation services. The middle-aged spend significantly more on clothing and transportation and communication. Lastly, the elderly spend substantially more on food and health care and medical services. After controlling for period and cohort effects as well as other socio-economic factors, we still find age to be a fundamental driver of consumption budget allocation. We also incorporate the estimated results into the population forecast data and predict the evolution of China's consumption budget allocation patterns driven by demographic change. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Numerous interventions have been developed and shown effective in rodent models; however, none of these has been proven effective in human besides rtPA. The rodent stroke model simply does not adequately reflect the complexity and dynamics of human stroke. It is the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) recommendation that NHP stroke models need to be established for assessing novel interventions before clinical trials. Non-human primate (NHP) stroke model and non-invasive imaging technologies, such as MRI, are of significant importance albeit challenging. This study described the development of a baboon stroke model and the spatiotemporal evolution of the ischemic lesion by perfusion and diffusion MRI on a clinical scanner. Methods: Three normal female baboons (15-20kg) were subjected to permanent (n=1) or 90-min (n=2) MCAO using an endovascular approach (balloon occlusion at M1). Animals were anesthetized with ~2% isoflurane during stroke surgery and 0.8~1.0% isoflurane with vecuronium (0.1mg/kg) during MRI. Multimodal MRI including anatomical, perfusion (arterial spin labeling), diffusion, and MRA were performed on a clinical Siemens 3T scanner. Images were acquired every 30 min from 1 hour postreperfusion up to 6 hours (permanent) or 4 hours (transient). Data were processed using custom-codes written in Matlab. Quantitative cerebral blood flow (mL/100g/min) and apparent diffusion coefficient (mm2/s) maps were calculated. Lesion volume was derived with thresholding (CBF>70mL/100g/min and ADC<0.53x10-3 mm2/s). Final infarct was determined with T2 images. Results: Perfusion-diffusion mismatch was robustly detected in the one animal underwent permanent stroke. In the transient ischemia group, hyperperfusion were detected repeatedly. The percent ipsi-lesional to contra-lesional CBF and ADC were ~149.6% and ~72.5% respectively at one-hour post-reperfusion. The percent ipsi- to contra-lesional ADC ratios degraded ~63.8%) overtime indicating the tissue progress to infarct. The percent ipsi- to contra-lesional CBF ratios remain relatively constant (~136.8%) up to four hours after reperfusion, and the defined lesion volume approximates the final infarct. Conclusions: This study described for the first time of monitoring both the spatial and temporal evolution of perfusion and diffusion characteristics on NHP stroke model using a clinical MRI scanner. Repeated perfusion measurements on large NHP were not feasible previously with DSC-MRI. The perfusion-diffusion mismatch approximates the penumbra was shown. An interesting hyperperfusion was observed within the diffusion lesion in transient stroke. Future studies will utilizes this multimodal MRI protocol to evaluate the spatiotemporal changes of baboon stroke, which provides a potential platform for developing novel interventions.

Results, based on a large national sample, revealed that over a 28-year period, GMA affected growth in 2 indicators of extrinsic career success (income and occupational prestige), such that the careers of high-GMA individuals ascended more steeply over time than those of low-GMA individuals. Part of the reason high-GMA individuals had steeper growth in extrinsic success over time was because they attained more education, completed more job training, and gravitated toward more complex jobs. GMA also moderated the degree to which within-individual variation in the mediating variables affected within-individual variation in extrinsic career success over time: Education, training, and job complexity were much more likely to translate into career success for more intelligent individuals.

Combined, state public pension plans are just 39 percent funded. Figures were drawn from state Fiscal Year 2012 Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, as well as the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports and actuarial valuations published by individual plans. In each case, figures were from the most up-to-date valuation available at the time of research. Plans were compiled based on the United States Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Public Pensions and state-level financial reports. Therefore this includes municipal pension funds that are administered by the state. States facing a particularly large unfunded liability at a per capita level and as a percentage of their annual gross state product include Illinois, Ohio, New Jersey, Oregon, Connecticut, Nevada, New Mexico, Hawaii, and Alaska. As this report demonstrates, unfunded public pension liabilities present a unique threat to state government finances. While many have tried to turn a blind eye to the pension crisis, the problem is simply too big to ignore.

AB  - An innovative modular aircraft, called Clip-Air, is being designed at Ecole Poly-technique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). The novelty of Clip-Air from a transportation system viewpoint is its flexibility due to the decoupling of load and carrying units. In this paper, we analyze the impacts of the flexibility of Clip-Air from the airlines perspective. To quantify the potential advantages of this new system, an integrated schedule design and fleet assignment model is developed for both standard airline fleets and Clip-Air. The model considers spill and recapture effects to represent the demand in case of capacity shortage. Recapture ratios between available itineraries in each market segment are appropriately calculated through an itinerary choice model. The comparative analysis is carried out under different scenarios which are selected with the purpose of understanding the effects of the network structure, fleet size, fleet configuration and the estimated cost figures for the Clip-Air system. It is observed that Clip-Air uses the transportation capacity more efficiently by carrying more passengers with less overall capacity. Moreover, Clip-Air is found to deal better with insufficient transportation capacity. Furthermore, the scheduling decisions are robust to the estimated cost figures of Clip-Air. For the analyzed range of costs Clip-Air is always carrying more passengers with less allocated capacity compared to standard fleet.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to disseminate information regarding the international research project titled 'Information System Dynamics' (ISD) initiated by Club Informatique des Grandes Entreprises Francaises (IS) (CIGREF), France, an association of French and other European companies representing the users of information systems (IS) (CIGREF 2008a). This information is targeted at a wider community of researchers and practitioners globally, particularly in India, and is aimed at bringing in greater awareness of the key perspectives of this international research project among a variety of stakeholders. These include the communities of large companies (users of information system (IS)/information technologies (IT), vendors, governments, academia, industry, and research institutions, among others. ISD would mobilize the collective intelligence of these communities and prepare them to plan for and create their own future. ISD has been designed as a multidisciplinary project, focusing on long-term impacts of IS/IT on multiple dimensions such as business models, innovations, human resource, best practices, and regulations.

AB  - Most organizations are complex environments, where multiple projects interact with each other in many different ways. Projects can collaborate either serially or in parallel, yet at other times they compete with each other to test different approaches for the same goal. In such organizations, it is not uncommon for the wrong project to be funded or a right project to be under funded apparently for all the right reasons. In turn these project failures can cause big problems to their dependent projects, even having catastrophic impacts to the whole organization. Given a limited budget, it is critical to the organization's success to strategically optimize the set of projects that are initiated, and for these projects to be able to depend on their selected project dependencies or collaborators. Conceptually this is obvious, but in practice to identify the right set of projects and to allocate the right amount of budget is very challenging. We propose an approach to tackle the problem from a risk management perspective: first model each project as a chain of executable tasks and model the organization as a network of tasks; then optimize the budget allocation from the system's perspective.

AB  - The chapter focuses on the public feelings over WikiLeaks, and demonstrates how affect and emotion, in conjunction with digital culture and the social media, enabled shifts in the political. I am using the WikiLeaks controversy, and the storm of public feelings it generated, in order to demonstrate how affective flows can snowball into a revolutionary shift in reality. The order of theoretical sampling and analysis begins with a philosophical discussion of the role of affective structures in mediating the actual and the digital virtual. It then moves on to the interface between ideology and organization in WikiLeaks, as an example of ideological tensions producing affect in relation to that organization. Further, I discuss the interface between hierarchy and networks, such as activist networks against states and global institutions, in order to examine the interfaces between emotion and affect, as the expressive (Shaviro 2010:2) causes and the driving engine behind revolts and uprisings.

AB  - This work builds further on the Orbital Transportation Network Analysis methodology proposed by the authors in earlier research. Through a review of the literature of flexibility, the different types of flexibility that can apply to an orbital transportation network, and their relationships to the system architecture, are explored. Finally a provider- side flexibility metric is defined as a combination of the different types of flexibilities. The resulting metric can then be used in addition to performance and value metrics to rank the best architectures for the orbital transportation network. It is argued that service flexibility for an orbital transportation network can be defined as the combination of three types of flexibilities, which play out in different time frames: Mix flexibility (long-term), Volume flexibility (mid-term), and emergency service flexibility (short term). Using these definitions, different architectures for an orbital transportation network were evaluated on the basis of their flexibility, value, and performance metrics.

AB  - Implementation of NextGen operational concepts and procedures within the air trans- portation system will require the definition of appropriate measures of performance, as well as a deep understanding of the systems limitations and margins for improvement. In this paper, we derive an analogy between the operation of the air transportation system and that of a supply chain by leveraging the similarities between the air transportation system and the beer distribution system, and conducting a thorough examination and comparison of the measures of performance and constraints in both systems. Based on the proposed analogy, as well as previous research conducted in the field of supply chain modeling, we de- fine an equivalent supply chain framework and define appropriate measures of performance for the air transportation system. Finally, we model a network of airports and ARTCCs to help illustrate the implementation of particular supply chain management methods and lean manufacturing strategies, and help identify margins for improvement in the operation of the air transportation system. This model is further used to study the consequences of the implementation of 4-D trajectory-based operations.

AB  - People regularly travel through time mentally to remember and reconstruct past events and to anticipate and plan future events. We suggest that a bi-cone structure best describes human mental time travel (MTT) abilities. Experiments with scrub-jays, rats and non-human primates have investigated whether MTT is uniquely human by examining the abilities of these animals to remember what, where and when an event occurred and to anticipate future events. We argue that animal memory for when an event happened must be distinguished from memory for how long ago it happened to properly evaluate parallels with human capabilities. Similarly, tests of future MTT in animals must show that they are planning for a specific time in the future to demonstrate qualitative comparability with human MTT.

AB  - Since World War II, cities and suburbs grew, more roads were built, and more people had to rely on cars and buses for work, shopping, and business. In fact, in the last 30 years, the total number of vehicle miles driven grew 4 times faster than the rate of population growth, increasing to 2.6 trillion miles per year. The fuel these cars, buses, and other vehicles burn emits substances into the air that harm human health and the environment. Despite regulations limiting these emissions and improved vehicle and fuel technologies, the air in numerous cities and towns still does not meet air quality standards. Therefore, communities may look to change their future transportation and land use plans as a means to curb emissions. Recognizing that transportation can affect the nation's efforts to improve air quality, the Congress has provided funds for projects that protect air quality. Now, as the Congress begins the work of reauthorizing the surface transportation programs,- it will have to consider whether to continue or revise these initiatives. To help inform this work, we are commenting on (1) the impacts of surface transportation on air quality; (2) the benefits and limits of key federal surface transportation and clean air requirements and programs designed to mitigate these impacts; and (3) ways the federal government can use these requirements and programs to further reduce these impacts. Our findings and recommendations are based to a large extent on the results of a survey we conducted in 2001 of all of the 341 metropolitan planning organizations in existence at that time (295, or 87 percent, responded). These organizations are responsible for developing transportation plans and ensuring that they do not worsen air quality.

AB  - Neuroscience is progressively increasing its comprehension of the normal functioning of the central and peripheral nervous system. Such understanding is essential to challenge important neurodegenerative dis- orders and clinical conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, etc. The aim of neuroscience research is to improve understanding of normal and pathological functions and to develop therapeutic strategies and tools. Fundamental neuroscience utilizes a variety of techniques which include: electrophysiology, imaging, and computational modelling and entails interactions with clinical studies. Non-human primates are the closest species to humans in terms of biological, physiological, im- munological and neurological characteristics; their closeness has been, and is still, an important reason for using them in biomedical studies. These animals have a vertebrate brain that is most like that of humans in terms of neural circuitry and this, together with similarities with human physiological and behavioural characteristics, makes them more valuable and accurate models of neurological and psychiatric diseases than other animals. This article provides an overview of the contribution of non-human primate models in fundamental neuroscience research and in generating clinically relevant findings and therapeutic develop- ments.

AB  - In a dynamic world, mechanisms allowing prediction of future situations can provide a selective advantage. We suggest that memory systems differ in the degree of flexibility they offer for anticipatory behavior and put forward a corresponding taxonomy of prospection. The adaptive advantage of any memory system can only lie in what it contributes for future survival. The most flexible is episodic memory, which we suggest is part of a more general faculty of mental time travel that allows us not only to go back in time, but also to foresee, plan, and shape virtually any specific future event. We review comparative studies and find that, in spite of increased research in the area, there is as yet no convincing evidence for mental time travel in nonhuman animals. We submit that mental time travel is not an encapsulated cognitive system, but instead comprises several subsidiary mechanisms. A theater metaphor serves as an analogy for the kind of mechanisms required for effective mental time travel. We propose that future research should consider these mechanisms in addition to direct evidence of future-directed action. We maintain that the emergence of mental time travel in evolution was a crucial step towards our current success.

AB  - Resource allocation has long been a controversial issue in nonprofit organizations such as libraries, where services are the major products. Objective measures of performance are either lacking or difficult to evaluate, and the decision maker is forced to make subjective allocations based on insufficient information and are highly vulnerable to a personal bias. Consequently, an aggressive, loquacious, or powerful department head can acquire a larger portion of the resources than acquired by the heads of other departments. A case study is presented in which the Delphi technique is applied to utilize expert judgment in systematically allocating personnel and budgetary resources for a university library in Taiwan. Anonymous group decisions via the Delphi method both reduces the bias of the dean in making personnel decisions and eliminates the dominance of some powerful heads in group discussions. Results show that consensus of the panel of experts not only produced a more equitable budget allocation, but also saved 3.5 full-time equivalent employees and 520,000 New Taiwan dollars. It is concluded that the Delphi technique is an effective method for resource allocation.

In the last decade, a renewed and growing interest in non-human primate models has resulted from the use of small callitrichid species in behavioral pharmacology and neuroscience. This review focuses on the available non-human primate models for investigating fear/anxiety, addressing their advantages, shortcomings and conceptual framework on which they are based, Lastly, a new ethologically based model to study anxiety and fear-induced aviodance in callitrichids - the marmoset predator confrontation test - is discussed.

In vitro proliferative responses of splenocytes to the T cell mitogen concanavalin A and the B cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide were unaffected. Acute (<1 day) stress dramatically increased innate immunity as measured by a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay of phagocytic cell function. DBA/2J mice averaged a 269% increase in phagocytosis as compared to a 412% increase in C57BL/6J. This differential effect of stress on immune responsiveness indicates that alterations in innate immunity in addition to adaptive immunity should also be considered when evaluating neuroendocrine and immune interactions in response to stress.

AB  - This paper discusses the quantum mechanics of closed timelike curves (CTC) and of other potential methods for time travel. We analyze a specific proposal for such quantum time travel, the quantum description of CTCs based on post-selected teleportation (P-CTCs). We compare the theory of P-CTCs to previously proposed quantum theories of time travel: the theory is physically inequivalent to Deutsch's theory of CTCs, but it is consistent with path-integral approaches (which are the best suited for analyzing quantum field theory in curved spacetime). We derive the dynamical equations that a chronology-respecting system interacting with a CTC will experience. We discuss the possibility of time travel in the absence of general relativistic closed timelike curves, and investigate the implications of P-CTCs for enhancing the power of computation.

This allows more detailed planning than is afforded by the more general mechanisms of instinct, learning, and semantic memory. To be useful, episodic memory need not provide a complete or even a faithful record of past events, and may even be part of a process whereby we construct fictional accounts. The properties of language are aptly designed for the communication and sharing of episodes, and for the telling of stories; these properties include symbolic representation of the elements of real-world events, time markers, and combinatorial rules.

AB  - The pharmacokinetics of clofibric acid (CPIB, the active metabolite of clofibrate) has been studied in two species of non-human primate after administration by two routes at three dose levels. Plasma CPIB concentrations were determined by HPLC. In both the cynomolgus monkey and the baboon, the systemic availability of orally administered CPIB did not differ significantly from 100%; the rates of bioavailability, however, showed a dose-related trend. At the lowest dose level (15 mg/kg), the plasma concentration-time profile appeared to follow first order kinetics, with an apparent t1/2 of 1 h; at dose levels which might be used in toxicity studies (45 and 150 mg/kg) the apparent t1/2 was longer, indicating dose-related trends by both routes of administration. The pharmacokinetics of CPIB are therefore non-linear over the dose range considered. CPIB protein binding was concentration-dependent over the range 50-700 micrograms/ml. Re-estimation of kinetic parameters in terms of free drug concentration did not remove the non-linearity. It is concluded that the pharmacokinetics of CPIB in the non-human primate are dose-dependent but that the extent of absorption of an oral dose was independent of dose level over the range studied.

AB  - A consummatory conflict procedure that involves an abrupt reduction in magnitude of an expected reward (negative contrast) has been shown to be particularly sensitive to the effects of anxiolytic agents. As previously reported with chlordiazepoxide, another benzodiazepine (BDZ), midazolam released suppressed consummatory performance in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was not due to a general appetitie stimulatory effect of the drug. The effects of three 5-HT antagonists on negative contrast were examined to evaluate the role serotonin may play in the anxiolytic action of BDZ. Methysergide was found to be ineffective, cinanserin tended to reduce contrast at two intermediate doses, and cyproheptadine eliminated the contrast effect in a similar fashion as midazolam. The effectiveness of cyproheptadine may not be attributed to its anticholinergic or antihistaminergic actions since scopolamine and pyrilamine did not produce similar effects. The results are discussed in terms of the role serotonin may play in the anti-conflict action of BDZ, as well as possible interactional effects of GABA.

AB  - In this paper, the air freight network in China is systematically clustered with the three key indicators of point-degree centrality, middle degree centrality and close centrality of complex network theory based on field air freight transport data. The air freight network is also analyzed from the city, regional and airline. The results show that the distribution of the air freight network in China is imbalanced and has a very clear four hierarchy of hub-level city, regional-level city, middle-level city and edge-level city. The vast majority of air freight, routes, movements, navigable cities concentrated in a few urban and regional cities, and the freight transportation of other cities mainly depend on transfer from the central cities. Reasonable establishments of new routes and navigable cities are rather essential to improve the capacity of air freight hub cities.

AB  - We study how decision makers learn to improve performance across repeated budget allocation decisions. The costing system they use should be able to provide information that is of incremental value over mere outcome feedback. We report an experiment demonstrating that customer profitability analysis (CPA) using activity based costing facilitates learning of the most appropriate allocation of a marketing budget among customers. In a difficult learning environment, participants receiving CPA information made closer-to-optimal budget allocation decisions, resulting in higher cumulative profits compared to subjects receiving traditional accounting reports. In easier learning environments, CPA yielded a smaller additional benefit over a traditional costing system combined with outcome feedback.

AB  - Seeing the many examples in the literature of causality violations based on faster-than- light (FTL) signals one naturally thinks that FTL motion leads inevitably to the possibility of time travel. We show that this logical inference is invalid by demonstrating a model, based on (3+1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, in which FTL motion is permitted (in every direction without any limitation on speed) yet which does not admit time travel. Moreover, the Principle of Relativity is true in this model in the sense that all observers are equivalent. In short, FTL motion does not imply time travel after all.

AB  - This article presents a model for the allocation of an advertismg budget to geographic market segments, or territories, when the sales response to advertising m each segment is characterized by a probabihty distribution. It is shown that allocation decisions that are based on the expected sales response may be associated with a relatively large degree of risk and, therefore, non-optimal to a risk-averse manager. The model derives an "efficient frontier" in terms of the expected profit and its variance resulting from alternative budget allocations. The manager then chooses the optimal allocation based on his/her preference function.

AB  - The TRB Section on Multimodal Freight Transportation (A1B00) is pleased to publish this compilation of Freight Transportation Research Needs Statements. Seven of the standing committees within the section have worked over the past 2 years with their respective members to carefully focus their collective attention on pressing research needs. The purpose of such research statements is to bring critical issues in freight transportation to the attention of researchers in the freight area, and to serve as a seedbed for further discussion and analysis from a wider cross-section of freight practitioners. Transportation agencies at all levels of government—federal, state, and local—are increasingly concerned about the continuing growth in the volumes of freight transportation and the adequacy of both privately and publicly owned infrastructure and facilities to accommodate this freight growth now and in the future. A number of these research needs statements address concerns of public agencies in relation to their investments in freight facilities.

AB  - A capacity related reliability for transportation networks with random link capacity is introduced. It is defined as the probability that the road network can accommodate a certain level of traffic demand, and is built on the concept of network reserve capacity. Network reserve capacity is defined as the largest multiplier applied to an existing origin-destination demand matrix that can be allocated to a transportation network in a user-optimal way without violating the link capacities. Due to large variability associated with link capacities, a probabilistic approach is adopted to model the different physical and operational factors that often degrade the capacity of roadways. A Monte Carlo simulation procedure is developed to estimate the capacity related reliability measure. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

AB  - The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor ligands were studied in the rat safety signal withdrawal conflict procedure, an operant paradigm sensitive to both anxiolytic and anxiogenic compounds. In this procedure, behavioural suppression of lever pressing for food was induced by the withdrawal of a conditioned signal for safety without the usual presentation of a conditioned signal for danger. The compounds tested were selective CCK-B antagonists [CI-988 (0.01-1 mg/kg SC), L-365,260 (0.004-2 mg/kg IP) and LY 262,691 (0.001-1 mg/kg SC)], CCK-B agonists [CCK-4 (0.01-1 mg/kg SC) and BC 264 (0.004-1 mg/kg IP)] and CCK-A antagonists [devazepide (0.001-1 mg/kg SC) and lorglumide (0.01-1 mg/kg SC)]. None of these drugs induced the expected behavioural effects, i.e. an anxiolytic-like release of the behavioural suppression with CCK-B and, possibly, CCK-A antagonists and/or a further reduction of lever pressing with CCK-B agonists, indicative of an anxiogenic-like potential. In contrast, the established anxiolytic lorazepam (0.06-0.25 mg/kg IP), as well as diazepam (2 mg/kg IP) and buspirone (0.25 mg/kg SC) used as positive control drugs, released the suppression of pressing for food during the period associated with the safety signal withdrawal, whereas picrotoxin (1 mg/kg IP), used as an anxiogenic control, further reduced responding during this conflict period. The present results contrast with a series of published data suggesting the involvement of CCK processes in anxiety-related behaviour in rodent models such as the elevated plus-maze or the light:dark two compartment test, and in panic disorders in humans.

AB  - Natural-history collections in museums contain data critical to decisions in biodiversity conserva- tion. Collectively, these specimen-based data describe the distributions of known taxa in time and space. As the most comprehensive, reliable source of knowledge for most described species, these records are potentially available to answer a wide range of conservation and research questions. Nevertheless, these data have short- comings, notably geographic gaps, resulting mainly from the ad hoc nature of collecting effort. This problem has been frequently cited but rarely addressed in a systematic manner. We have developed a methodology to evaluate museum collection data, in particular the reliability of distributional data for narrow-range taxa. We included only those taxa for which there were an appropriate number of records, expert verification of identifications, and acceptable locality accuracy. First, we compared the available data for the taxon of inter- est to the background data, comprised of records for those organisms likely to be captured by the same methods or by the same collectors as the taxon of interest. The adequacyof background sampling effort was assessed through calculation of statistics describing the separation, density, and clustering of points, and through generation of a sampling density contour surface. Geographical information systems (GIS) technol- ogy was then used to model predicted distributions of species based on abiotic (e.g., climatic and geological) data. The robustness of these predicted distributions can be tested iteratively or by bootstrapping. Together, these methods provide an objective means to assess the likelihood of the distributions obtained from museum collection records representing true distributions. Potentially, they could be used to evaluate any point data to be collated in species maps, biodiversity assessment, or similar applications requiring distributional infor- mation.

AB  - The various tax exemptions provided to nonprofit hospitals have come under scrutiny by policymakers, with the central concern being whether those hospitals provide community benefits that justify forgone government tax revenues. In this paper, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) measures the provision of certain community benefits and compares nonprofit hospitals with for-profit hospitals. For-profit hospitals do not receive tax exemptions and are not required to meet community-benefit standards; the level of community benefits provided by for-profit hospitals serves, therefore, as a useful benchmark against which to compare nonprofit hospitals. The analysis also examines the provision of community benefits by nonfederal government hospitals.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - The goals of this paper are to present criteria, that allow to a priori quantify the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size and to check how these criteria correspond to analytic results available for infinite uncorrelated networks. As a case study, we consider public transportation networks (PTN) of several major cities of the world. To analyze their resilience against attacks, either the network nodes or edges are removed in specific sequences (attack scenarios). During each scenario the size S(c) of the largest remaining network component is observed as function of the removed share c of nodes or edges. To quantify the PTN stability with respect to different attack scenarios we use the area below the curve described by S(c) for c ∈ [0, 1] recently introduced (Schneider, C. M. et al. [PNAS 108 (2011) 3838]) as a numerical measure of network robustness. This measure captures the network reaction over the whole attack sequence. We present results of the analysis of PTN stability against node and link-targeted attacks.

AB  - In humans, whispering has evolved as a counteractive strategy against eavesdropping. Some evidence for whisper-like behavior exists in a few other species, but has not been reported in non-human primates. We discovered the first evidence of whisper-like behavior in a non-human primate, the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), in the course of investigating their use of human-directed mobbing calls. We exposed a family of captive cotton-top tamarins to a supervisor who previously elicited a strong mobbing response. Simultaneous audio-video recordings documented the animals' behavioral and vocal responses in the supervisor's presence and absence. Rather than exhibiting a mobbing response and producing loud human-directed mobbing calls, the tamarins exhibited other anti-predator behaviors and produced low amplitude vocalizations that initially eluded our detection. A post-hoc analysis of the data was conducted to test a new hypothesis-the tamarins were reducing the amplitude of their vocalizations in the context of exposure to a potential threat. Consistent with whisper-like behavior, the amplitude of the tamarins' vocalizations was significantly reduced only in the presence of the supervisor. Due to its subtle properties, this phenomenon may have eluded detection in this species. Increasing evidence of whisper-like behavior in non-human species suggests that such low amplitude signaling may represent a convergence in a communication strategy amongst highly social and cooperative species.

AB  - The effects of consumption and production externalities on economic performance under time non-separable preferences are examined both theoretically and numerically. We show that a consumption externality alone has long-run distortionary effects if and only if labor is supplied elastically. With fixed labor supply, it has only transitional distortionary effects. Production externalities always generate long-run distortions, irrespective of labor supply. The optimal tax structure to correct for the distortions is characterized. We compare the implications of this model with those obtained when the consumption externality is contemporaneous. While some of the long-run effects are robust, there are also important qualitative and quantitative differences, particularly along transitional paths. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In connection with the network realization problem the main questions of the algorithm are which edges to choose and what is the budget consequence of that. These problems can be solved by exact optimization methods, but in this case the number of computational steps (additions and comparisons) is an exponential function of the number of nodes. For this reason usually heuristic methods are chosen for solving these problems. Some special problems can be formulated as maximal flow problems. To get the solution we use only maximal flow and shortest route algorithms. Thus we decrease the number of computations, but the size of the network will grow. In this paper, we describe this algorithm to solve the network realization problem. Then we give a transportation network realization problem and show how to solve this problem by the some algorithms.

AB  - This paper surveys econometric studies of freight transportation demand which have been published since the mid-1970s. It describes the variables, data sources, and estimation procedures utilized by the studies. In addition, it summarizes their statistical results. The studies included in this survey typically accounted for freight rates and service characteristics (e.g., transit time and reliability). Data sources often varied across the studies. Based on the data they utilized, the surveyed studies are classified as either aggregate or disaggregate. The data in the aggregate studies consist of information on total flows by modes at the regional or national level, while the data in the disaggregate studies pertain to individual shipments. The earlier aggregate studies estimated linear logit models. It has been pointed out that when they are estimated on aggregate data these models are subject to certain shortcom- ings. To avoid these shortcomings, more recent aggregate studies have estimated flexible forms such as translog functions. The disaggregate studies surveyed in this paper used either logit or probit models. Statistical results often varied with the commodities analyzed, making it somewhat difficult to generalize the findings of the different studies. One finding common to several studies is that freight rates have a significant impact on shipment decisions. This paper discusses certain theoretical and empirical limitations of the surveyed studies. It also offers suggestions for future research in freight transport demand. Freight demand models can be used to examine various effects of the recent deregulation in freight transportation.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: An adequate model to study liver regeneration in humans is presently unavailable. We explored the feasibility of studying liver regeneration in a genetically similar species to man, the non-human primate Rhesus macaque. METHODS: Five animals were studied; two underwent 60% hepatectomy, one underwent 30% hepatectomy, and cholecystectomy alone was performed on two animals. Laparoscopic-guided or open liver biopsies were performed on days 1, 2, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 60 following all surgeries. Liver regeneration was evaluated by measuring Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and mitotic index, calculating changes in the surface area of the liver remnant and assessing intrahepatic production of cytokines. RESULTS: Significant liver regeneration was induced in the animals that underwent 60% hepatectomy, peaking between days 21-30 postoperatively. Regeneration was minimal in all other animals studied. Cytokine production followed a similar pattern. Maximal liver regeneration correlated with restoration of surface area in the liver remnant. CONCLUSIONS: Sixty percent hepatectomy in a non-human primate model induced significant liver regeneration, maximizing 21-30 days following partial hepatectomy, suggesting a significant interspecies difference when compared to a rodent hepatectomy model. A partial hepatectomy model in Rhesus macaques may allow further characterization of liver regeneration in a species closer to humans.

historical accident, and take little advantage of human-computer

(VPLs) have begun to address this problem by creating more flexible,
less modal programming environments, and we have taken a step further in
this direction. In this paper, we describe a VPL in which programmers
can modelessly steer as they specify, visualize, explore and alter the

AB  - In this paper, we propose a transportation network efficiency measure that can be used to assess the performance of a transportation network and which differs from other proposed measures, including complex network measures, in that it captures flows, costs, and travel behavior information, along with the topology. The new transportation network efficiency measure allows one to determine the criticality of various nodes (as well as links) as we demonstrate through a network component importance definition, which is well-defined even if the network becomes disconnected. Several illustrative transportation network ex- amples are provided in which the efficiencies and importance of network components are explicitly computed, and their rankings tabulated.

AB  - Neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is involved in the cognitive control of response related action. A frontocentral negative ERP-component, the N2, which probably originates from the ACC, is usually enhanced in conflict-trials that demand an unexpected response. We here used stepped adjustment of response expectation in a response-cueing task, and measured how the N2 varied with global and local cue validity. Results showed that, irrespective of the current cue validity, response times, error rates, and the frontocentral components P2, N2 and P3 increased in unexpected trials. Nevertheless, a N2 was also seen in expected trials, and its latency correlated positively with reaction times, indicating that this potential does not express response conflict only. In line with roles suggested for the ACC, we here propose that the N2 is related to the process of response selection which influences subsequent processing stages reflected in the P3. Unexpected revisions of response programs enhance and delay the N2.

AB  - With recent development in freight transportation industry, its network structure has become more complicated, as many decision-makers competing for profits with each other are involved. While most recent research in this area is focused on the perfectly competitive market and the prices are given as a constant tariff rate, little attention has been paid to the system optimization problem in the absence of regulatory authority. In this paper, we investigate the competitive equilibrium in an oligopolistic market on a freight network. A partially non-cooperative game among shippers, carriers and infrastructure companies (IC) is examined. All three kinds of players act as profit maximizing agents, except that the carriers and ICs are assumed to behave cooperatively in their own coalitions. We consider the vertically efficient nonlinear tariff schedules which are commonly used in the transportation industry. By introducing a three-stage game-theoretic model, we show that the equilibrium flows can also maximize total system profits if the IC and the carrier both use vertically efficient nonlinear pricing schedules. The division of the surplus associated with each shipment is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. We provide a few examples under different situations to show the existence of the resulting equilibrium. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mental time travel (MTT) is the ability to mentally project oneself backward or forward in time, in order to remember an event from one's personal past or to imagine a possible event in one's personal future. Recent work has suggested that, although past and future MTT may rely on shared neurocognitive substrates, the two temporal directions may interact differently with components of this underlying system. Here, we asked 151 participants to recall or imagine past and future autobiographical events in response to high- and low-imageable cue words. The results showed that high- and low-imageable cued events differed markedly on almost all measures, suggesting that imagery acts as a facilitator when constructing both past and possible future events. In line with previous work, future events less often referred to specific events, contained fewer details, and were more positive and idyllic than past events. However, these main effects were qualified by a number of interactions. In particular, we found an increased effect of cue imageability for past as compared to future events, suggesting that the generation of past events is more sensitive to the ability of the cues to invoke the sensory components of the encoding context, whereas the construction of future events is more driven by context-independent schemata.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - Cancer is the second leading disease causing human death. Pre-clinical in vivo studies are essential for translating in vitro laboratory research results into the clinic. Rodents, including the mouse and rat, have been widely used for pre-clinical studies due to their small size, clear genetic backgrounds, rapid propagation, and mature transgenic technologies. However, because rodents are evolutionarily distinct from humans, many pre-clinical research results using rodent models cannot be reproduced in the clinic. Non-human primates (NHPs) may be better animal models than rodents for human cancer research because NHPs and humans share greater similarity in regards to their genetic evolution, immune system, physiology and metabolism. This article reviews the latest progress of cancer research in NHPs by focusing on the carcinogenesis of different NHPs induced by chemical and biological carcinogens. Finally, future research directions for the use of NHPs in cancer research are discussed.

AB  - The presence of three water channels (aquaporins, AQP), AQP1, AQP4 and AQP9 were observed in normal brain and several rodent models of brain pathologies. Little is known about AQP distribution in the primate brain and its knowledge will be useful for future testing of drugs aimed at preventing brain edema formation. We studied the expression and cellular distribution of AQP1, 4 and 9 in the non-human primate brain. The distribution of AQP4 in the non-human primate brain was observed in perivascular astrocytes, comparable to the observation made in the rodent brain. In contrast with rodent, primate AQP1 is expressed in the processes and perivascular endfeet of a subtype of astrocytes mainly located in the white matter and the glia limitans, possibly involved in water homeostasis. AQP1 was also observed in neurons innervating the pial blood vessels, suggesting a possible role in cerebral blood flow regulation. As described in rodent, AQP9 mRNA and protein were detected in astrocytes and in catecholaminergic neurons. However additional locations were observed for AQP9 in populations of neurons located in several cortical areas of primate brains. This report describes a detailed study of AQP1, 4 and 9 distributions in the non-human primate brain, which adds to the data already published in rodent brains. This relevant species differences have to be considered carefully to assess potential drugs acting on AQPs non-human primate models before entering human clinical trials. © 2010 IBRO.

To resolve this issue we propose integrating the indifference-zone (IZ) concept into the multi-objective computing budget allocation (MOCBA) framework. In particular, when IZ is introduced into the MOCBA framework, we address how to determine the probability of non-dominance, how to define the Pareto set, and how to derive allocation rules for the simulation replications. Empirical results show that the MOCBA framework with IZ can significantly save simulation budget when designs to be compared have close performance. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Road traffic impedance is an important part of traffic assignment and has a direct impact on the urban transportation planning, especially on the optimization of urban road network. The BPR function has been the classical traffic impedance since 1960s, which pays more attention on the link level. This paper aims to construct an improved BPR function based on the influencing factors of road traffic impedance, such as the density of intersections, the density of bus stops, non-motor vehicles and saturation. These factors can reflect the difference between road and link. The real data collection from different roads in Dalian are used to calculate the road traffic impedance function by the SPSS software. The results show that the density of intersections, the density of bus stops and saturation have positive effects on unit travel time in Dalian roads. These results not only point out the necessary of influencing factors, but also validates the correctness of the proposed impedance function. In summary, this function has a simple structure and high flexibility so that it is expected to be transplanted to other cities.

AB  - This research is driven by the critical need for a technological breakthrough in taxi-out prediction, and intelligence-based decision making capabilities for an airport operating system. With the advent of sophisticated automation, the use of information-driven intelligent decision support system (IIDSS) to control service operations such as airport has become a necessity to ensure efficiency and throughput. However, airlines, airports, and air traffic controller (ATC), still lack the use of intelligent systems that can assist them in delay prediction, schedule adjustments, and optimal decision making in the face of uncertainties. As per U.S. Govt. Joint Program Development Offices roadmap, new technology is needed to accurately predict delays and efficiently utilize the existing capacity to support the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). Hence, new research is needed to accurately predict taxi-out times which in turn can assist in making schedule adjustments to reduce congestions and delays, and provide a means for better utilization of ground staff of the airlines. We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation scheme for predicting taxi-out times that was tested on data from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport (DTW). Initial results show that the average prediction error for >80% of the flights are <3 min.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - In primates societies th potential for social conflict is high. Primate groups are complex, loosely coordinated, and characterized by a high degree of interdependence among members. The preservation of social order is largely based on the exchange of information among members of the group, each of which has primary responsibility for its own self-maintenance and for obtaining the social satisfactions that contribute to its comfort and well-being. It is not surprising in these circumstances that the individual primate often finds itself in a conflicted state or acting at cross-purposes with other members of its group. Conflict from this perspective is an inevitable accompaniment of social life. Its sources are many, as are the responses which it engenders. A useful distinction can be made between conflicts that occur within the individual (intraindividual) and conflicts that occur between individuals (interpersonal). Both forms of conflict participate closely in the processes contributing to social stability and social change. They are conceptually distinct, however. Intraindividual conflict is present whenever two or more incompatible tendencies are aroused simultaneously. The hallmark of intraindividual conflict in a social context is that the actor is in a state of ambivalence or uncertainty with respect to the perceived consequences of its actions. Extreme or prolonged intraindividual conflict is an aversive state and can have harmful consequences. In contrast to intraindividual conflict, interpersonal conflict is inherently social; it is an emergent property within a social interchange. The defining characteristic of interpersonal conflict is incompatibility between interacting individuals. The efforts of one individual to achieve some desired outcome are thwarted because another individual resists or interferes with these efforts, withdraws from the situation, or in other ways fails to comply. Interpersonal conflict may occur because the participants have different priorities at the moment, or as the result of misunderstanding, fear, ignorance, or mere indifference of one individual to the desires or intentions of another. The interplay between intraindividual conflict and interpersonal conflict is intimate. It is also complex and indirect. Current treatments characteristically emphasize competition as the cause of social conflict and aggression as its principal consequence. This simple formulation is seriously incomplete. It fails to convey the richness, the subtlety, the pervasiveness of conflict, and its powerful influence on the social dynamics or organized primate groups

AB  - The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) contains a small population of neurons expressing preproglucagon. In these neurons preproglucagon is processed to the glucagon-like-peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) and oxyntomodulin. Whereas the neuroanatomy of these neurons is well characterized in rodents the location and projection of preproglucagon neurons have never been described in primates. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the location of preproglucagon neurons and their projections in the non-human primate using radioactive in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization revealed preproglucagon mRNA expressing neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract extending laterally through the intermediate reticular nucleus into the A1 area. Using an antibody raised against rat GLP-2, GLP-2-immunoreactive (- ir) cell bodies were found in the same areas as the preproglucagon mRNA. Only very few GLP-2-ir nerve fibers were observed in the caudal brainstem and mostly in the same areas as the GLP-2-ir cell bodies. The most prominent GLP-2-ir terminal fields were detected in the hypothalamus and rostrally in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis complex. In the hypothalamus, GLP-2-ir fibers arborized extensively in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) and the arcuate nucleus (Arc), the latter containing the densest fiber-plexus. The findings indicate that the brainstem preproglucagon neuronal system is highly conserved between rat and non-human primate with the exception of a much denser innervation of the mediobasal hypothalamus in the primate brain. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In many situations it can be enormously helpful to archive the raw contents of a network traffic stream to disk, to enable later inspection of activity that becomes interesting only in retrospect. We present a Time Machine (TM) for network traffic that provides such a capability. The TM leverages the heavy-tailed nature of network flows to capture nearly all of the likely-interesting traffic while storing only a small fraction of the total volume. An initial proof-of-principle prototype established the forensic value of such an approach, contributing to the investigation of numerous attacks at a site with thousands of users. Based on these experiences, a rearchitected implementation of the system provides flexible, highperformance traffic stream capture, indexing and retrieval, including an interface between the TM and a real-time network intrusion detection system (NIDS). The NIDS controls the TM by dynamically adjusting recording parameters, instructing it to permanently store suspicious activity for offline forensics, and fetching traffic from the past for retrospective analysis. We present a detailed performance evaluation of both stand-alone and joint setups, and report on experiences with running the system live in high-volume environments.

AB  - Wild populations of many non-human primate species have declined alarmingly due to habitat destruction, hunting and genetic isolation. Captive breeding programmes to aid species survival could he enhanced by the use of assisted reproductive techniques, such as artificial insemination (AI), if a source of viable sperm was readily accessible. Cryobanks of primate sperm could provide such a supply if techniques for freezing sperm could be developed. Although sporadic attempts to cryopreserve primate sperm have been reported for some of the more frequently encountered zoo-maintained species, there is limited information available on techniques for sperm collection and storage. It is vital that adequate reporting of all cryopreservation attempts be made to avoid repetition of inappropriate methodologies and wastage of valuable genetic material from rare or endangered animals. An integrated approach to the cryobanking of non-human primate sperm is considered to be essential for species conservation. In this review, the factors affecting the success of sperm cryopreservation are outlined, existing information is compiled from previous reported attempts at cryopreservation, and suggestions are made for cryopreserving sperm in further non-human primate species. Moreover, recommendations are given for additional studies to augment existing data. It is intended that this information should serve as a guide for developing cryopreservation protocols in the future, particularly for endangered species.

AB  - The article discusses about analysis offered by Suddendorf and Busby (2003) about the behavioural criteria for concept of episodic-like memory 'mental time travel'. According to the research program certain points have been raised that supports the claim that only humans are capable of mental time travel (MMT). The points on which the research has been based are; a) animals should be able to declare their memeories through pantomime and behavioral expression b) memory should be shown to use a generative, reconstructive process at retrieval c) episodic memory requires metarepresentation d) episodic memory can be used to construct future plans. The research has proposed three behavioral criteria for episodic-like memory, namely content, structure and flexibility.

AB  - As public health problems such as HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, violence, and environmental toxins become an ever greater part of our national landscape, grassroots public health work has become all the more important. This updated and revised edition of a highly praised volume provides meaningful insights into the systems of inequality in the United States-such as race, class, and gender-that impact health. The book includes timely and powerful case studies of lessons learned and challenges faced in community building and organizing. Several more theoretical essays offer conceptual tools for creating and implementing strategies for community-based approaches to public health. At a time of unprecedented challenges and opportunities for agencies, outside funders, and policy makers, Community Organizing and Community Building for Heath provides the tools for students and professionals who are working to build healthier communities. In its second edition, this classroom favorite includes updated versions of a number of the original chapters, as well as new chapters and appendixes in areas such as using community organizing to influence policy; using the arts in community building and organizing; online activism; and the role of cultural humility and systems change in building effective partnerships between local health departments and community residents.

The actuated displacement is enhanced due to the polymer constraint effect. Both the thermal expansion and apparent Young's modulus of the constrained polymer blocks are significantly improved, compared with the no constraint case. The calculation that agrees well with experimental results provides the means to optimize the design of the constrained polymer stack electrothermal microactuator.

AB  - Delusional beliefs are characteristic of psychosis and, of the delusions, the paranoid delusion is the single most common type associated with psychosis. The many years of research focused on neurocognition in schizophrenia, using standardized neurocognitive tests, have failed to find conclusive cognitive deficits in relation to positive symptoms. However, UK-based psychological research has identified sociocognitive anomalies in relation to paranoid thinking in the form of theory of mind (ToM), causal reasoning and threat-related processing anomalies. Drawing from recent neuroscientific research on the default mode network, this paper asserts that the common theme running through the psychological tests that are sensitive to the cognitive impairment of paranoia is the need to cognitively project the self through time, referred to as mental time travel. Such an understanding of the cognitive roots of paranoid ideation provides a synthesis between psychological and biological accounts of psychosis while also retaining the powerful argument that understanding abnormal thinking must start with models of normal cognition. This is the core theme running through the cognitive psychological literature of psychiatric disorders that enables research from this area to inform psychological therapy.

AB  - Conscious awareness of the self as continuous through time is attributed to the human ability to remember the past and to predict the future, a cogitation that has been called "mental time travel" (MTT). MTT allows one to re-experience one's own past by subjectively "locating" the self to a previously experienced place and time, or to pre-experience an event by locating the self into the future. Here, we used a novel behavioral paradigm in combination with evoked potential mapping and electrical neuroimaging, revealing that MTT is composed of two different cognitive processes: absolute MTT, which is the location of the self to different points in time (past, present, or future), and relative MTT, which is the location of one's self with respect to the experienced event (relative past and relative future). These processes recruit a network of brain areas in distinct time periods including the occipitotemporal, temporoparietal, and anteromedial temporal cortices. Our findings suggest that in addition to autobiographical memory processes, the cognitive mechanisms of MTT also involve mental imagery and self-location, and that relative MTT, but not absolute MTT, is more strongly directed to future prediction than to past recollection.

AB  - The persistence of environmental problems in urban areas and the prospect of increasing congestion have precipitated a variety of new policies in the USA, with concomitant analy- tical and modeling requirements for transportation planning. This paper introduces the Sequenced Activity-Mobility Simulator (SAMS), a dynamic and integrated microsimulation forecasting system for transportation, land use and air quality, designed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional four-step travel demand forecasting systems. The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected exter- nally to be input into the forecasting process.

AB  - Numerical chromosome aberrations in germ cells are important factors contributing to abnormal reproductive outcomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization onto spermatozoa (sperm-FISH) has allowed the study of the influence of a wide range of biological factors and chemical exposure on aneuploidy incidences in human sperm as well as in mouse and rat animal models. The assay presented here extends the applicability of the sperm-FISH method to non-human primates and was tested in the prevalent model species, the rhesus macaque. The assay provides probes for macaque chromosomes 17, 18, 19, 20, X and Y, the homologues of human chromosomes 13, 18, 19, 16, X and Y, respectively. The analysis of 11 000 spermatozoa each from five individuals revealed spontaneous sex chromosomal disomy frequencies (X: 0.08%; Y: 0.09%) and an average autosomal disomy frequency (0.03%) coinciding with some of the lowest incidences scored in human studies. The non-human primate sperm-FISH assay provides a fast and efficient tool complementing the available analysis methods in non-human primate exposure studies. Since the assay employs large locus-specific FISH probes representing evolutionary conserved DNA sequences, it can be expected that the assay is also applicable to other cercopithecoid and hominoid non-human primate species.

AB  - In combination, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) are innovative and aggressive efforts to move US cities toward integrated transportation and air quality planning. Under these complementary laws, air quality has become a major national transportation goal. In areas with serious air pollution, air quality will be a major consideration in determining the future shape of urban transportation. This paper considers how the CAAA and ISTEA combine to provide an innovative national policy approach of interest to countries seeking to encourage sustainable development in urban centers. The CAAA mandates measurable and enforceable air quality targets. Nation-wide standards are set for acceptable levels of carbon monoxide, ground level ozone, and small particulates. ISTEA includes directions for transportation planners and decision-makers to follow to reach air quality and other goals - transportation planning must emphasize system effi- ciency, and for cities with severe air pollution, transportation projects are expected to contribute to cleaner air. Each urban area has flexibility in how it applies this framework to reflect its priorities and solve its problems. Strict federal sanctions provide incentives for compliance with both laws. Enactment of these laws has produced a period of transition and uncertainty as well as of challenge and opportunity for planners and elected officials. The next several years, the US will provide one national laboratory and over 100 different urban laboratories for innovative approaches to integrate transportation and environmental policies to resolve major urban problems.

Experiments with scrub-jays, rats and non-human primates have investigated whether MTT is uniquely human by examining the abilities of these animals to remember what, where and when an event occurred and to anticipate future events. We argue that animal memory for when an event happened must be distinguished from memory for how long ago it happened to properly evaluate parallels with human capabilities. Similarly, tests of future MTT in animals must show that they are planning for a specific time in the future to demonstrate qualitative comparability with human MTT.

The aggregate volume of travel is being viewed, for the first time, as something to be minimized rather than maximized. Within this context, localities and metropolitan planning organizations have freedom to innovate in their selection of transportation system performance measures. This paper proposes a unified set of performance measures that is based on the minimization of vehicle hours of travel (VHT) per capita. This approach promotes efficiency of both land use patterns and transportation networks.

Assuming that the system can access statistical information of the aggregated traffic demands between source-destination pairs or zones in the transportation network, traffic congestion can be reduced by using the total travel time of the system as a measure in a traffic assignment model.

AB  - Compact city development has, over the last 20 years or so, emerged as the preferred response to the goal of sustainable development. As such, it is pertinent to examine planning practices to see whether the traditional economic bias in planning is now balanced by aims and practices in support of environmental and social sustainability. In this light the social, environmental, and economic goals linked to densification and mixed use development will be the main focus of this article. In addition, the article assesses whether distinct institutional practices support the balancing of these goals. The empirical basis is formed by urban plans in four Scandinavian cities in combination with qualitative interview data. The article concludes that on a discursive level, social, environmental and economic goals are represented in compact city strategies. Institutionalised practices, however, show that economic goals remain at the core of planning. Environmental and social aims still play second fiddle, but new measures are in development that may gradually strengthen their influence over urban development practices.

AB  - A review of the literature was conducted to provide an overview of organophosphorus (OP)-induced morphological changes in the non-human primate. Most studies have evaluated effects of the OP nerve agent soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate), an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Soman-induced acute and chronic morphological changes have been examined. The effects of nerve agent therapy (i.e. pyridostigmine, praloxidime chloride and atropine), with and without an anticonvulsant (i.e. diazepam, midazolam), on soman-induced lesions have also been studied. Acute changes in the central nervous system of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to soman alone or soman and therapy, without an anticonvulsant, were characterized by neuronal degeneration and necrosis and neuropil edema. The lesions were usually present in the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, amygdaloid complex, caudate nucleus, thalamus and hippocampus. Morphologically, these lesions resemble lesions produced by hypoxic-ischemic injury or by seizures and are similar to soman-induced changes in other laboratory animals. Nerve agent therapy supplemented with an anticonvulsant reduced or prevented soman-induced acute neural lesions. Acute changes in non-neural tissues were limited to the heart (e.g. hemorrhage, myofiber necrosis, myocarditis) and skeletal muscle (e.g. myofiber necrosis). Heart lesions in the non-human primate are similar to OP-induced heart lesions in man. The pathogenesis of the acute lesions in both the central nervous system and heart is discussed. Consistent soman-induced chronic morphological changes have not been produced in the rhesus monkey or baboon.

This paper proposes a paradigm that establishes conjugal conflict and violence as separate entities. According to the paradigm, conjugal conflict is viewed as "an inevitable part of human association," whereas conjugal violence is determined to be a learned behavioral tactic that is employed as a coping strategy when an individual's conflict threshold potential is exceeded. Evidence will be offered that violence is learned from family of origin and from observing what is common or accepted practice in the community.

Applying acrylic delays and further complicates surgical procedure, and overheating during the curing process can cause damage to the bone. Post-surgery, acrylic margins can give rise to bacterial growth and infection. Here we describe a method to develop custom implants which conform to the individual's skull, thereby eliminating the need for acrylic. This method shortens surgery time and significantly improves the hygiene of chamber margins. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - In no possible world does a time traveler succeed in killing her earlier self before she ever enters a time machine. So if many, many time travelers went back in time trying to kill their unprotected former selves, the time travelers would fail in many strange, "coincidental" ways, slipping on banana peels, killing the wrong victim, and so on. Such cases produce doubts about time travel. How could "coincidences" be guaranteed to happen? And wouldn't the certainty of coincidental failure imply that time travelers are not free to kill their earlier selves? But if so, what would inhibit their freedom? Despite initial appearances, these and other doubts may be answered: the possibility of time travel survives yet another challenge.

AB  - With a daily average output of 123,800 bbl. this year, Mexico ranks as the world's seventh largest oil-producing nation. Oil is Mexico's fourth-largest industry but it is almost entirely controlled by foreign firms, which currently have a $450,000,000 investment in it. This has long rankled nationalistic Mexicans, who not only covet the foreign-held oil fields but see justification in Mexico's taking them, since a Mexican legal principle from the time when the country was a Spanish colony until 1857 held that the Government owned all subsoil rights. From 1884 until 1917, however, Mexican law gave the surface landowner the petroleum rights and it was during this period that the world's great oil companies got their wells drilled into Mexican soil. When Mexico reverted to the old subsoil law in 1917 there was a gush of argument whether the law should be retroactive. But Ambassador Dwight Morrow in 1928 sewed up the rights of U. S. companies in an agreement with President Calles which has since been upheld by the Mexican Supreme Court. Mexico's Presidency is now occupied by New Dealing Lázaro Cárdenas. Fortnight ago, after six months of labor trouble in the oil fields which has threatened the stability of the Mexican Government, President Cárdenas disregarded the Calles-Morrow agreement, expropriated some 850,000 acres of undeveloped oil-land leased by foreigners (TIME, Nov. 15). Last week, while foreign oil companies threatened to leave Mexico, and relations between the Mexican and U. S. Governments were under greater strain than at any time for years, President Cárdenas further confused the subject by promising to lease (but not leasing) to a British firm the rights to the undeveloped portions of the Poza Rica field, second in richness only to the Iraq field. The present Mexican oil crisis began last May with a nation-wide strike by oilworkers for more pay and shorter hours. Since foreign oil companies pay 7% of Mexico's taxes, a prolonged strike threatened Government finances as well as those of the foreign oil companies. After two weeks, therefore, President Cárdenas intervened, commissioned a group of Government experts to investigate. Two months later in a 3,250-page report the experts ordered 17 foreign companies to raise wages some $7,000,000 (TIME, Aug. 16). Contending that the report was "grossly unfair," the companies refused to pay the increase, offered to settle with an increase of $3,000,000. Since then the matter has been under consideration by the Mexican Board of Arbitration and Conciliation, which has also had to consider an unusually strong warning from U. S. Ambassador to Mexico Josephus Daniels, who threatened that "anything that would disturb the status quo and good relations would be regretted." Last week foreign oil companies, already vastly excited over the expropriation, suddenly heard a rumor that the Board of Arbitration was about to decide in favor of the $7,000,000 wage increase previously ordered. Immediately the oilmen got together, announced that they would "suspend operations" and abandon the country rather than pay it. It was at that point that President Cárdenas, who has plenty of resolute and resourceful Indian blood in his veins, called in representatives of Mexican Eagle Oil Co., affiliate of British Royal Dutch-Shell which already controls 60% of Mexican oil production. He handed them an agreement promising them full control of the Poza Rica field, 7,700 of whose 13,000 proven acres Eagle already holds. In return Eagle agreed to give Mexico 15% to 35% of the petroleum it produced, varying with type and amount. Britain and Germany both began bargaining to buy from Mexico whatever portion of this oil royalty Mexican industry does not consume. From the British point of view the concession is like money from home. It gives Great Britain a huge oil reserve which can be reached without passing through the Mediterranean, where she no longer has undisputed control. From the U. S. point of view the move looked like an astute means of splitting the unified stand of the foreign oil companies on the wage question. After the U. S., 3,455,000 bbl.; Russia, 517,000 bbl.; Venezuela, 502,000 bbl.; Iran, 191,000 bbl.; Netherlands Indies, 148,000 bbl.; Rumania, 146,000 bbl.

AB  - In no possible world does a time traveler succeed in killing her earlier self before she ever enters a time machine. So if many, many time travelers went back in time trying to kill their unprotected former selves, the time travelers would fail in many strange, "coincidental" ways, slipping on banana peels, killing the wrong victim, and so on. Such cases produce doubts about time travel. How could "coincidences" be guaranteed to happen? And wouldn't the certainty of coincidental failure imply that time travelers are not free to kill their earlier selves? But if so, what would inhibit their freedom? Despite initial appearances, these and other doubts may be answered: the possibility of time travel survives yet another challenge.

AB  - Does foreign military assistance strengthen or further weaken fragile states facing internal conflict? We address this question by estimating how U.S. military aid affects violence and electoral participation in Colombia. We exploit the allocation of U.S. military aid to Colombian military bases, and compare how aid affects municipalities with and without bases. Using detailed political violence data, we find that U.S. military aid leads to differential increases in attacks by paramilitaries (who collude with the military), but has no effect on guerilla attacks or coca production. Aid increases also result in more paramilitary (but not guerrilla) homicides during election years. Moreover, when military aid rises, voter turnout falls more in base municipalities, especially those that are politically contested. Our results are robust to an instrument based on worldwide increases in U.S. military aid (excluding Latin America). The findings suggest that foreign military assistance may strengthen armed non-state actors, undermining domestic political institutions.

AB  - Current trends in public transportation have led to an increased interest in smart ticketing systems. Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - It has been predicted that the use of non-human primates (NHPs) is going to increase considerably in the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Opportunities exist to focus on a rigorous, science-based approach to drug development, however, which will minimize this increase. In this article, the authors review current and future NHP use in mAb development based on surveys, experience and expert opinion and propose a framework that will minimize future NHP use and continue to support science and innovation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Nigeria as a nation has since independence been involved in conflict resolution in various parts of the world, especially Africa. For Nigeria, the defence and promotion of world peace ranks as one of the pillars of her foreign policy objectives. In keeping with this, she has demonstrated her willingness to cooperate and to act in concert with other peace-loving members of the comity of nations. In her sub-region, Nigeria has led other members to contain conflict and maintain peace in a region that is conflict prone. She has been able to achieve this because of her possession of leverage and resources, relative to her neighbours. Her search for peace and security has been pursued through bilateral, multilateral and via regional security architecture of which she is a pivotal leader. Nigeria has been involved in conflict resolution since 1963 when she sent troops to Congo on a peace keeping mission in that country. There are other peace engagements that she has spearheaded such as the peaceful resolution of the differences between Togo and Republic of Benin in 1975. Nigeria equally spearheaded the deployment of troops in Chad during the imbroglio in that country. Nigeria saved OAU from disintegration with her timely recognition of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Nigerian's leadership role in conflict resolution in Africa was once again manifested in the formation of ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), which was formed for peacekeeping mission in the Liberia crisis. Nigeria was the largest financier of that mission and ECOMOG did not only resolve the conflict in Liberia but also the conflict in Sierra Leone. Nigeria has also played a major role in the conflict in Darfur in Sudan over the crisis in that country. Nigeria played an important role in ending apartheid regime in South Africa. Nigeria believes in the use of diplomatic means in resolving issue rather that using force. This chapter is an effort to advance understanding of the endemic conflict system that has brought untold human tragedy to the African continent. The task undertaken in this paper attempts to conceptualise conflict, then analyse the causes of conflict and explore its magnitude and consequences as a means of assessing the role for Nigeria in view of the new paradigm shift in the emerging conflict resolution architecture.

AB  - The challenge of funding renewal plans for water networks is not only in financing but in scheduling as well. Therefore, there is an essential need to prioritize the allocation of funds (budget) to candidate projects, to select the optimal rehabilitation alternative(s), and to develop short and long-term rehabilitation plans for the entire network. A simulation-based priority index (PI) model is developed using an integrated analytic hierarchy process (AHP)/multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT). Qualitative data are collected from practitioners across North America and water network data are collected from two main municipalities in Canada. Two procedures of selecting rehabilitation alternatives (PSRAs) are employed including (1) breakage rate and (2) condition assessment. An automated web-based budget allocation index (BAI-Prioritizer) is developed to prioritize budget allocation to various water network projects. This paper presents the process of developing that web-based decision support tool. The developed PI model assists in building a renewal plan for a water network. The developed model and methodology are applied to two case studies in order to demonstrate their capabilities. The developed research is relevant to researchers and practitioners (municipal engineers, consultants, and contractors) in order to support decisions, prioritize water mains, and plan for budget allocation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Current models of autobiographical memory suggest that self-identity guides autobiographical memory retrieval. Further, the capacity to recall the past and imagine one’s self in the future (mental time travel) can inﬂuence social problem solving. We examined whether manipulating self-identity, through an induction task in which students were led to believe they possessed high or low self-efﬁcacy, impacted episodic speciﬁcity and content of retrieved and imagined events, as well as social problem solving. Compared to individuals in the low self efﬁcacy group, individuals in the high self efﬁcacy group generated past and future events with greater (a) speciﬁcity, (b) positive words, and (c) self-efﬁcacious statements, and also performed better on social problem solving indices. A lack of episodic detail for future events predicted poorer performance on social problem solving tasks. Strategies that increase perceived self-efﬁcacy may help individuals to selectively construct a past and future that aids in negotiating social problems.

AB  - The politically-charged notion of network neutrality came to the fore in the first decade of the 21st century, using analogy from transportation as one of the key tools in motivating arguments. This paper examines how the various notions around network neutrality (common carriage, regulation, price discrimination) have historically played out in the transportation sector, and suggests some of the current arguments fail to understand the nuances of how complex networks actually operate to serve the many demands placed on them.

AB  - The paper provides analytical evidence of the added-value of flexibility for air transportation systems. More specifically, the impact of a new innovative modular aircraft on the operations of an airline is deeply analyzed. The impact analysis is carried out with an integrated schedule planning model which presents a combination of appropriate optimization and behavioral modeling methodologies. The results show that the flexible system uses the transportation capacity more efficiently by carrying more passengers with less overall capacity. Moreover, it is observed that the flexible system deals better with insufficient transportation capacity. Furthermore, the scheduling decisions are robust to the estimated cost figures of the new system. For the analyzed range of costs, it is always carrying more passengers with less allocated capacity compared to a standard system.
