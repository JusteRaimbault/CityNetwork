"The socio-spatial dynamics of systems of cities and innovation processes: a multi-level model";"484546251878757817";"2008";"Following a first attempt presented as the SIMPOP model (a multi-agents systems whose prototype is described in Bura et al. 1996), our aim is to develop a generic model for simulating the evolution of systems of towns and cities, using the SWARM simulation platform. The scientific issue is: to understand how cities that are interconnected through material and immaterial networks co-evolve, within an environment where social and economic innovation continuously emerge, while maintaining at a macro-geographical scale functional, hierarchic and spatial differentiation which evolve at a much slower pace. The SIMPOP2 model is designed for testing hypothesis about the general processes of urbanisation and interactions between towns and cities. The objective is to identify and order the rules and parameters that have produced a variety of configuration at the level of the systems of cities, according mainly to the changing conditions of spatial interaction: communication means, transportation speed, range of trading activities, proximity networks and long distance connectivity. Three main varieties of urban systems that have had different histories of urbanisation and conditions of circulation will be investigated: developed countries with old settlement systems, developed countries of much more recent urbanisation, and developing countries. A first generic version of the model includes the minimal rules that seem necessary for reproducing the emergence and evolution of any system of cities, whereas three different scenarios will be constructed for simulating the characteristic features of the three main variations.";"Denise Pumain,"
"Half a billion simulations: Evolutionary algorithms and distributed computing for calibrating the SimpopLocal geographical model";"5750425554346314152";"2014";"Multi-agent geographical models integrate very large numbers of spatial interactions. In order to validate those models large amount of computing is necessary for their simulation and calibration. Here a new data processing chain including an automated calibration procedure is experimented on a computational grid using evolutionary algorithms. This is applied for the first time to a geographical model designed to simulate the evolution of an early urban settlement system. The method enables us to reduce the computing time and provides robust results. Using this method, we identify several parameter settings that minimise three objective functions that quantify how closely the model results match a reference pattern. As the values of each parameter in different settings are very close, this estimation considerably reduces the initial possible domain of variation of the parameters. The model is thus a useful tool for further multiple applications on empirical historical situations.";"Sébastien Rey-Coyrehourcq,Clara Schmitt,Denise Pumain,Romain Reuillon,"

However, the extent to which port geography constituted a specific research stream within human geography remained largely unanswered. By reviewing 399 port papers published in major geography journals, the authors critically investigated the trends and changing tides of port geography research. The findings point out the emergence of the core community shifting from mainstream geography research to increasing connection with other disciplines, notably transport studies. The paper offers a progressive view on human geographers' abilities to form a research community on port development, while identifying opportunities in the pursuit of collaboration between different academic disciplines.";"K.

" Video games and urban simulation: new tools or new tricks?";"15363435225343605206";"2012";"Video games allow complex systems modelling, revealing retroaction loops, replicating self-organization and the emergence of hierarchical organization, functional differentiation and social segregation through multi-level interactions. Recent trends focus on improving modelling tools’ graphic quality and interface attractiveness and on using video games to facilitate urban studies teaching and research. This apparent convergence between simulation and video games is addressed through a selection of strategy and city builder video games. Comparisons reveal that simulations and video games point to similar results:, they both allow the simulation of complex urban processes, like hierarchical urban networks or urban segregation. Games even seem to allow going one step further, being often more comprehensive simulations. However, the main limitation of video games emerges from their didactic power: video games and simulation software implement rules and models in almost opposite means. Games induce players to learn the model but not to challenge or to produce new knowledge.";"Hovig Ter Minassian,Samuel Rufat,"

"Smart Cities in developing economies: A literature review and policy insights";"2698781779630880642";"2015";"— Now-a-days all the cities of developed and developing countries feel the need to provide public services in a most effective and efficient way. It is also noted that a considerable number of rural population is converging to the cities to relish the fruits of development and this pace of migration is increasing rapidly. From global experience it is seen that pace of growth of urbanization up to 30% is not very fast but thereafter at least up to 60-65% this pace of growth increases rapidly. Statistics highlights that now the urban population in India is 31%. As a result, pace of urbanization would speed-up to combat the need of inhabitants of those cities. In this context the Government of India has decided to set up 100  Smart Cities  in India (as observed from the budget speech of Finance Minister of India in 2014) to face the situation since if this is right now not achieved, the existing cities would very soon become unlivable. However to achieve this,  Smart Technology  is essential which in particular, means improvement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) along with other essential services. Now some basic principles are required to be adopted by the cities marked for converting them as  Smart Cities  . These are Coalescence, Practicality and Involvement. In this paper a sincere attempt has been taken to characterize the essentials of  Smart Cities  in the context of developing countries and to find out the main constraints apprehended to stand on the way to convert cities to  Smart Cities  or to denevo create  Smart Cities  . Criteria have been proposed to identify as to which cities would be construed to be fit for conversion to  Smart Cities  . In the conclusion part it has been inferred that out of other barriers literacy and fund constraint are the principal barriers and it has been suggested that Government should sincerely pique the people to come out from the veil of illiteracy and Government should essay to explore wealth resources needed for establishing  Smart Cities  .";"Sheshadri Chatterjee,Arpan Kumar Kar,"
"L'apport des images satellites dans l'analyse comparée des espaces périurbains des métropoles du sud-ouest européen";"16026355925038810589";"2007";"La problématique des espaces périurbains se trouve depuis une trentaine d’années au premier plan des réflexions sur les villes européennes. Leur caractérisation et leur comparaison focalisent les interrogations des chercheurs mais aussi des décideurs. Cette thèse est centrée sur la question de l’identification des limites du périurbain et de sa structure spatiale, non pour tenter de le définir comme une catégorie de l’urbain, mais pour comprendre les processus en jeu dans cet espace périphérique. Elle développe une analyse comparative en intégrant les espaces périurbains de sept métropoles du sud-ouest de l'Europe (Barcelone, Lisbonne, Madrid, Porto, Bordeaux, Toulouse et Montpellier) et elle se fonde sur des observations renouvelées par l’utilisation de la télédétection. Par la valorisation d’une nouvelle technique de lecture des images satellites et grâce à la précision permise par SPOT 5, la recherche précise les modalités des structurations spatiales et la nature des activités installées dans cette partie des villes, considérée jusqu’alors comme une périphérie essentiellement résidentielle. Elle met particulièrement en évidence le rôle de la distance au centre de la métropole et des grands axes routiers dans l’urbanisation de ces espaces. Elle montre également leur grande diversité.  Issues related to suburban areas have been for about thirty years at the forefront of discussions about European cities. Their characterisation and their comparison concentrate questions not only from researchers, but also from decision makers. This thesis focuses on the identification of the limits of suburban areas and of their spatial structure, not to try and define them as a category of urban areas, but to understand the processes at stake in these outlying areas. It develops a comparative analysis through the integration of the suburban areas of seven major cities of Southwest Europe (Barcelona, Lisbon, Madrid, Porto, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Montpellier) and is based on observations renewed using remote sensing. Through the promotion of a new interpretation approach of satellite images and thanks to the accuracy allowed by Spot 5, the research specifies the conditions of spatial structuring and the type of activities set up in this part of the cities, which was considered mainly as a residential periphery until then. It particularly highlights the role of the distance to the centre of the major city, as well as of the major trunk roads, in the urbanisation of these areas. It also shows their wide diversity.";"Pierre Albert,"
" A New Method to Evaluate Simulation Models: The Calibration Profile (CP) Algorithm";"15726759740229850049";"2015";"© 2015 JASSS. Models of social systems generally contain free parameters that cannot be evaluated directly from data. A calibration phase is therefore necessary to assess the capacity of the model to produce the expected dynamics. However, despite the high computational cost of this calibration it doesn't produce a global picture of the relationship between the parameter space and the behaviour space of the model. The Calibration Profile (CP) algorithm is an innovative method extending the concept of automated calibration processes. It computes a profile that depicts the effect of each single parameter on the model behaviour, independently from the others. A 2-dimensional graph is thus produced exposing the impact of the parameter under study on the capacity of the model to produce expected dynamics. The first part of this paper is devoted to the formal description of the CP algorithm. In the second part,we apply it to an agent based geographical model (SimpopLocal). The analysis of the results brings to light novel insights on the model.";"Clara Schmitt,Jean Baptiste Mouret,Romain Reuillon,Ricardo De Aldama,"
"Spatially explicit inverse modeling for urban planning";"10473726185885497239";"2012";"Urban modeling methods have traditionally followed a forward modeling approach. That is, they use data from today's situation to forecast or simulate future states of an urban system. In this paper, we propose an inverse modeling approach by which we shift our attention from solely forecasting or simulating future states of an urban system to steering it to a desired state in the future via key variables characterizing the system in the present. We first present a theoretical framework for the use of the inverse approach in urban planning. We test the power of the proposed method using a hedonic house price model in a metropolitan area in Switzerland to investigate the negative effects of densification on house prices. The model is calibrated by mixed geographically weighted regression in order to account for spatial variability of both key variables and model outputs.We show how devaluation of house prices caused by densification can be compensated by different levels of socioeconomic, locational as well as structural variables. We illustrate and discuss how trade-offs between variables may lead to more feasible results from an urban planning perspective. We conclude that the proposed method might be valuable for urban planners for developing implementable spatial plans based on future visions. In particular, the fact that other model specifications than hedonic house price model can also be employed to formulate an inverse model application, allows planners to address other type of problems or externalities from urbanization processes such as urban sprawls, environmental pollution or land uses change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.";"R Crespo,A Grêt-Regamey,"
" Complexity, cognition and the city";"12899164016634241157";"2013";"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.";"A.G Fallis,"

We use the publication records (in the Science Citation Index) of two emerging technologies to study the mechanisms of diffusion in the case of two innovation trajectories: small interference RNA (siRNA) and nano-crystalline solar cells (NCSC). Methods for analyzing and visualizing geographical and cognitive diffusion are specified as indicators of different dynamics. Geographical diffusion is illustrated with overlays to Google Maps  cognitive diffusion is mapped using an overlay to a map based on the ISI Subject Categories. The evolving geographical networks show both preferential attachment and small-world characteristics. The strength of preferential attachment decreases over time, while the network evolves into an oligopolistic control structure with small-world characteristics. The transition from disciplinary-oriented (mode-1) to transfer-oriented (mode-2) research is suggested as the crucial difference in explaining the different rates of diffusion between siRNA and NCSC.";"Ismael Rafols,Loet Leydesdorff,"

" Cities, cells, and complexity: Developing a research agenda for urban geocomputation";"13986924841969357285";"2000";"Cellular automata are widely employed in urban geocomputation and have been applied to urban systems simulation with a recent fervour. Despite the popularity of these models, however, researchers have been slow to heed the doubts and disclaimers expressed in the early days of their application to urban phenomena. This is, in part, a response to advances in the field. However, many of these concerns remain as appropriate today as they did in the 1980s, and have not been addressed largely because the study of cellular urban modelling, and the broader field of urban geocomputation, lacks a defined research agenda. This paper addresses an apparent imbalance in the field and re-evaluates the research agenda of urban geocomputation, in particular cellular-based modelling of urban systems, pre-emptively suggesting future avenues for exploration and considering the challenges that might lie ahead.";"Paul M.

Un questionnement sous-jacent à cette analyse concerne la possibilité que certaines idées, concepts ou approches en sciences régionales diffèrent entre le Canada et l'Europe. Les résultats montrent que les comportements d'innovation varient à la fois spatialement (selon l'accessibilité aux interlocuteurs), mais aussi selon le territoire.

In light of this tradition, the global city is described here in its various theoretical guises, in a chronological account from the early 1900s roots to present-day formulations, in order to establish an eclectic understanding that can speak beyond the college, opening the dialogue on globalisation and cities beyond urban studies. In this sense, the essay describes the 'global city' as the status of connectedness to the global attained by some world cities, which rests upon an urban entrepreneurial spirit that situates these metropolises as the strategic hinges of globalisation.";"M.

"Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of urban planning implementation effectiveness: Evidence from five urban master plans of Beijing";"10357216934824393352";"2012";"Evaluation of urban planning implementation (UPI) has attracted extensive attention from urban planners and researchers in recent years. Existing literature, however, mainly focuses on the conformity approach and does not take the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of UPI into account. In addition, previous research failed to distinguish the effects of urban planning from other institutional forces, as well as market incentives on urban expansion. To bridge this gap, we proposed a spatiotemporal approach to evaluate the effectiveness of UPI based on logistic regression and geographical information system (GIS) by identifying the spatiotemporal heterogeneous effects of urban planning on urban expansion. An empirical research was conducted in the Beijing Metropolitan Area (BMA) by analyzing five urban master plans drafted in 1958, 1973, 1982, 1992 and 2004. Five periods from 1947 to 2008 were examined to evaluate the dynamic effects of each master plan and other related factors. The effects of the 2004 Urban Master Plan on 16 districts in Beijing were estimated to identify the spatial variations of UPI. Within the context of China's booming economy, the results indicate that the effects of urban planning during the urban expansion increase over time, and are significantly stronger in exurban areas than in central cities and suburban areas. In addition, based on logistic regression results, we adopted an existing urban expansion simulation model to geographically visualize the impact of urban planning on future urban expansion, namely urban planning implementation effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..";"Haoying Han,Ying Long,Yizhen Gu,"

This context introduces the importance of quantifying the impacts resulting from land artificialization increase, the assessment of coastal erosion and the development of strategies for achieving an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). In this study we employed the Land Transformation Model (LTM) to forecast urban growth to year 2014 in the South Coast of São Miguel Island, Azores (Portugal). Two different scenarios formodeling urban growth were tested: (1) one that considered an urban sprawl trend equivalent to the one measured between years 1998 and 2005, and (2) another that considered the restrictions included in the intervention area of South Coast Management Plan (POOC Costa Sul). The objective was to evaluate the impact of the POOC Costa Sul in the urban growth of the studied area. Results show that the POOC Costa Sul is not effective in containing urban growth quantities which are equivalent to the non-restricted scenario. However, it was possible to observe that it is effective in deciding where the urban expansion is likely to happen, preventing, for instances, the occurrence of urban growth near water lines or in the maritime public domain. We conclude that this type of models can be very relevant to manage and monitor coastal management plans. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.";"Pedro Cabral,Raquel Medeiros,"

Green is at the centre of this imagineering, which situates environmental sustainability at the core of Sydney's competitive and innovative edge. Yet the Harbour City, while rising to worldwide fame, has also been progressively troubled by wicked challenges that question its increasingly entrepreneurial and largely unproblematized approach to urban governance. At present, the metropolis has tackled these challenges by means of ad hoc solutions and policy-making processes that, on deeper analysis, reveal little coordination beyond an impetus for growth as the driver of collective action at the urban scale. Due to the lack of a clear metropolis-wide authority and the multiscalar nature of urban governance, the city has turned too much towards tackling sustainability within its urban dimension as a source of global competitiveness, while social polarization questions are steadily advancing to the forefront. It is time, I argue, for a Greater Sydney Authority. © 2011 Urban Research Publications Limited.";"Michele Acuto,"
"Influence of incentive networks on landscape changes: A simple agent-based simulation approach";"7648047597476395435";"2013";"The aim of this paper is to implement a simple model for exploring the influence of different multi-scale incentive networks affecting farmer decision on landscape changes. Three scales of networks are considered: a global 'policy' network promoting specific land uses, an intermediate 'social' network where land use practices are shared and promoted collectively and a local 'neighborhood' network where land use practices are influenced by those of their neighbors. We assess the respective and combined influence of these networks on landscape pattern (fragmentation and heterogeneity) and dynamics, taking into account agronomic constraints (assimilated to crop successions). Simulations show that combination of incentive networks does not have linear and/or cumulative influence on landscape changes. Comparison of simulated scenarios highlights that a combination of two networks tends to improve landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation  scenarios combining all networks could lead to two opposite landscape configuration illustrating emergence of landscape dynamics. Finally, this study emphasizes that landscape complexity has also to be understood through the multiplicity of pathways of landscape changes rather than the assessment of the resulting landscape patterns. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";"N.

" Assessing the quality of multilevel graph clustering";"17666479849692305431";"2014";"“Lifting up” a non-hierarchical approach to handle hierarchical clustering by iteratively applying the approach to hierarchically cluster a graph is a popular strategy. However, these lifted iterative strategies cannot reasonably guide the overall nesting process precisely because they fail to evaluate the very hierarchical character of the clustering they produce. In this study, we develop a criterion that can evaluate the quality of the subgraph hierarchy. The multilevel criterion we present and discuss in this paper generalizes a measure designed for a one-level (flat) graph clustering to take nesting of the clusters into account. We borrow ideas from standard techniques in algebraic combinatorics and exploit a variable qq to keep track of the depth of clusters at which edges occur. Our multilevel measure relies on a recursive definition involving variable qq outputting a one-variable polynomial. This paper examines archetypal examples as proofs-of-concept  these simple cases are useful in understanding how the multilevel measure actually works. We also apply this multilevel modularity to real world networks to demonstrate how it can be used to compare hierarchical clusterings of graphs.";"François Queyroi,Maylis Delest,Jean Marc Fédou,Guy Melançon,"

Urban areas are hypothesized to have higher diversification in the degree of imperviousness than rural areas. Principal Component Analysis and Canonical Correlation Analysis were used to verify the spatial coherency between land imperviousness and the distribution of urban land-use. Land imperviousness Pielou index increased linearly with both diversity in the use of land and ancillary variables assessing the urban gradient (population density and distance from the inner city). Our study identifies urban and rural municipalities respectively as the most and the less diversified in terms of land-use and imperviousness intensity, with suburban areas ranking in-between. Pielou evenness index applied to land imperviousness maps and the notion of land-use diversification are promising tools to monitoring city hierarchy along urban gradients.";"Luca Salvati,Efthimia Saradakou,Efstathios Grigoriadis,Adele Sateriano,"
"Mapping accessibility in Belgium: a tool for land-use and transport planning?";"13309391849131190562";"2009";"This paper compares the spatial structure of car accessibility to towns and to railway stations during peak and off-peak hours in Belgium for the country's 2616 municipalities. A clustering method is applied. It is shown that in a highly urbanised country, the situation is far from being spatially equitable in terms of accessibility, and some areas are more favoured than others. Congestion increases spatial inequalities, differently according to absolute or relative measures of change. By means of examples, this paper shows that even simple accessibility indicators could be useful to support decisions taken by planners and politicians (e.g. as regards the development of residential, industrial and business park areas). Maps indicate the spatial inequalities in terms of accessibility to urban centres and transport nodes, and the impact of congestion on these inequalities. The absolute and relative time losses due to congestion affect different areas in different ways. The location of new developments further increases the congestion problem and the spatial disparities. This paper also insists on the caution that should be adopted when measuring and interpreting accessibility, its measurements, its inputs, its temporal changes in absolute and relative terms as well as the need for spatially disaggregated data. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Selecting among five common modelling approaches for integrated environmental assessment and management";"17472739330915455751";"2013";"[Highlights] \n[::] We review five common integrated modelling approaches.\n[::] Model choice considers purpose, data type, scale and uncertainty treatment.\n[::] We present a guiding framework for selecting the most appropriate approach.\n\n[Abstract]\nThe design and implementation of effective environmental policies need to be informed by a holistic understanding of the system processes (biophysical, social and economic), their complex interactions, and how they respond to various changes. Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.";"Serena Hamilton,Alexey Voinov,Olivier Barreteau,Sondoss ElSawah,Holger Maier,Sakari Kuikka,Mark Borsuk,Hedwig van Delden,Anthony Jakeman,Hans Henriksen,Andrea Rizzoli,Rebecca Kelly Letcher,"

" Une théorie géographique des villes";"9332685664450147168";"2011";"« théorie évolutive des villes », qui\nconstruit une explication, du point de vue géographique,\nde leurs inégalités et de leurs différences en termes de\ntaille, de rayonnement et de profil socio-économique,\net qui autorise dans une certaine mesure d’en prévoir\nl’évolution\npag 5\n\n\nLa mise au point de bases de données comparatives\net l’observation plus rigoureuse des transformations\nsociales et économiques des villes sur des durées\nassez longues nous ont permis d’identifier des traits\ncommuns et des spécificités des trajectoires des villes\ndans l’espace abstrait de leur diversité socio-économi-\nque (Pumain & Saint-Julien, 1978) et d’en proposer\nune interprétation générale\np. 6\n\n\nQue dit une théorie géographique des villes ? Elle se\nfonde sur l’idée que les villes ne sont jamais isolées, mais\nse développent en relation avec de multiples réseaux,\nqui les ont progressivement rendues mutuellement in-\nterdépendantes. C’est en raison de la force de ces inter-\ndépendances que j’ai proposé l’expression de « système\nde villes » (Pumain, 1992).\np. 6\n\nDans la longue durée de\nl’histoire des sociétés humaines, les systèmes de villes\npeuvent ainsi apparaître comme une invention extrê-\nmement durable, un instrument adaptatif de gestion des\nressources et de contrôle des territoires et des réseaux.\np. 6\n\nLa fonction d’adaptateur\nsocial est cependant principalement une propriété émer-\ngente, qui résulte de processus auto-organisés constitués\nd’interactions entre de multiples acteurs, dans et entre\nles villes. Ces processus activent ensemble tous les do-\nmaines de la vie sociale, même si les interprétations les\nplus fréquentes insistent sur les considérations politiques\nou économiques.\np.6\n\nà l’échelle de la ville, sont bien identifiés des proces-\nsus d’organisation sociale du travail qui améliorent laproductivité, et qui rendent possible une accélération de\nl’innovation grâce à une fréquence accrue des interac-\ntions. Dans la théorie urbaine, nous donnons au terme\n« innovation » un sens très large et abstrait, qui recouvre\nl’ensemble des changements sociaux, technologiques\net culturels, intervenant dans la nature et l’organisation\ndes activités humaines.\np.7 \n\nLes fouilles archéolo-\ngiques ont très souvent mis en évidence dans les villes\nles plus anciennes la présence simultanée du temple, du\npalais et du marché (Weatley, 1971), attestant l’existence\ndès cette époque d’une complexité sociale « à la Veblen »\np. 7\n\nL’organisation urbaine se caractérise par la multiplica-\ntion des rôles sociaux, induisant une division sociale du\ntravail, qui à terme, lorsqu’elle est jointe à des formes\nnon exclusivement prédatrices de l’accumulation, per-\nmet d’augmenter la productivité. Les interprétations\néconomistes de « la » ville mettent ainsi l’accent sur des\néconomies d’échelle ou des économies d’agglomération\nou d’urbanisatio\np. 7\n\nLa mise en réseau des villes\npermet d’échapper aux limitations des ressources locales\net dans le même temps oblige par émulation à continuer\nl’innovation, dans la rivalité et la concurrence avec les\nautres villes. Par les échanges d’information qui s’opèrent\nentre les villes connectées en réseau, l’innovation circule\net devient motrice du développement urbain auquel elle\ns’identifie. En ce sens, les villes en systèmes remplissent\nla fonction d’adaptateur des territoires au changement\nsocial, technologique, économique ou culturel, qu’elles\nalimentent en permanence par les innovations qui se\ndéveloppent dans leurs réseaux (Figures 1 et 2).\n\n\nCette fonction d’adaptateur social historique est reconnue\nimplicitement par le fait que nous continuons d’employer\nle même mot, la ville, pour identifier des formes d’habitat\nplurimillénaires, et pour désigner des concentrations qui\nvont de quelques milliers à plusieurs dizaines de millions\nd’habitants – ces mégapoles procédant toutes d’entités\nurbaines antérieures bien moins grandes\n\n\nLa résilience des\nréseaux urbains est en effet très grande : les historiens du\nMoyen-Âge ont établi que, un siècle après la catastrophe de\nla Grande Peste qui a divisé par deux l’effectif de la popu-\nlation en Europe, non seulement les villes avaient retrouvé\nleur population antérieure, mais aussi dans leur ensemble\nle rang qu’elles occupaient dans la hiérarchie urbaine euro-\npéenne un siècle auparavant. Dès cette époque, les relations\nentre les villes étaient suffisamment nombreuses et suivies\npour que le redressement de chacune s’opère en synergie\navec celui des autres, la perturbation externe représentée\npar la catastrophe a perturbé la trajectoire de chaque ville\nsans modifier sensiblement l’organisation propre du sys-\ntème des villes, issue de sa dynamique concurrentielle.\n\n\ns’explique en fait par une co-évolution des villes extrê-\nmement proactive, par un processus concurrentiel fait\nd’imitation et d’anticipation pour la valorisation des\nrichesses localisées, dans lequel tous les acteurs urbains\nsont très généralement engagés.\n\n\ncompte des interactions entre les villes (Favaro, 2007  \nFavaro & Pumain, 2011), selon des cycles de diffusion\nhiérarchique des innovations, qui induisent une crois-\nsance des inégalités de taille entre les villes légèrement\nplus forte que celle prévue par ce modèle stochastique\n– ce qui est plus conforme aux observation\n\n\nAu cours du temps, ce que j’ai appelé une « croissance\ndistribuée », multiplicative, est ainsi répartie entre toutes\nles villes, qui dans un système très connecté se dévelop-\npent à peu près au même rythme, grâce au captage ou à\nl’adoption des innovations du moment, lesquelles sont\nvéhiculées par les multiples réseaux connectant les villes\nentre elles. Les innovations sont en général captées ou\nimpulsées dans un premier temps par les plus grandes\nvilles, qui possèdent par accumulation antérieure une di-\nversité d’activités et une complexité sociale favorisant la\nprobabilité d’émergence des innovations ou augmentant\nles capacités de l’adopter. Les activités innovantes sont\namenées à sélectionner ces localisations, bien qu’elles\nsoient en général plus coûteuses (en loyers, en rémuné-\nrations) parce qu’elles y trouvent les moyens (financiers,\nintellectuels) de se développer dans la période à hauts\nrisques où leur utilité sociale est incertaine. Leur succès éventuel engendre des profits élevés et donc une proba-\nbilité de croissance supérieure pour les grandes villes,\nbien que les coûts élevés associés et l’imitation par les\nautres villes entraîne assez vite une propagation, une\n« délocalisation » vers des villes plus petites et moins\ncoûteuses – assurant celles-ci de participer à la croissance\net à la modernisation de leurs structures, sans toutefois en\nretirer tout à fait autant de bénéfices. \n\n\nCelle-ci met en\navant la plus forte capacité des grandes villes à capter les\nbénéfices de l’innovation, qui sont plus importants dans\nles premiers stades, mais avec des coûts supérieurs, si\nbien qu’un processus de diffusion s’opère vers des villes\nde moins grande taille, où les coûts sont plus modestes,\nlorsque le produit ou le service ne rapporte plus autant\ncar sa production se banalise. Lorsque l’activité devient\nobsolète, elle n’est plus assurée que par des petites villes\nspécialisées. \n\nd’échelles supérieures : les états, mais aussi les\nréseaux bancaires ou commerciaux, puis les entreprises\nindustrielles et multinationales. Paradoxalement, ces\nconquêtes réalisées grâce aux villes leur ont faire perdre\nune grande partie du contrôle local qu’elles exerçaient\nsur leur évolution. L\n\n\nertes, les acteurs présents dans les villes sont\ntoujours en concurrence avec ceux des autres villes pour\nvaloriser l’investissement local, la richesse accumulée,\net capter les innovations. Mais les villes ont perdu\nl’exercice de nombreux pouvoirs (édicter des normes\npour les citoyens locaux, règlementer l’activité éco-\nnomique) qui ont été délégués à des acteurs contrôlant\nles territoires à des niveaux d’échelle supérieurs, états-\nnations ou entreprises en réseaux. \n\n\nCar il se trouve que les\nressorts les plus influents de la dynamique du système\ndes villes, c’est-à-dire la concurrence entre les villes et\nl’expansion historique des relations systémiques, sont\nplus que jamais activés par la mondialisation. Celle-\nci met en communication,\n\n\nLes réseaux des entreprises multinationales les moyens techniques de télécom-\nmunication tout comme les organisations politiques ou\nassociatives internationales et régionales participent de\ncette évolution. La force de ces logiques explique la\ndifficulté des tentatives de reprise de contrôle local pour\nen corriger les effets.\n\n\nCréer les condi-\ntions locales de qualité de vie et d’ambiance urbaines\nfavorables à l’attraction d’investissements, sans sacrifier\nl’adaptabilité de la ville aux innovations de l’avenir, re-\nquiert à la fois une bonne connaissance des circulations\ndans les réseaux mondiaux et une savante animation des\nsynergies locales\n\n\nEn d’autres termes, les\nsystèmes des villes sont des systèmes complexes, dif-\nficile à contrôler : les villes et les états pourront-ils en\ninfléchir la trajectoire ?\n\n\n";"D Pumain,"

"Modelling the emergence of spatial patterns of economic activity";"7713334374848079873";"2012";"This paper describes a simulation model of the spatial development of economic activities over time. The key principle addressed is how spatial patterns of economic activity emerge from decisions of individual firms, which are in turn influenced by the existing spatial configuration. A stylized simulation is presented, in which two types of firms grow at different rates, giving rise to split offs and spatial relocations. The influence of the spatial pattern on individual firms' decisions is implemented in various ways, related to well-known effects such as Jacobs and Marshall externalities described in the economic literature and congestion effects. We demonstrate that different assumptions about the spatial scale of these externalities lead to different spatial configurations. Function concentration (Marshall effects) is more likely to lead to the emergence of subcentres with a specific specialisation. However, the spatial scale of the market and agglomeration effects matters. In particular, if Marshall advantages stretch out over a longer distance, more subcentres emerge. Somewhat surprisingly, congestion seems to have a minor impact on the emerging patterns. The simulation outcomes are intuitively plausible, suggesting that micro-simulation is a promising tool for developing forecasting models to support spatial and economic policies. However, they also articulate the need for validation of the behavioural decision rules, in particular by investigating how growth rates and the spatial scale of externalities differs between different industrial sectors.";"Jung Hun Yang,Dick Ettema,"
"Did Zipf anticipate socio-economic spatial networks?";"8322772952162319808";"2012";"An avalanche of empirical studies has addressed the validity of the rank-size rule (or Zipf’s law) in a multi-city context in many countries. City size in most countries seems to obey Zipf’s law, but the question under which conditions (e.g. sample size, spatial scale) this ‘law’ holds remained largely underinvestigated. Another complementary question is whether socio-economic networks in space also show a similar hierarchical pattern.  Against this background, the present paper investigates – from a methodological viewpoint – the relationship between network connectivity and the rank-size rule (or Zipf’s law) in an urban-economic network constellation. After a review of the literature, we address in particular the following methodological issues: (i) the (aggregate) behavioral foundation underlying the rank-size rule/Zipf’s law in the light of spatial-economic network theories (e.g. entropy maximization, spatial interaction theory, etc.)  (ii) the nature of the analytical relationship between social-spatial network analysis and the rank-size rule/Zipf’s law. We argue that the rank size rule is compatible with conventional economic foundations of spatial network models. Consequently, a spatial-economic interpretation – as well as a network connectivity interpretation – of the rank-size rule coefficient is provided.  Our methodological contribution forms the foundation for the subsequent empirical analysis applied to spatial networks in a socio-economic context. The aim here is to test the sensitivity of empirical findings for changes in scale, functional forms, time periods, and network structures. Our application is concerned with an extensive spatio-temporal panel database related to the evolution of urban population in Germany. We test the relevance of the rank-size rule/Zipf’s law, and its evolution over the years, and – in parallel – the related ‘socio-economic’ connectivity in these urban networks. In particular, we will show that Zipf’s law (i.e., with the rank-size coefficient equal to 1) is only valid under particular conditions of the sample size. The paper concludes with some retrospective and prospective remarks.";"Aura Reggiani,Peter Nijkamp,"
"Urban geosimulation";"5332568520899663060";"2012";"The field of geosimulation represents one of the most innovative attempts to revitalize the usefulness and application of spatial modeling. With its generative emphasis on micro-dynamics of complex systems and its flexible treatment of space, time, pattern, and process, it marks a significant departure from traditionally employed coarse, static approaches. The primacy of geography in geosimulation also represents a departure for spatial simulation from its reliance on modeling methods borrowed from economics and physics, which were often ported to spatial applications because of tractability, but without consideration of the suitability of the fit. Research in geosimulation, while still nascent in its development, has been particularly active in urban applications, where the technique has considerably expanded the range of questions and ideas that can be explored in simulation. This chapter reviews the origins of urban geosimulation, discusses the state-of-the-art relative to urban applications, and speculates about potential future avenues of inquiry in the field.";"Paul Torrens,"

We argue that we need to make progress on these issues while at the same time extending our models to deal with cross-cutting issues that defi ne societal grand challenges such as climate change, energy depletion, aging, migration, security, and a host of other global issues. We pick up various pointers to how we might best use models in a policy context that have been introduced in many of the applications presented within this book and we argue that in the future, we need to develop a more robust approach to how we might use such models in policy making and planning.";"Alison J J Heppenstall,Andrew T.

" Integration of agent-based and cellular automata models for simulating urban sprawl";"12340198797557898426";"2004";"Simulations using the CA technique in geo-spatial modelling have been attempted in the recent times. However it is seen that CA models do not address the external driving factors that are also responsible for the dynamics involved directly. In order to confront the limitation of the CA models not interact- ing with the externalities driving the process, the integration of agent-based models over a CA model is more appropriate. Hence, the current research is aimed at the development of framework for inte- gration of CA and agent-based models for simulations. For enabling the efficient integration of the CA models and agent-based models at appropriate scales in space and time, the research outlines the framework for undertaking such simulations. This is suggested using the proposed Geo-Spatial Ana- lyser for space variant simulations and incorporating the HLA framework for time variant simulations. The urban sprawl dynamics is considered for demonstrating the prototype of an agent-based model exhibiting radial urban sprawl. This reveals the pattern of growth that takes place under different sce- narios. For the application of agent-based and cellular automata models for a real situation, the case of Mangalore city, Karnataka, India is considered and applied. The Mangalore city is currently experi- encing high rates of urbanisation as evinced from the study. For a scenario of an infrastructure initia- tive like the creation of a ring road, the implications of this are depicted using the combination of agent-based and CA models. The simulations reveal the nature of likely growth in the region due to infrastructure initiative. This work has contributed in the development of the framework for integra- tion of agent-based models and the CA models for undertaking geo-spatial simulations. The case of urban sprawl dynamics was considered and demonstrated using the combination of agents-based models with the CA model for visualising the patterns of growth in conjunction with the drivers of sprawl.";"H S Sudhira,"
" A modular modelling framework for hypotheses testing in the simulation of urbanisation";"15591873270705667361";"2015";"In this paper, we present a modelling experiment developed to study systems of cities and processes of urbanisation in large territories over long time spans. Building on geographical theories of urban evolution, we rely on agent-based models to 1) formalise complementary and alternative hypotheses of urbanisation and 2) explore their ability to simulate observed patterns in a virtual laboratory. The paper is therefore divided into two sections : an overview of the mechanisms implemented to represent competing hypotheses used to simulate urban evolution  and an evaluation of the resulting model structures in their ability to simulate—efficiently and parsimoniously—a system of cities (between 1000 and 2000 cities in the Former Soviet Union) over several periods of time (before and after the crash of the USSR). We do so using a modular framework of model-building and evolutionary algorithms for the calibration of several model structures. This project aims at tackling equifinality in systems dynamics by confronting different mechanisms with similar evaluation criteria. It enables the identification of the best-performing models with respect to the chosen criteria by scanning automatically the parameter space along with the space of model structures (the different combinations of mechanisms).";"Paul Chapron,Sébastien Rey-Coyrehourcq,Clémentine Cottineau,Denise Pumain,Romain Reuillon,"
"A small world perspective on urban systems";"8006614535922635044";"2009";"The theory of small world network as initiated by Watts and Strogatz 1998 has drawn new insights on spatial analysis as well as to systems theory. Its concepts and methods are particularly relevant to geography where spatial interaction is mainstream, and where interactions can be described and studied using large volume of exchanges or similarity matrices. Networks indeed organize through direct links or by indirect paths, inducing topological proximities simultaneously involving spatial, social, cultural or organizational dimensions. Network synergies build over similarities and are fed by complementarities between or inside cities, the two effects potentially amplifying each other according to the “preferential attachment” hypothesis that has been explored in a number of different scientific fields (Barabàsi & Albert, 1999  Barabàsi, 2002  Newmann et al., 2006). In fact, according to Barabási & Albert (1999), the high level of hierarchy observed in “scale-free networks” results from “preferential attachment” which characterizes the development of networks: new connections appear preferentially close nodes already having the largest number of connections. In this way, the improvement in the network accessibility of the new connection will probably be greater. But at the same time, network regions gathering dense and numerous weak links (Granovetter, 1973, 1985) or network entities acting as bridges between several components (Burt, 2004) offer a higher capacity for urban communities to benefit from opportunities and create future synergies. Several methodologies have been suggested on how such denser and more coherent regions (also called communities or clusters) in term of links can be identified (Watts & Strogatz, 1998  Watts, 1999  Barabasi & Albert, 2000  Barabasi, 2003  Auber et al. 2003, Newmann et al., 2006). These communities not only possess a high level of dependency between their member entities, but also show a low level of “vulnerability” allowing for numerous redundancies (Burt, 2000, 2005). The SPANGEO project 2005-2008 (SPAtial Networks in GEOgraphy), gathering a team of geographers and computer scientists, has conducted empirical studies to survey concepts and measures developed in other related fields such as physics, sociology or communication science. The relevancy and potential interpretation of weighted or non weighted measures on edges and nodes were examined and analyzed at different scales (intra-urban, inter-urban or both). New classification and clustering schemes based on the relative local density of subgraphs were developed. The article describes how these notions and methods bring a contribution on a conceptual level, in terms of measures, delineations, explanatory analysis and visualization of geographical phenomena. It is shown that, in order to deal in a rigorous way with qualitative information, we can try many tricks. In some cases, the large memories and the power of computation of the machine are enough for facing problems with qualitative data, otherwise non treatable  in other cases, this goal is reached by the possibility of “visualization” of information or “cooperative solution” (through communication) allowed by the computer. Moreover, in some cases the qualitative is managed by means of algorithms (carrying out a sequence of “logical” statements)  in other cases the problem is “hardened” (made quantitative), then the output is “relaxed” (reduced to a probabilistic result). Even if the set of methods is rapidly increasing, we look for a taxonomy of the bulk of tools, according to potential use in geography and planning. Considering, for instance, characterization of geographical objects, spatial statistical analysis, territorial modeling and simulation, etc., every qualitative method (e.g. conceptual maps, ontologies, folksonomies, cladistics, qualitative regression, cross impact analysis, expert systems, etc.) is classified, with a short description of its main features. For a better understanding of meaning, procedures and potentialities of qualitative methods, a brief account of four case-studies is given. A software for building “ontology” is used to map a system of interacting agents  “textual statistics” are applied for analyzing the perception of landscape on the basis of an “open answer” (qualitative) survey  the “cross impact analysis” is the qualitative modeling tool built for the evaluation of the consequences of a land-use project  in a qualitative “multi-criteria evaluation” it is grounded the site selection for location of a big infrastructure. As a conclusion, the perspectives of qualitative methods are discussed, in the light of two emerging phenomena: respectively, the incoming “extreme data” availability age  and the next “highly automatic” computer-based research activity epoch.";"Céline Rozenblat,Guy Melanҫon,"

The proposed approach consists in optimizing the distribution of crops in a territory based on a multi-agent optimization approach. A group of agents represents each type of crop. The objective of an agent group is to occupy a total surface of parcels to achieve its objectives of production while reducing the value of risk for the whole watershed. Some agronomic, economic and hydrologic constraints restrict the behavior of agents and must be satisfied during the optimization process. The value of runoff risk is evaluated by a spatial hydrological model at the level of the Digital Terrain Model. Three optimization strategies based on Tabu search are developed and tested using real data. They provide satisfactory solutions in various computation times.";"Thierry Paquet,Wassim Jaziri,"

Urban hierarchy is revealed by means of the Zipf’s law and Gibrat’s model is used to describe the mechanisms of urban growth. Deviations from this model were explained by studying the specific trajectories of five different classes of cities, on various time scales (from 1872 to 2010 and from 1960 to 2010). These deviations highlight different kinds of factors (political, economic, localization of resources and historical accidents) that shaped the Brazilian system during the last century.";"Cosmo Antonio Ignazzi,"
"Evolving optimal spatial allocation policies for complex and uncertain environments";"12107359919532189525";"2014";"© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.Urban green spaces play a crucial role in the creation of healthy environments in densely populated areas. Agent-based systems are commonly used to model processes such as green-space allocation. In some cases, this systems delegate their spatial assignation to optimisation techniques to find optimal solutions. However, the computational time complexity and the uncertainty linked with long-term plans limit their use. In this paper we explore an approach that makes use of a statistical model which emulates the agent-based system’s behaviour based on a limited number of prior simulations to inform a Genetic Algorithm. The approach is tested on a urban growth simulation, in which the overall goal is to find policies that maximise the inhabitants’ satisfaction. We find that the model-driven approximation is effective at leading the evolutionary algorithm towards optimal policies.";"David W. Corne,Marta Vallejo,Verena Rieser,"

"Urban transitions: scaling complex cities down to human size";"10775461139251911303";"2016";"Complexity science has become prominent in studying cities as concepts like smart city and big data indicate. In particular network analysis has allowed to studying various aspects of cities in new ways. As such these analyses are often disconnected and subsequent business models often remain disembedded. However, complexity science can also compare various patterns extending over different scales (scaling) if they belong to the same entity (allometry). Such relationships pertain to cities too suggesting that buildings, infrastructure and traffic amongst other things develop interdependently and, that across specific city systems scaling phenomena can be compared according to cities' population size. The article argues that while many scaling phenomena of physical and social networks can indeed inform urban transition research the proposed central role of cities' population size is highly ambivalent. This is particularly true for economic indicators like GDP, which do not reflect the need for sustainability. Still, network and scaling analysis of the built environment can contribute to transition theory if explanatory social mechanisms relating human behaviours and social institutions to existing scaling phenomena are provided.";"Frank Schiller,"

"Actions, interactions et structure dans l'émergence de la stratification sociale des diplômes: un modèle de choix discrets avec externalités";"5124191580945229014";"2006";"The article presents a generating model of educational stratification which aims analytically decompose the emergence of this one in terms of individual choices, of interactions direct and indirect between them and of structural constraints which weigh on the actors. The model suggested takes as a starting point the framework of discrete choices models with externalities. By this one, it proposes to refine the most usually adopted theorizations in the quantitative studies of the educational stratification, namely the �rational educational choice approach�. The article guides the reader through the stages of construction and study of the model. In the first time, the sociological ideas which melt this model are exposed. In the second time, their mathematical formalization, initially, their computational translation (in an agentsbased system), then, are dissected. In the third time, the results of the deductive treatment by simulation of the theoretical model are elaborate inductively. On the one hand, the simulated data are confronted with French and Italian empirical data to establish the degree of conformity between the theoretical educational stratification and empirical one. In addition, one studies the data produced by the model under experimental conditions different from those adopted to reproduce the empirical data: namely, the role of the interindividual variability in the genesis of the educational stratification is explored. The article is concluded by a discussion about the limits of our formal model.";"G Manzo,"
" The evolutionary origins of hierarchy";"8060972379389888969";"2016";"A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks--their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits--but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.";"Jeff Clune,Joost Huizinga,Jean Baptiste Mouret,Henok Mengistu,"

"Reinterpreting central place networks using ideas from fractals and self-organized criticality";"17871849246124099054";"2006";"The basic rules of central place networks are abstracted and formulated as three geometric series scaling laws, which can be transformed into several power laws associated with fractal structure. The scaling laws might be the Rosetta Stone to understand the complexity of human geographical systems because they take the form of Horton and Strahler’s laws in geomorphology and Gutenberg and Richter’s laws in seismology indicative of fractals and self-organized criticality (SOC). An empirical analysis is conducted with the use of data from southern Germany, given by Christaller. The fractal dimensions, Df , of four systems are calculated as follows: Df is 1.733 for Munich, 1.685 for Nuremberg, 1.837 for Stuttgart, and 1.481 for Frankfurt. SOC theory is employed to interpret the fractality of central places, and the power laws are seen as signatures of feasible optimality, thus yielding further support to the suggestion that optimality of the system as a whole explains the dynamic origin of fractal forms in nature.";"Yanguang Chen,Yixing Zhou,"
"Simulating the Past for Understanding the Present. A Critical Review";"2149957589205424980";"2016";"This introductory essay aims to introduce the chapters in the book presenting some aspects of the theoretical and conceptual framework necessary to consider the advantages computer simulation techniques and technologies offer to historical disciplines, but also quoting from the hundreds of examples in current scientific literature to give a context within which the individual contributions can be understood better. We argue that historical simulations should be much more than vivid illustrations of what scholars believe in the present existed in the past. A simulation is basically the computer representation of a “mechanism”, representing how social intentions, goals and behaviors were causally connected in the past. This can be done by formulating a “generative model”, that is, a model of a set of mechanisms. In this chapter, it is suggested that computer simulation may act as a Virtual Laboratory to help studying how human societies have experimented relevant transformations and in which way the consequences of those transformations in technology, activities, behavior, organization or knowledge were transmitted to other social agents or groups of social agents. Building artificial societies inside a computer allows us to understand that social reality is not capricious. It has been produced somehow, although not always the same cause produces the same effect, because social actions are not performed in isolation, but in complex and dialectical frameworks, which favor, prevent, or modify the capacity, propensity, or tendency the action has to produce or to determine a concrete effect. This way of studying social dynamics in the past by means of computer simulations is beginning to abandon its infancy. Archaeologists and historians have started to convert social theories in computer programs trying to simulate social process and experiment with different explanations about known archaeological societies. Our book is just one additional example of a current trend among archaeologists and historians: historical events occurred only once and many years ago but within a computer surrogates of those events can be artificially repeated here and now for understanding how and why they happened.";"Florencia Del Castillo,Juan A Barceló,"
"An agent-based model as a tool of planning at a sub-regional scale";"17130467296137712603";"2014";"This paper describes an agent-based model developed to simulate the impact that different planning policies may have in enhancing the attractiveness of the industrial estates located in a network of four municipalities located in the North of Portugal. The policies were simulated using three scenarios that can be distinguished by the municipal level of coordination they are implemented and by the type of action performed. In the model, enterprises are agents looking for a suitable location and the estates attractiveness is based on their level of facilities, amenities, accessibility and in the cost of soil. The coordinated qualification of the industrial estates is the most effective policy to strengthen their attractiveness. It was in this scenario that more industrial estates become attractive and more enterprises relocated. Results also indicate that the promotion of diffused and unqualified industrial estates is an inefficient policy to attract enterprises. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.";"Fernando Pereira Da Fonseca,Antônio Nélson Rodrigues Da Silva,Rui A R Ramos,"
" Methods for multilevel analysis and visualisation of geographical networks";"12605562452359447371";"2013";"This leading-edge study focuses on the latest techniques in analysing and representing the complex, multi-layered data now available to geographers studying urban zones and their populations. The volume tracks the successful results of the SPANGEO Project, which was set up in 2005 to standardize, and share, the syncretic, multinational mapping techniques already developed by geographers and computer scientists. SPANGEO sought new and responsive ways of visualising urban geographical and social data that reflected the fine-grained detail of the inputs. It allowed for visual representation of the large and complex networks and flows which are such an integral feature of the dynamism of urban geography. SPANGEO developed through the ‘visual analytics loop’ in which geographers collaborated with computer scientists by feeding data into the design of visualisations that in turn spawned the urge to incorporate more varied data into the visualisation. This volume covers all the relevant aspects, from conceptual principles to the tools of network analysis and the actual results flowing from their deployment. Detailed case studies set out in this volume include spatial multi-level analyses of flows in airports and sea ports, as well as the fascinating scientific networks in European cities. The volume shows how the primary concern of geography—the interaction of society with physical space—has been revivified by the complexities of new cartographical and statistical methodologies, which allow for highly detailed mapping and far more powerful computer analysis of spatial relationships.";"Guy Melancon,Céline Rozenblat,"
"Urban settlement transitions";"17081766079438925720";"2002";"Urban growth dynamics attracts the efforts of scientists from many different disciplines with objectives ranging from theoretical understanding to the development of carefully tuned realistic models that can serve as planning and policy tools. Theoretical models are often abstract and of limited applied value while most applied models yield little theoretical understanding. Here we present a mathematically well-defined model based on a modified Markov random field with lattice-wide interactions that produces realistic growth patterns as well as behavior observed in a range of other models based on diffusion-limited aggregation, cellular automata, and similar models. We investigate the framework's ability to generate plausible patterns using minimal assumptions about the interaction parameters since the tuning and specific definition of these are outside of the scope of this paper. Typical universality classes of the simulated dynamics and the phase transitions between them are discussed in the context of real urban dynamics. Using suitability data derived from topography, we produce configurations quantitatively similar to real cities. Also, an intuitive class of interaction rules is found to produce fractal configurations, not unlike vascular systems, that resemble urban sprawl. The dynamics are driven by interactions, depicting human decisions, between all lattice points. This is realized in a computationally efficient way using a mean-field renormalization (area average) approach. The model provides a mathematically transparent framework to which any level of detail necessary for actual urban planning application can be added.";"Claes Andersson,Roger White,Steen Rasmussen,"
" The political economy of city branding";"14794110600853775730";"2014";"© 2014 Ari-Veikko Anttiroiko. Globalization affects urban communities in many ways. One of its manifestations is increased intercity competition, which compels cities to increase their attractiveness in terms of capital, entrepreneurship, information, expertise and consumption. This competition takes place in an asymmetric field, with cities trying to find the best possible ways of using their natural and created assets, the latter including a naturally evolving reputation or consciously developed competitive identity or brand. The Political Economy of City Branding discusses this phenomenon from the perspective of numerous post-industrial cities in North America, Europe, East Asia and Australasia. Special attention is given to local economic development policy and industrial profiling, and global city rankings are used to provide empirical evidence for cities’ characteristics and positions in the global urban hierarchy. On top of this, social and urban challenges such as creative class struggle are also discussed. The core message of the book is that cities should apply the tools of city branding in their industrial promotion and specialization, but at the same time take into account the special nature of their urban communities and be open and inclusive in their brand policies in order to ensure optimal results This book will be of interest to scholars and practitioners working in the areas of local economic development, urban planning, public management, and branding.";"A.-V.

"Urban systems dynamics, urban growth and scaling laws: The question of ergodicity";"10047041702253183342";"2012";"Scaling laws, when applied to geographical entities, reveal the configuration of the dynamic processes that generate inequalities in dimension. Two interpretations of their application to city systems are discussed here. According to physicists, the exponent value of power laws could differentiate the urban activities that are liable to achieve scale economies, i.e. those with exponent values smaller than one, from those that are merely proportional to the population because they meet universal needs, while others, with exponents greater than one, are seen as being accompanied by increasingly rapid growth and the risk of crises. This cross-sectional interpretation in terms of the longitudinal trajectory of an individual city assumes that the city system is ergodic. Yet this hypothesis is not consistent with an evolutionary theory of urban systems integrating the spatial distribution of labour and the hierarchical diffusion of innovation.";"Denise Pumain,"

"Cities as nuclei of sustainability?";"13980200677077132725";"2014";"Analyzing CO$_2$ emission inventories of 256 cities from 33 countries we find power-law correlations between the emissions and city size, measured in population. The results suggest that in developing countries, large cities emit more CO$_2$ per capita compared to small cities, i.e.\ they tend to exhibit super-linear correlations, where doubling the population of any city typically implies up to a $115$\% increase of emissions. The results suggest the opposite for developed countries, i.e.\ linear or sub-linear correlations. This implies better efficiency of large cities, where doubling the population of any city typically implies only an $80$\% increase of emissions. The transition occurs at approximately $10,000$\,\$ GDP(PPP)/cap. We derive how the total emissions of an entire country relate with the power-law correlations and find that in any case the size of the country is most important. The size of the most populated city dominates in the case of super-linear correlations. From the climate change mitigation point of view we conclude that urbanization is desirable in developed countries and should be accompanied by efficiency-increasing mechanisms in developing countries. More data acquisition is needed to support our empirical findings.";"Diego Rybski,Jürgen P. Kropp,Dominik E. Reusser,Christina Fichtner,Till Sterzel,Anna-Lena Winz,"

" Urban growth prediction: a review of computational models and human perceptions";"14812892332104096387";"2012";"Human population continues to aggregate in urban centers. This inevitably increases the urban footprint with significant consequences for biodiversity, climate, and environmental resources. Urban growth prediction models have been extensively studied with the overarching goal to assist in sustainable management of urban centers. Despite the extensive body of research, these models are not frequently included in the decision making process. This review aims on bringing this gap by analyzing results from a survey investigating developer and user perceptions from the modeling and planning communities, respectively. An overview of existing models, including advantages and limitations, is also provided. A total of 156 manuscripts is identified. Analysis of aggregated statistics indicates that cellular automata are the prevailing modeling technique, present in the majority of published works. There is also a strong preference for local or regional studies, a choice possibly related to data availability. The survey found a strong recognition of the models’ potential in decision making, but also limited agreement that these models actually reach that potential in practice. Collaboration between planning and modeling communities is deemed essential for transitioning models into practice. Data availability is considered a stronger restraining factor by respondents with limited algorithmic experience, which may indicate that model input data are becoming more specialized, thus significantly limiting wide-spread applicability. This review assesses developer and user perceptions and critically discusses existing urban growth prediction models, acting as a reference for future model development.

"Hierarchy in cities and city systems";"6670978854631021902";"2006";"Hierarchy is implicit in the very term city. Cities grow from hamlets and villages into small towns and thence into larger forms such as metropolis, megalopolis and world cities which are gigalopolis. In one sense, all urban agglomerations are referred to generically as cities but this sequence of city size from the smallest identifiable urban units to the largest contains an implicit hierarchy in which there are many more smaller cities than larger ones. This organisation approximately scales in a regular but simple manner, city sizes following a rank-size rule whose explanation is both mysterious and obvious. In this chapter, we begin with a simple but well-known model of urban growth where growth is randomly proportionate to city size and where it is increasingly unlikely that a small city becomes very big. It is easy to show that this process generates a hierarchy which is statistically self- similar, hence fractal but this does not contain any economic interactions that we know must be present in the way cities grow and compete. We thus modify the model adding mild diffusion and then note how these ideas can be fashioned using network models which generate outcomes consistent with these kinds of order and scaling. We then turn this argument on its head and describe how the same sorts of morphology can be explained using ideas from central place theory. These notions are intrinsic to the way cities evolve and we conclude by noting how city design must take account of natural hierarchies which grow organically, rather than being established using top-down, centralized planning.";"M Batty,"

The importance of heterogeneity in the specification of ABMs, however, creates new demands for empirical support. An earlier analysis of a survey of residential preferences within southeastern Michigan revealed seven groups of residents with similar preferences on similar characteristics of location. In this paper, we present an ABM that represents the process of residential development within an urban system and run it for a hypothetical pattern of environmental variation. Residential locations are selected by residential agents, who evaluate locations on the basis of preference for nearness to urban services, including jobs, aesthetic quality of the landscape, and their similarity to their neighbors. We populate our ABM with a population of residential preferences drawn from the survey results in five different ways: (1) preferences drawn at random  (2) equal preferences based on the mean from the entire survey sample  (3) preferences drawn from a single distribution, whose mean and standard deviation are derived from the survey sample  (4) equal preferences within each of seven groups, based on the group means  and (5) preferences drawn from distributions for each of seven groups, defined by group means and standard deviations. Model sensitivity analysis, based on multiple runs of our model under each case, revealed that adding heterogeneity to agents has a significant effect on model outcomes, measured by aggregate patterns of development sprawl and clustering.";"Daniel G.

" Beyond corroboration: strengthening model validation by looking for unexpected patterns";"1699663051565167789";"2015";"Models of emergent phenomena are designed to provide an explanation to global-scale phenomena from local-scale processes. Model validation is commonly done by verifying that the model is able to reproduce the patterns to be explained. We argue that robust validation must not only be based on corroboration, but also on attempting to falsify the model, i.e. making sure that the model behaves soundly for any reasonable input and parameter values. We propose an open-ended evolutionary method based on Novelty Search to look for the diverse patterns a model can produce. The Pattern Space Exploration method was tested on a model of collective motion and compared to three common a priori sampling experiment designs. The method successfully discovered all known qualitatively different kinds of collective motion, and performed much better than the a priori sampling methods. The method was then applied to a case study of city system dynamics to explore the model's predicted values of city hierarchisation and population growth. This case study showed that the method can provide insights on potential predictive scenarios as well as falsifiers of the model when the simulated dynamics are highly unrealistic.";"Guillaume Chérel,Clémentine Cottineau,Romain Reuillon,"
" Extracting tag hierarchies";"875032925677808855";"2013";"Tagging items with descriptive annotations or keywords is a very natural way to compress and highlight information about the properties of the given entity. Over the years several methods have been proposed for extracting a hierarchy between the tags for systems with a flat, egalitarian organization of the tags, which is very common when the tags correspond to free words given by numerous independent people. Here we present a complete framework for automated tag hierarchy extraction based on tag occurrence statistics. Along with proposing new algorithms, we are also introducing different quality measures enabling the detailed comparison of competing approaches from different aspects. Furthermore, we set up a synthetic, computer generated benchmark providing a versatile tool for testing, with a couple of tunable parameters capable of generating a wide range of test beds. Beside the computer generated input we also use real data in our studies, including a biological example with a pre-defined hierarchy between the tags. The encouraging similarity between the pre-defined and reconstructed hierarchy, as well as the seemingly meaningful hierarchies obtained for other real systems indicate that tag hierarchy extraction is a very promising direction for further research with a great potential for practical applications. Tags have become very prevalent nowadays in various online platforms ranging from blogs through scientific publications to protein databases. Furthermore, tagging systems dedicated for voluntary tagging of photos, films, books, etc. with free words are also becoming popular. The emerging large collections of tags associated with different objects are often referred to as folksonomies, highlighting their collaborative origin and the flat organization of the tags opposed to traditional hierarchical categorization. Adding a tag hierarchy corresponding to a given folksonomy can very effectively help narrowing or broadening the scope of search. Moreover, recommendation systems could also benefit from a tag hierarchy.";"Tam??s Vicsek,Gergely Tibe??y,P??ter Pollner,Gergely Palla,"

Three current issues are: linking spatial patterns and processes, representing hierarchical relations across scales, and considering nonlinearity to address complex non-stationary settlement dynamics. We present a hierarchical simulation model to investigate complex rural settlement dynamics in Nang Rong, Thailand. This simulation uses sub-models to allocate new villages at three spatial scales. Regional and sub-regional models, which involve a nonlinear space-time autoregressive model implemented in a neural network approach, determine the number of new villages to be established. A dynamic village niche model, establishing pattern-process link, was designed to enable the allocation of villages into specific locations. Spatiotemporal variability in model performance indicates the pattern of village location changes as a settlement frontier advances from rice-growing lowlands to higher elevations.

" Population-Area Relationship for Medieval European Cities";"123627320672301159";"2016";"Medieval European urbanization presents a line of continuity between earlier cities and modern European urban systems. Yet, many of the spatial, political and economic features of medieval European cities were particular to the Middle Ages, and subsequently changed over the Early Modern Period and Industrial Revolution. There is a long tradition of demographic studies estimating the population sizes of medieval European cities, and comparative analyses of these data have shed much light on the long-term evolution of urban systems. However, the next step—to systematically relate the population size of these cities to their spatial and socioeconomic characteristics—has seldom been taken. This raises a series of interesting questions, as both modern and ancient cities have been observed to obey area-population relationships predicted by settlement scaling theory. To address these questions, we analyze a new dataset for the settled area and population of 173 European cities from the early fourteenth century to determine the relationship between population and settled area. To interpret this data, we develop two related models that lead to differing predictions regarding the quantitative form of the population-area relationship, depending on the level of social mixing present in these cities. Our empirical estimates of model parameters show a strong densification of cities with city population size, consistent with patterns in contemporary cities. Although social life in medieval Europe was orchestrated by hierarchical institutions (e.g., guilds, church, municipal organizations), our results show no statistically significant influence of these institutions on agglomeration effects. The similarities between the empirical patterns of settlement relating area to population observed here support the hypothesis that cities throughout history share common principles of organization that self-consistently relate their socioeconomic networks to structured urban spaces.";"Rudolf Cesaretti,Michael E.

"Industrialization and land use change in Mexican border cities: the case of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico";"6242403144830468818";"2001";"Abstract The maquiladora (maquila) economy has brought enormous change to Mexico's northern border region during the last few decades. Scholars have studied many aspects of the region's maquila economy, including bi?national trade, a range of environmental issues, and social and cultural impacts arising from rapid industrialization. Few, however, have examined the relationship between industrialization and the development of urban land. We respond to this deficiency by investigating land use change in Ciudad Juárez, México, during the 1988-1993 period. Two objectives guide the research. First, we document the extent to which the maquila economy has fostered rapid population growth and employment change in Ciudad Juárez and other Mexican border cities. Second, a simple simulation procedure is used to show how growth of the maquila economy has distorted residential and commercial land development in the city. The results indicate that during the 1988-1993 period residential land in the city was ?overdeveloped? while commercial land was ?underdeveloped.? The results offer important clues for understanding the impacts of rapid industrialization, and for guiding urban planning efforts in Mexican border cities.";"Javier Chávez,Brigitte Waldorf,Adrian X Esparza,"
"Springer Complexity";"3143204457106450968";"2013";"Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.";"A.G Fallis,"
"A Century of the Evolution of the Urban System in Brazil";"18400991372826600499";"2013";"In this paper, we study the hitherto unexplored evolution of the size distribution of 185 functionally defined urban areas in Brazil between 1907 and 2008. We apply the traditional power law and the Gabaix–Ibragimov improved estimation method. We find that the power parameter of the size distribution of the 100 largest urban areas increases towards unity, that is, the rank-size rule. Seventeen thousand and twenty cointegration tests of pairwise non-stationary growth paths of cities point to evidence of a common stochastic trend that strengthens throughout the century. Thus, while Zipf's law and Gibrat's law did not formally hold in Brazil's past, these laws are becoming steadily more appropriate descriptions of Brazil's increasingly unequal size distribution of cities.";"Mark J.

It aims to map out the relative disparities in competitive performance among a preselected set of major global cities by offering a hierarchical benchmark analysis of these cities on the basis of a recently completed comparative study on their socio-economic 'power', as exerted and/or perceived by various groups of relevant urban stakeholders. The analytical tool employed to highlight and better understand the relative (hierarchical) position of these cities from a topological perspective is based on Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), which depict in a multidimensional space the similarities among the cities under consideration. The empirical results are presented and interpreted from the perspective of a benchmark ranking of the various cities involved, while finally also an actor-oriented analysis of the distinct performance components of these cities is provided. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";"Daniel Arribas-Bel,Peter Nijkamp,Karima Kourtit,"
"Analogies between urban hierarchies and river networks: Fractals, symmetry, and self-organized criticality";"4427328341773253207";"2009";"A pair of nonlinear programming models is built to explain the fractal structure of systems of cities and those of rivers. The hierarchies of cities can be characterized by a set of exponential functions, which is identical in form to the Horton-Strahler's laws of the river networks. Four power laws can be derived from these exponential functions. The evolution of both systems of cities and rivers are then represented as nonlinear dual programming models: to maximize information entropy subject to a certain energy use or to minimize energy dissipation subject to certain information capacity. The optimal solutions of the programming problems are just the exponential equations associated with scaling relations. By doing so, fractals and the self-organized criticality marked by the power laws are interpreted using the idea from the entropy-maximization principle, which gives further weight to the suggestion that optimality of the system as a whole defines the dynamical origin of fractal forms in both nature and society. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Modelling urban growth patterns: a multiscale perspective";"2802171840008884181";"2003";"Urban development is a complex dynamic process involving various actors with different patterns of behaviour. Modelling urban development patterns is a prerequisite to understanding the process. This paper presents a preliminary multiscale perspective for such modelling based on spatial hierarchical theory and uses it for the analysis of a rapidly developing city. This framework starts with a conceptual model, which aims at linking planning hierarchy, analysis hierarchy, and data hierarchy. Analysis hierarchy is the focus of this paper. It is divided into three scales: probability of change (macro), density of change (meso), and intensity of change (micro). The multiscale analysis seeks to distinguish spatial determinants on each of the three scales, which are able to provide deeper insights into urban growth patterns shaped by spontaneous and self-organised spatial processes. A methodology is also presented to implement the framework, based on exploratory data analysis and spatial logistic regression. The combination of both is proven to have strong capacity of interpretation. This framework is tested by a case study of Wuhan City, China. The scale-dependent and scale-independent determinants are found significantly on two scales.";"J Q Cheng,I Masser,"
"Urban population loss in historical perspective: United States, 1820–2000";"1226887252453554024";"2009";"Employing an historical perspective, the author mounts a quantitative and theoretical assessment of population loss in the large cities of the United States. Three periods are considered: one prior to 1920 when large city population loss was aberrant  a second which captures the severe decline of the decades after World War II, and a third that encompasses the more recent shrinkage of cities. Population loss is measured in terms of prevalence, severity, and persistence and is also analyzed geographically. The author further identifies factors affecting population loss which are common and unique to each period. Although population loss has diminished, a number of cities are locked into trajectories of chronic loss, suggesting that a new phase of urbanization has yet to materialize.";"Robert Beauregard,"

Both schemes use vector geometry as an antidote to the geographically unrealistic regular tessellation cellular automata (CA). The work reported here explores the properties of irregular and dynamic VAs in particular, a subclass of geometry not hitherto covered in detail in a spatial agent modelling context. Three realisations of vector agent geometry change are reported in this paper: the Brownian motion algorithm (through midpoint displacement)  edge displacement  and vertex displacement. Through these manipulators, it is shown that vector agents offer the ability to explicitly control geometric form through the alteration of simple parameters (with the potential for further generalisation and transformation operations). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Models in geography revisited";"18363089109623062456";"2008";"Agent based models (ABMs) have many applications, and illustrate a rapidly developing field of enquiry, spanning both the physical-mathematical and human-social sciences. ABMs are seen as most appropriate in situations where decisions or actions are distributed around particular locations, and in which structure is viewed as emergent from the interaction between individuals. ABMs may be used either as representational devices, to reproduce the patterns observed or desired in the system of interest, or as foundational tools contributing to the development of social or economic theory. The role and status of models and modelling is itself an instantiation of a wider debate concerning representation and explanation. Today, a case can be made that the nature of explanation and the use of scientific interpretation reflect much less definite and exclusive positions and permit more diverse approaches than hitherto. The underlying proposition of this commentary is, therefore, that the time is right for a positive application of ABMs within the discipline of geography, and for a rediscovery and reappraisal of the richness and depth of insight in the model-building enterprise more generally. First, the context for ABM development and application is set with reference to the agency-structure debate. Second, some aspects of the heritage of models in geography is presented, based upon reviews of two benchmark publications bearing that title. Next, some of the most significant characteristics, uses, potentials and limitations of ABMs, are reviewed. Finally, some constructive ways forward are suggested, as informed by theory and method from the interpretative social sciences. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"N. J. Clifford,"

Thesauri in this research are automatically developed in a simulation from sets of randomly or exhaustively generated docu-ments. Each thesaurus is generated by the Thesaurus Generator software from a set of several hundred docu-ments, and thousands of different document sets are used as input to the Thesaurus Generator, producing thousands of thesauri. Thus, thousands of thesauri are generated for each data point in accompanying graphs. The characteristics of this large number of thesauri are studied so that the relationships between thesaurus parameters can be determined. Some rules governing these relationships are suggested, addressing factors such as tree height and width, number of tree roots in thesauri, and number of terms available for the vocabu-lary. How these parameters scale as vocabularies grow is addressed. These results apply to various information systems that contain features with hierarchical relation-ships, including many thesauri and ontologies.";"Robert Losee,"
"Estimating Rapidity of Change in Complex Urban Systems: A Multidimensional, Local‐Scale Approach";"8006672556213932409";"2016";"This study illustrates an exploratory approach based on a Multiway Factor Analysis (MFA) to estimate rapidity of change in complex urban systems, based on “fast” and “slow” variables. The proposed methodology was applied to 18 socioeconomic indicators of long-term (1960–2010) transformations in 115 municipalities of Athens’ metropolitan area (Greece), including demography, land-use/planning, and urban form and functions. Athens was regarded as a dynamic urban area with diversified structures and functions at the local scale, expanding through a self-organized pattern rather than a centralized planning strategy. Athens’ urban system was described using nine supplementary (topographic and territorial) variables and 30 independent indicators assessing the local context in recent times. Exploratory data analysis found an increasing connectedness and redundancy among socioeconomic indicators during the phase of largest urban expansion (1960–1990). Only the rate of population growth was classified as a “fast” variable for all five decades investigated. The overall rapidity of change was higher in 1960–1970, 1980–1990, and 2000–2010, decades that coincided with specific phases of urban expansion driven by migration inflow, second-home suburbanization, and Olympic games, respectively. Rapidity of change was high for functional indicators during all five decades studied, while demography indicators changed more rapidly in the first three decades and land-use/planning indicators in the last two decades. Rapidity of change was highest in peri-urban municipalities with a highly diversified economic structure dominated by industry. Our methodology provides a comprehensive overview of the transformations of a complex urban system, quantifying low-level indicators that are rarely assessed in the mainstream literature on urban studies. These results may contribute to design policies addressing complexity and promoting resilience in expanding metropolitan areas.";"Luca Salvati,Pere Serra,"

" Mediterranean land cover change: modelling and monitoring natural vegetation using GIS and remote sensing";"11202195649679875173";"2005";"Mediterranean areas in Europe are subject to human induced changes. In Mediterranean France, land abandonment is the most widespread change, caused by a variety of reasons among which technological developments and social and economic changes. The land abandonment process had several unfavourable consequences for biodiversity, soil erosion and fire risks. To formalize our knowledge of the land abandonment process and to analyze, understand and predict the land abandonment process and its consequences, land cover change models are valuable tools. Validation of such models is essential. In many semi-natural areas the only source of continuous spatial and temporal validation data are various types of remote sensing data. Therefore, this research aims at developing a land cover change model of semi-natural Mediterranean vegetation communities that integrates with remote sensing observations for validation purposes. Therefore I first focus on the optimization of the detection of Mediterranean vegetation communities by remote sensing in time and in space using more traditional image analysis methods and using newly developed innovative information extraction approaches. Second, I constrain the land cover change model to the level of detail that can be obtained from the remote sensing data. A Mediterranean ecosystem in the Peyne area, approximately 60 km west of Montpellier in France, is selected as study site. For the study site an extensive remote sensing dataset is available. To determine and describe changes in vegetation communities in time I carried out a GIS based change detection study using a time series of 8 aerial photograph mosaics from 1946 to 2000. I followed three different approaches to optimise the detection of Mediterranean vegetation communities by remote sensing. In the first approach I have set up an experiment to evaluate the predictive power of 7 statistical techniques including innovative techniques like classification trees, random forests and support vector machines, to find the most important predictive factors and to define the extra value Hyper-spectral HyMap data over multi-spectral ASTER and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. In the second approach I included the spatial domain to analyze and classify remote sensing imagery. This approach not only uses the per-pixel spectral information but also the spectral information of neighbouring pixels. I used a contextual technique named SPARK (SPAtial Reclassification Kernel). The third approach was based on the incorporation of ancillary data or knowledge data into the classification process. I integrated spectral information, ancillary information and contextual information in a spatio-temporal image classification model: the Ancillary Data Classification Model (ADCM). Finally, I used the classification model as a basis for the land cover change prediction model. I limited the model to classes that I could detect with HyMap imagery. I calculated different scenarios to test the hypotheses formulated in the change detection study in space and time. The land cover change model proved to be a valuable tool to test hypotheses in space and time: the spatial interpretation of the model results pointed out which factors were important. I concluded that wetness index, solar radiation, lithology, effects of fire, and effects of grazing are key factors that explain land cover change of semi-natural Mediterranean vegetation communities.";"R.

" Geospatial narratives and their spatio-temporal dynamics: Commonsense reasoning for high-level analyses in geographic information systems";"11422404683820390054";"2014";"The modeling, analysis and visualization of dynamic geospatial phenomena has been identified as a key developmental challenge for next-generation Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this context, the envisaged paradigmatic extensions to contemporary foundational GIS technology raises fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational and (analytical) computational methods that would underlie their spatial information theoretic underpinnings. We present the conceptual overview and architecture for the development of high-level semantic and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic geospatial domains. Building on formal methods in the areas of commonsense reasoning, qualitative reasoning, spatial and temporal representation and reasoning, reasoning about actions and change and computational models of narrative, we identify concrete theoretical and practical challenges that accrue in the context of formal reasoning about space, events, actions and change. With this as a basis and within the backdrop of an illustrated scenario involving the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban narratives, we address specific problems and solution techniques chiefly involving qualitative abstraction, data integration and spatial consistency and practical geospatial abduction.";"Mehul Bhatt,Jan Oliver Wallgrun,"
"A cellular automata model for urban land-use simulation";"487139779145174998";"2005";"This paper presents an urban land-use simulation model using cellular automata (CA). In the model urban growth is regarded as the result of a global process underpinned by local actions and land-use change as the joint action of three different effects: attribute, heterogeneity, and gravity. The attribute and heterogeneity effects are regarded as different aspects of a local driving force for change constituted by changing accessibility and other attributes resulting from the interaction of land use and transport at the neighborhood level. The gravity effect is a universal resistance to change as a result of inertia and agglomeration of compatible land uses in the vicinity. To ensure that local actions would lead to global behavior, a multipass, in addition to a single-pass, land-use-allocation algorithm is designed to mimic land-use changes. With metropolitan Melbourne in Australia as a case study, the performance of the model in replicating land-use changes is compared with that of an alternative model developed by using only a distance function. The results of the comparison show that the proposed CA model outperforms the alternative model with only a distance function, confirming the importance of incorporating local attributes in modeling land-use changes.";"K H Lau,B H Kam,"
"Spatial fluctuations as signatures of self-organization: a complex systems approach to landscape dynamics in Rondônia, Brazil";"4810527467325424349";"2005";"Self-organization is a prominent theme of complexity studies that has been applied in studies of urban evolution and land-cover change. Little work has investigated the potential of self-organization to describe and explain landscape dynamics in frontier settings. The principal aims of this paper are: (a) to present a general theoretical framework of landscape dynamics for a frontier setting in Rondonia, Brazil based on a specific theory of self-organization known as self-organized criticality (SOC), (b) to describe the settlement pattern of a recently settled landscape by focusing on spatial fluctuations of landscape metrics as signatures, and (c) to discuss how plausible mechanisms with clear links to SOC may be considered by investigators of landscape evolution. A general SOC framework is situated within prevailing frameworks that feature proximate and distant drivers of land-cover change. Fourier techniques are used to assess spatial fluctuations of pattern metrics in multiple directions as landscape signatures. Periodicity and 1/f signatures consistent with SOC are simultaneously present dependent on directional orientation. Settings where SOC may serve as an important yet ultimately partial framework for pattern-oriented description and process-oriented explanation are discussed.";"Thomas W. Crawford,"
"The new demographic growth of cities: the case of reurbanisation in Switzerland";"12658112777084420057";"2012";"After having lost population for some decades, many cities are experiencing a new growth. This paper addresses this reurbanisation phenomenon in the case of Switzerland. It argues that the demographic evolution of cities is not adequately explained by the ‘stages of urban development’ model that tends to consider urban regions as closed systems. It should rather be analysed by unfolding the underlying mechanisms that include housing consumption as well as in- and out-migration flows. Swiss cities have gained inhabitants since 2000 thanks to international migrants, young adults, non-family households and some parts of the middle to upper class. From a demographic point of view, families’ residential behaviour remains the driving force of suburbanisation so that the population growth is still higher in suburbs than in cities.

"Why is economic geography not an evolutionary science? Towards an evolutionary economic geography";"16875221460792119298";"2006";"We propose a framework that specifies the process of economic development as an evolutionary branching process of product innovations. Each product innovation provides a growth opportunity for an existing firm or a new firm, and for an existing city or a new city. One can then obtain both firm size and city size distributions as two aggregates resulting from a single evolutionary process. Gains from variety at the firm level (economies of scope) and the urban level (Jacobs externalities) provide the central feedback mechanism in economic development generating strong path dependencies in the spatial concentration of industries and the specialization of cities. Gains from size are also expected, yet these are ultimately bounded by increasing wages. The contribution of our framework lies in providing a micro-foundation of economic geography in terms of the interplay between industrial dynamics and urban growth. The framework is sufficiently general to investigate systematically a number of stylized facts in economic geography, while at the same time it is sufficiently flexible to be extended such as to become applicable in more specific micro-contexts. A number of extensions related to the concepts of knowledge spillover and lock-in, are also discussed.";"Koen Frenken,Ron A. Boschma,"

Le fait que la ville compte parallèlement près de 2 000 ménages supplémentaires nous amène à rejeter les hypothèses relatives à la destruction de logements, à la reconversion d’appartements vers d’autres affectations, ou à une attractivité déficiente (dont témoignerait un taux de vacance substantiel). L’apparente contradiction entre une diminution de la population et une augmentation du nombre de ménages s’explique par la réduction de la taille moyenne de ces derniers.

The preferences of households and firms for a certain location generally depend on the presence of other households or firms at the same location. In this paper, we propose and illustrate a multi-agent model that takes such agglomeration effects into account. In the model, the households or firms that are potentially interested in a candidate site for (redevelopment are individually represented as agents that can indicate their interest by making a bid. In compiling a proposal based on bids of individual agents, the model takes positive and negative synergies between agents into account. Planners and developers are also represented in the model as agents playing specific roles in the process. Simulations in the area of retailing demonstrate the model and show that agglomeration effects have an impact on generated proposals. It is argued that the model can be used as a location-decision component in dynamic multi-agent, land-use systems for simulation or planning support.";"Theo A Arentze,Harry J P Timmermans,"

This paper presents a novel method to model urban land-use change using support-vector machines (SVMs), a new generation of machine learning algorithms used in classification and regression domains. An SVM modeling framework has been developed to analyze land-use change in relation to various factors such as population, distance to roads and facilities, and surrounding land use. As land-use data are generally unbalanced, in the sense that the unchanged data overwhelm the changed data, traditional methods are incapable of classifying relatively minor land-use changes with high accuracy. To circumvent this problem, an unbalanced SVM has been adopted by enhancing the standard SVMs. A case study of Calgary land-use change demonstrates that the unbalanced SVMs can achieve high and reliable performance for land-use-change modeling.";"Chenglin Xie,Bo Huang,Richard Tay,Bo Wu,"

We first explain the concept of a generic evolutionary urban unit (city) and its necessary adaptations to the information provided by each national statistical system. Second, the hierarchical structure and the urban growth process are compared at macro-scale for the seven countries with reference to Zipf's and Gibrat's model: in agreement with an evolutionary theory of urban systems, large similarities shape the hierarchical structure and growth processes in BRICS countries as well as in Europe and United States, despite their positions at different stages in the urban transition that explain some structural peculiarities. Third, the individual trajectories of some 10,000 cities are mapped at micro-scale following a cluster analysis of their evolution over the last fifty years. A few common principles extracted from the evolutionary theory of urban systems can explain the diversity of these trajectories, including a specific pattern in their geographical repartition in the Chinese case. We conclude that the observations at macro-level when summarized as stylised facts can help in designing simulation models of urban systems whereas the urban trajectories identified at micro-level are consistent enough for constituting the basis of plausible future population projections.";"Antonio Ignazzi,Céline Vacchiani-Marcuzzo,François Delisle,Liliane Lizzi,Solène Baffi,Denise Pumain,Elfie Swerts,Clémentine Cottineau,Anne Bretagnolle,Robin Cura,"

The following chapters describe the application carried out to the Rome urban system: chapter 4 presents the way in which the urban system was represented  chapter 5 describes the design of the model, that is the learning mechanisms adopted in the case study  chapter 6 shows the results, which correspond to what the model discovered about the transformation factors working in the study area.";"A Rabino,Antonio Colonna,V DiStephano,Silvana Lombardo,Lorenzo Papini,"

The road growing dynamics consist of two steps: Identifying the maximum transportation potential bewteen two locations within the city, followed by the generation of the least expensive road between these two locations. The simulation defines a previously missing component for modeling the co-evolution of urban settlement-and road systems as it can directly be coupled to existing urban settlement simulations.";"Daniel Yamins,David Fogel,Steen Rasmussen,"
"Complex landscapes of spatial interaction";"14899094039359228098";"2001";"How complex is the spatial economy? Some apostles of complexity argue that complex behaviour can arise in any system consisting of a largish number of intelligent, adaptive agents interacting on the basis of local information only. This paper examines several features of such dynamic systems, including path-dependence, emergence and self-organization. It goes on to explore their importance for the spatial sciences. Because space scales can change abruptly from local to global, strongly-interactive spatial economies sometimes exhibit astonishing collective properties, emergent features which are lawful in their own right. Segregation, self-similarity and the rank-size rule are familiar examples. To understand how collective order arises from seemingly random fluctuations, we must note how agents choose to interact with other agents and with their environment. We must synthesize rather than analyse. In the paper, self-organization is explored in a variety of contexts, including Schelling's model of neighborhood segregation and some work with cellular automata that has sharpened our insights into the collective synthesis of agents' interactions. Power laws are widely observed. A new way of doing social science - agent-based simulation - offers powerful new insights. It seems likely to revolutionize our field, along with the whole of the social sciences. Some of the current research underway in this area is discussed.   Truth is much too complicated to allow anything but approximations. John von Neumann";"David F. Batten,"

We detail a framework that takes advantage of the formalism of automata theory and GI Science to unite cellular automata and multi-agent systems techniques, and provides a spatial approach to bottom-up modeling of complex geographic systems that are comprised of infrastructure and human objects. The suitability of the framework is also discussed with reference to existing cellular automata and multi-agent systems models used in urban studies. Practical implementation of the framework is illustrated with reference to an object-based urban simulation environment and implementation of a popular socio-spatial segregation model.";"Itzhak Benenson,Paul M.

"Hierarchical networks of scientific journals";"1275288670375175716";"2015";"Scientific journals are the repositories of the gradually accumulating knowledge of mankind about the world surrounding us. Just as our knowledge is organised into classes ranging from major disciplines, subjects and fields to increasingly specific topics, journals can also be categorised into groups using various metrics. In addition to the set of topics characteristic for a journal, they can also be ranked regarding their relevance from the point of overall influence. One widespread measure is impact factor, but in the present paper we intend to reconstruct a much more detailed description by studying the hierarchical relations between the journals based on citation data. We use a measure related to the notion of m-reaching centrality and find a network which shows the level of influence of a journal from the point of the direction and efficiency with which information spreads through the network. We can also obtain an alternative network using a suitably modified nested hierarchy extraction method applied to the same data. The results are weakly methodology-dependent and reveal non-trivial relations among journals. The two alternative hierarchies show large similarity with some striking differences, providing together a complex picture of the intricate relations between scientific journals.";"Tamás Vicsek,Enys Mones,Péter Pollner,Gergely Tibély,Gergely Palla,"
"Multi-agent systems for simulating spatial decision behaviors and land-use dynamics";"1889911859184626540";"2006";"A new method to simulate urban land-use dynamics is proposed based on multi-agent systems (MAS). The model consists of a series of environmental layers and multi-agent layers, which can interact with each other. It attempts to explore the interactions between different players or agents, such as residents, property developers, and governments, and between these players and the environment. These interactions can give rise to urban macro-spatial patterns. This model is used to simulate the land-use dynamics of the Haizhu district of Guangzhou City in 1995–2004. Cellular automata (CA) were also used for the simulation of land use changes as a comparison. The study indicates that MAS has better performance for simulating complex cities than CA.";"Xia Li,Xiaoping Liu,Gar On Yeh Anthony,"
"Accelerating agent-based computation of complex urban systems";"8964248395038901798";"2012";"Despite its popularity, agent-based modeling is limited by serious barriers that con- strain its usefulness as an exploratory tool. In particular, there is a paucity of systematic approaches for extracting coarse-grained, system-level information as it emerges in direct simulation. This is particularly problematic for agent-based models (ABMs) of complex urban systems in which macroscopic phenomena, such as sprawl, may manifest themselves coarsely from bottom-up dynamics among diverse agent-actors interacting across scales. Often these connections are not known, but treating them is nevertheless crucial in enabling prediction, in supporting decisions, and in facilitat- ing the design, control, and optimization of urban systems. In this article, we describe and implement a metasimulation scheme for extracting macroscopic information from local dynamics of agent-based simulation, which allows acceleration of coarse-scale computing and which may also serve as a precursor to handle emergence in complex urban simulation.We compare direct ABM simulation, population-level equation solu- tions, and coarse projective integration.We apply the scheme to the simulation of urban sprawl from local drivers of urbanization, urban growth, and population dynamics. Numerical examples of the three approaches are provided to compare their accuracy and efficiency.We find that our metasimulation scheme can significantly accelerate complex urban simulations while maintaining faithful representation of the original model.";"Ioannis G.

It is applied to a research question in urban geography, namely how well a simple and generic model of a system of cities can reproduce the evolution of Soviet urbanisation. We compared the ability of two models with different levels of complexity to satisfy goals at two levels. The macro-goal is to simulate the evolution of the system’s hierarchical structure. The micro-goal is to simulate its micro-dynamics in a realistic way. The evaluation of the models is based on empirical data through a calibration that includes sensitivity analysis using genetic algorithms and distributed computing. We show that a simple model of spatial interactions cannot fully reproduce the observed evolution of Soviet urbanisation from 1959 to 1989. A better fit was achieved when the model’s structure was complexified with two mechanisms. Our evaluation goals were assessed through intensive sensitivity analysis. The complexified model allowed us to simulate the evolution of the Soviet urban hierarchy.";"Paul Chapron,Clémentine Cottineau,Romain Reuillon,"
"OpenMOLE, a workflow engine specifically tailored for the distributed exploration of simulation models";"11665166017377686868";"2013";"Complex-systems describe multiple levels of collective structure and organization. In such systems, the emergence of global behaviour from local interactions is generally studied through large scale experiments on numerical models. This analysis generates important computation loads which require the use of multi-core servers, clusters or grid computing. Dealing with such large scale executions is especially challenging for modellers who do not possess the theoretical and methodological skills required to take advantage of high performance computing environments. That is why we have designed a cloud approach for model experimentation. This approach has been implemented in OpenMOLE (Open MOdeL Experiment) as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that leverages the naturally parallel aspect of model experiments. The OpenMOLE DSL has been designed to explore user-supplied models. It delegates transparently their numerous executions to remote execution environment. From a user perspective, those environments are viewed as services providing computing power, therefore no technical detail is ever exposed. This paper presents the OpenMOLE DSL through the example of a toy model exploration and through the automated calibration of a real-world complex-system model in the field of geography. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

"Alternative explanations of hierarchical differentiation in urban systems";"5665898058354109834";"2006";"Cities1 always have been the locus of power and social organisation. They were also places of social and technological innovation, accompanying an increasingly complex division of labour and growing economic accumulation. In the history of societies, cities emerged at different moments on different parts of the earth, several thousand years ago, but always after agricultural techniques had been invented (about 3000 years later) and coinciding with new forms of political organisation in society (Bairoch, 1985). The maximum city size increased through history, following demographic and economic growth and technological progress. As recalled by Michael Batty in the preceding chapter, “there are always many more smaller cities than larger ones”. A less known fact is that all through historical times, as well as today in every country, in wider regions such as Europe or even in the entire world, city sizes differentiate in a surprising regular manner: the number of cities follows an inverse geometric progression in relation to their size. It is therefore not surprising if the notion of hierarchy seems almost intrinsic in urban systems, and in the two acceptations mentioned in the introduction to this book.";"Denise Pumain,"
" A small world perspective on urban systems";"5924661491745821842";"2009";"The theory of small world network as initiated by Watts and Strogatz 1998 has drawn new insights on spatial analysis as well as to systems theory. Its concepts and methods are particularly relevant to geography where spatial interaction is mainstream, and where interactions can be described and studied using large volume of exchanges or similarity matrices. Networks indeed organize through direct links or by indirect paths, inducing topological proximities simultaneously involving spatial, social, cultural or organizational dimensions. Network synergies build over similarities and are fed by complementarities between or inside cities, the two effects potentially amplifying each other according to the “preferential attachment” hypothesis that has been explored in a number of different scientific fields (Barabàsi & Albert, 1999  Barabàsi, 2002  Newmann et al., 2006). In fact, according to Barabási & Albert (1999), the high level of hierarchy observed in “scale-free networks” results from “preferential attachment” which characterizes the development of networks: new connections appear preferentially close nodes already having the largest number of connections. In this way, the improvement in the network accessibility of the new connection will probably be greater. But at the same time, network regions gathering dense and numerous weak links (Granovetter, 1973, 1985) or network entities acting as bridges between several components (Burt, 2004) offer a higher capacity for urban communities to benefit from opportunities and create future synergies. Several methodologies have been suggested on how such denser and more coherent regions (also called communities or clusters) in term of links can be identified (Watts & Strogatz, 1998  Watts, 1999  Barabasi & Albert, 2000  Barabasi, 2003  Auber et al. 2003, Newmann et al., 2006). These communities not only possess a high level of dependency between their member entities, but also show a low level of “vulnerability” allowing for numerous redundancies (Burt, 2000, 2005). The SPANGEO project 2005-2008 (SPAtial Networks in GEOgraphy), gathering a team of geographers and computer scientists, has conducted empirical studies to survey concepts and measures developed in other related fields such as physics, sociology or communication science. The relevancy and potential interpretation of weighted or non weighted measures on edges and nodes were examined and analyzed at different scales (intra-urban, inter-urban or both). New classification and clustering schemes based on the relative local density of subgraphs were developed. The article describes how these notions and methods bring a contribution on a conceptual level, in terms of measures, delineations, explanatory analysis and visualization of geographical phenomena. It is shown that, in order to deal in a rigorous way with qualitative information, we can try many tricks. In some cases, the large memories and the power of computation of the machine are enough for facing problems with qualitative data, otherwise non treatable  in other cases, this goal is reached by the possibility of “visualization” of information or “cooperative solution” (through communication) allowed by the computer. Moreover, in some cases the qualitative is managed by means of algorithms (carrying out a sequence of “logical” statements)  in other cases the problem is “hardened” (made quantitative), then the output is “relaxed” (reduced to a probabilistic result). Even if the set of methods is rapidly increasing, we look for a taxonomy of the bulk of tools, according to potential use in geography and planning. Considering, for instance, characterization of geographical objects, spatial statistical analysis, territorial modeling and simulation, etc., every qualitative method (e.g. conceptual maps, ontologies, folksonomies, cladistics, qualitative regression, cross impact analysis, expert systems, etc.) is classified, with a short description of its main features. For a better understanding of meaning, procedures and potentialities of qualitative methods, a brief account of four case-studies is given. A software for building “ontology” is used to map a system of interacting agents  “textual statistics” are applied for analyzing the perception of landscape on the basis of an “open answer” (qualitative) survey  the “cross impact analysis” is the qualitative modeling tool built for the evaluation of the consequences of a land-use project  in a qualitative “multi-criteria evaluation” it is grounded the site selection for location of a big infrastructure. As a conclusion, the perspectives of qualitative methods are discussed, in the light of two emerging phenomena: respectively, the incoming “extreme data” availability age  and the next “highly automatic” computer-based research activity epoch.";"Céline Rozenblat,Guy Melanҫon,"

"Hierarchy, cities size distribution and Zipf's law";"7062493594106605805";"2008";"We show that a hierarchical cities structure can be generated by a self-organized process which grows with a bottom-up mechanism, and that the resulting distribution is power law. First we analytically prove that the power law distribution satisfies the balance between the offer of the city and the demand of its basin of attraction, and that the exponent in the Zipf’s law corresponds to the multiplier linking the population of the central city to the population of its basin of attraction. Moreover, the corresponding hierarchical structure shows a variable spanning factor, and the population of the cities linked to the same city up in the hierarchy is variable as well. Second a stochastic dynamic spatial model is proposed, whose numerical results confirm the analytical findings. In this model, inhabitants minimize the transportation cost, so that the greater the importance of this cost, the more stable is the system in its microscopic aspect. After a comparison with the existent methods for the generation of a power law distribution, conclusions are drawn on the connection of hierarchical structure, and power law distribution, with the functioning of the system of cities.

"From boom to crash: Spanish urban areas in a decade of change (2001–2011)";"6880044337842909935";"2013";"This paper has two main aims: on the one hand, it provides an overview of recent metropolitan area population changes in Spain and assesses their spatial patterns through a typology and on the other hand, it analyses the impact of the current economic crisis on the aforementioned trends. The main source used is the Padron continuo, the local continuous registration system providing official data updated every year on 1 January. Regarding metropolitan area delimitation, we have decided to use that employed by the Atlas de las Areas Urbanas de Espana and to situate the population threshold at 500,000 inhabitants. Fifteen urban areas satisfied the requirements. Therefore, this paper analyses, for the 2001-2011 decade, population growth and urban expansion in the 15 Spanish largest metropolitan areas. In the first phase, suburbanisation intensified while the areas simultaneously received significant international migration inflows. The latter compensated Spaniards' exit flows from core cities, which increased their population again. The economic crisis, which began in 2008, and its significant impact on the real estate sector, drew an end to this urban expansion and growth period, as it seems to have slowed Spanish metropolitan area growth and restrained suburbanisation dynamics. Consequently, in recent years, residential mobility has decreased and metropolitan areas have entered a new phase characterised by a reduction of both foreign immigration inflows and Spaniards' movements away from core cities. Therefore, with few exceptions, urban centres are currently once again gaining Spanish residents or at least have stopped losing them.";"J. Bayona-i-Carrasco,I. Pujadas-i-Rubies,F. Gil-Alonso,"

O fio condutor adotado segue o princípio segundo o qual SAPL é um conceito fundamentalmente evolucionista, valendo-se, portanto, dos legados deixados por J. Schumpeter, R. Nelson, S. Winter, C. Freeman e muitos outros. Entende-se, no entanto, que essa plataforma pode ficar mais robusta com a incorporação dos conceitos forjados pelos novos institucionalistas, para compreender, sobretudo, as questões vinculadas às formas de coordenação e governança dos agentes do sistema. O artigo argumenta que SAPL é parte da família dos Sistemas Complexos e Adaptativos, o que significa que este é relativamente autônomo, comparado a outros aplicados em análises sobre aglomerações de empresas. Consequentemente, é razoável considerar que, o referido conceito, é passível de ser instrumentalizado em realidades econômicas e sociais que apresentam agentes produtivos que se vinculam por meio de interações.";"Jair do Amaral Filho,"

"Agent-based land-use models: a review of applications";"652063192790900003";"2007";"Agent-based modelling is an approach that has been receiving attention by the land use \nmodelling community in recent years, mainly because it offers a way of incorporating the influence of human decision-making on land use in a mechanistic, formal, and spatially explicit way, taking into account social interaction, adaptation, and decision-making at different levels. A number of such models are now beginning to appear – it is timely, therefore, to review the uses to which agent-based land use models have been put so far, and to discuss some of the relevant lessons learnt, also drawing on those from other areas of simulation modelling, in relation to future applications. In this paper, we review applications of agent-based land use models under the headings of \n(a) policy analysis and planning, (b) participatory modelling, (c) explaining spatial patterns of land use or settlement, (d) testing social science concepts, and (e) explaining land use functions. The greatest use of such models so far has been by the research community as tools for organising knowledge from empirical studies, and for exploring theoretical aspects of particular systems. However, there is a need to demonstrate that such models are able to solve problems in the real world better than traditional modelling approaches. It is concluded that in terms of decision support, agent-based land-use models are probably more useful as research tools to develop an underlying knowledge base which can then be developed together with end-users into simple rules-of-thumb, rather than as operational decision support tools.";"Nick M.

" Authenticity, Power, and Pluralism: A Framework for Understanding Stakeholder Evaluations of Corporate Social Responsibility Activities";"17115068731316785820";"2016";"We explore the essential contestedness of corporate social responsibility (CSR) by framing the interplay between CSR activities and stakeholder evaluations as a contest for jurisdiction over what it means to be socially responsible. This contest arises because firms and stakeholders are often guided by incompatible sensemaking systems. To show why context matters we show how stakeholders evaluate the authenticity of CSR activities on the basis of schemas for responsible behavior on one hand and their perceptions of firm identity on the other. This process can generate complex evaluations whose meaning depends on the distribution of power in fields and the extent to which pluralistic sensemaking systems are compatible. By positioning authenticity evaluations within a framework that describes the state of power and pluralism within which they are produced, we are able to present a systematic explanation of how and why stakeholder responses to CSR vary over a range of settings";"Paul F Skilton,Jill M Purdy,"

The paper opens with taxonomy of urban simulation models and a treatment of descriptive and analytical models. This serves to situate land-use–transportation models in the context of a broader simulation environment. The paper then reviews land-use–transportation models according to their simulation techniques and individual components. Towards the second half of the paper, the discussion moves to a critical overview of urban simulation and deals with model weaknesses and strengths in a holistic fashion, before concluding with a discussion of some innovations in academic research that are likely to shape future models.";"Paul M Torrens,"

"Can modelling enable us to understand the role of humans in landscape evolution?";"480879001045677395";"2008";"Landform-evolution models have typically failed to include human actions, or have done so only in a static, scenario-based way. This failure is despite the extensive empirical data that suggest rates of soil erosion are most sensitive to anthropic pressure. The CybErosion modelling framework overcomes this limitation by using an agent-based approach to simulating the dynamic interactions of people and their landscapes. The interactions simulated relate to basic processes of food acquisition (hunting, gathering and basic agriculture) in prehistoric communities. Simulations demonstrate the value of this approach in supporting the vulnerability of landform evolution to anthropic pressures, and demonstrate the limitations of existing models that ignore human and animal agency, which are likely to produce both quantitatively and qualitatively different results. The model is also a useful heuristic tool for understanding human-landscape interactions and for suggesting directions for future research. Despite the acknowledged limitations of agent-based approaches in simulating human populations, it is suggested that further research will be fruitful, especially if combined with a range of field evidence. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization becomes more challenging if a large set of spatial data with fine resolutions are used. This article presents an agent-based model for optimal land allocation (AgentLA) by maximizing the total amount of land-use suitability and the compactness of patterns. The essence of the optimization is based on the collective efforts of agents for formulating the optimal patterns. A local and global search strategy is proposed to inform the agents to select the sites properly. Three sets of hypothetical data were first used to verify the optimization effects. AgentLA was then applied to the solution of the actual land allocation optimization problems in Panyu city in the Pearl River Delta.

"Constructal theory and its relevance to green energy";"3197485075833474302";"2007";"Constructal theory is the thought that the generation of flow configurations is a phenomenon of physics. Flow configuration, such as the trees of liver basins, lungs and city traffic unite the natural with the engineered, and the animate with the inanimate. The physics principle that accounts for the generation of flow configuration everywhere is the constructal law (Bejan, 1997, p. 807): For a finite-size flow system to persist (to survive) it must morph in time such that it provides easier access to the currents that flow through it. Why is the constructal law relevant to green energy? For lack of an official definition of green energy, we assume that green energy means man going about his business without changing the environment much' This thought defines the plane on which constructal theory is relevant. How can human action change the environment the least? The answer is delivered by the constructal law, which prescribes the ways in which humans can engineer machines that use minimal fossil fuels. Everything that Sadi Carnot (1824) said about making better machines is the constructal law, and is relevant to green energy. To persist in time (to survive), our flows must flow most easily (most efficiently) and be optimally matched to (i.e., in harmony with) the flows of the environment. Our trees of energy production, economics, business and garbage disposal must mate optimally with the trees of the environment (river basins, atmospheric and oceanic circulation).";"a. Bejan,S.

Second, we briefly review the main trends in the application of fractals to urban issues : the description of urban morphologies (built-up areas, distribution of activities, networks, borders...), the simulation of urban growth and settlement systems analysis.

Using recent data on population and employment in French urban functional areas, we show that the spatial and temporal framework in which urban growth is computed may considerably alter the results and their consecutive interpretation. When the city is defined as a continuously built-up area (the French agglomération), the measurement of concentration of urban population does not give the same result than when using as a definition the spatial scale of functional urban areas (the French aires urbaines). Similarly, the analyse of the spatial redistribution of population between urban centres, close and outer suburbs are reconsidered under trends of a longer duration has been given very different results, according to the way of defining cities and spaces.";"Fabien Paulus,Anne Bretagnolle,Denise Pumain,"
"Large city interaction in the US urban system";"4577215082451786822";"2000";"Mounting interest in the global system of cities has led many scholars to portray large, world-class cities as control points in the global economy. From this position, they govern global banking, finance and international corporate relations with the assistance of advanced business services and telecommunications. While large cities have taken on many global functions, recent research has cast them only as outposts in the global economy and pays little attention to their role in regional and national economies. This paper explores the role of five large US cities in regional and national economies. Using primary trade data for five high-order business services, we identify the extent to which these large cities trade with other large cities of the US urban system, smaller-sized cities, and test statistically the effect that firm attributes and physical characteristics of the city system have on shaping the areal extent of large city interaction (trade). The results indicate that: trade is consistently biased towards other large cities  the size of origin cities is associated with the size of destination cities  and, distance more so than destination city size plays the dominant role in shaping large city patterns of trade.";"A.J.

"Systèmes de villes et niveaux d'organisation";"13829101603307372136";"2006";"Dans les villes comme dans les territoires apparaissent des propriétés émergentes, issues des différentes formes d'échanges et d'interactions qui se produisent entre les acteurs urbains, à plus ou moins longue distance. Ces propriétés sont caractéristiques de l'organisation des villes en réseaux, en systèmes, à des niveaux meso- ou macro-géographiques, Elles contraignent à leur tour les actions sociales comme le devenir de chaque ville, dans la mesure où elles constituent des règles « spontanées » de l'évolution des villes. Certaines de ces propriétés rapprochent les formes d'organisation des systèmes urbains de celles de systèmes physiques, tellement les régularités observées sont générales et universelles. Peut-on alors imaginer les expliquer par de simples modèles dynamiques, certes non linéaires, dont le fonctionnement serait indépendant du temps et des règles propres à chaque société ? On examine comment la structuration des systèmes urbains a pu être décrite par des modèles de croissance stochastique, ou des modèles géométriques (type fractales), ou bien par des modèles économiques a-temporels. On insiste ensuite sur le fait que ces systèmes sont des objets sociaux qu'il importe de considérer dans leur dimension évolutive, par exemple pour interpréter sur la longue durée l'émergence de leur structure et ses transformations, notamment sous l'effet des modifications technologiques de l'espace-temps sociétal, et jusqu'à quel point il faut prendre en compte les accidents marquants de leur histoire pour en comprendre les particularités de forme.

In this article, we focus on these last aspects by studying phone data recorded during 55 days in 31 Spanish cities. We first define an urban dilatation index which measures how the average distance between individuals evolves during the day, allowing us to highlight different types of city structure. We then focus on hotspots, the most crowded places in the city. We propose a parameter free method to detect them and to test the robustness of our results. The number of these hotspots scales sublinearly with the population size, a result in agreement with previous theoretical arguments and measures on employment datasets. We study the lifetime of these hotspots and show in particular that the hierarchy of permanent ones, which constitute the 'heart' of the city, is very stable whatever the size of the city. The spatial structure of these hotspots is also of interest and allows us to distinguish different categories of cities, from monocentric and segregated where the spatial distribution is very dependent on land use, to polycentric where the spatial mixing between land uses is much more important. These results point towards the possibility of a new, quantitative classification of cities using high resolution spatio-temporal data.";"E Frias-Martinez,T Louail,M Picornell,M Barthelemy,R Herranz,O G Cantu Ros,J J Ramasco,M Lenormand,"

The question of which are the driving forces of change in a settlement system is raised. Then different ways for building hybrid models combining dynamics referring to different scales are discussed. I refer to the example of SimPop, a MAS model which simulates the emergence and the evolution of a settlement system on a period of 2000 years, in order to illustrate how a function of urban governance that ensures both cognitive and decisional capacities for the evolution of cities can be introduced in a model whose rules are principally built on meso-level regularities.";"Lena Sanders,"
" An evolutionary theory for interpreting urban scaling laws";"4032759008048105645";"2006";"We try here to illustrate the relevance of an evolutionary theory of urban systems for explaining their hierarchical properties. The largest cities became larger because they were successful in adopting many successive innovations. Larger cities capture innovations in a continuous way (through adaptation, imitation, anticipation), and they concentrate a larger part of anything «new» at any time. Their functions demonstrate a higher level of complexity or sophistication of their urban activity and society. The most advanced technologies concentrate in largest cities, the common place activities are ubiquitous, whereas old ones remain in small towns only (or, in economic terms, there are increasing, constant or decreasing returns to urban scale). Such regularities can be expressed in the form of scaling laws that were recognised as revealing specific constraints on the structure and evolution of complex systems in physics and biology. Approaching urban activities by scaling laws provides a linkage between the concepts of urban function, city size, and innovation cycles. Over time, there is a substitution among the activities of the largest cities, where the oldest technologies and professions are replaced by the new ones, while the old ones are relatively concentrating in the smallest towns. Such an evolution is observed within urban systems where cities are fully connected and interdependent. There are processes of cooperation through exchanges of information and learning that enable an incremental diffusion of innovation and a continuous adaptation of urban activities and society in all parts of the system. Meanwhile, there are also processes of competition between cities that enhance their capacity to innovate and to levy the benefits of innovation. A distributed process of urban growth including a slight but continuing advantage for the largest cities is the result of that competitive process, while the successive adaptation of the urban functions follows the economic and social innovation cycles. © CYBERGEO 2006.";"Céline Vacchiani-Marcuzzo,Fabien Paulus,Denise Pumain,Jose Lobo,"
"Why retailers cluster: an agent model of location choice on supply chains";"14351467092924630850";"2011";"This paper investigates the emergence of retail clusters on supply chains comprised of suppliers, retailers, and consumers. An agent-based model is employed to study retail location choice in a market of homogeneous goods and a market of complementary goods. On a circle comprised of discrete locales, retailers play a noncooperative game by choosing locales to maximize profits which are impacted by their distance to consumers and to suppliers. Our findings disclose that in a market of homogeneous products symmetric distributions of retail clusters arise out of competition between individual retailers  average cluster density and cluster size change dynamically as retailers enter the market. In a market of two complementary goods, multiple equilibria of retail distributions are found to be common  a single cluster of retailers has the highest probability to emerge. Overall, our results show that retail clusters emerge from the balance between retailers' proximity to their customers, their competitors, their complements, and their suppliers.";"Arthur Huang,David Levinson,"
"Multi-Agent Systems for Urban Planning";"7793160565533369217";"2014";"Cities provide homes for over half of the world’s population, and this proportion is expected to increase throughout the next century. The growth of cities raises many questions and challenges for urban plan- ning including which cities and regions are most likely to grow, what the pattern of urban growth will be, and how the existing infrastructure will cope with such growth. One way to explore these types of questions is through the use of multi-agent systems (MAS) that are capable of modeling how individuals interact and how structures emerge through such interactions, in terms of both the social and physical environment of cities. Within this chapter, the authors focus on how MAS can lead to insights into urban problems and aid urban planning from the bottom up. They review MAS models that explore the growth of cities and regions, models that explore land-use patterns resulting from such growth along with the rise of slums. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate how MAS models can be used to model transpor- tation and the changing demographics of cities.

"The open source software development phenomenon: An analysis based on social network theory";"3750653309408772417";"2002";"The OSS movement is a phenomenon that challenges many traditional theories in economics, software engineering, business strategy, and IT management. Thousands of software programmers are spending tremendous amounts of time and effort writing and debugging software, most often with no direct monetary compensation. The programs, some of which are extremely large and complex, are written without the benefit of traditional project management, change tracking, or error checking techniques. Since the programmers are working outside of a traditional organizational reward structure, accountability is an issue as well. A significant portion of internet e-commerce runs on OSS, and thus many firms have little choice but to trust mission-critical e-commerce systems to run on such software, requiring IT management to deal with new types of socio-technical problems. A better understanding of how the OSS community functions may help IT planners make more informed decisions and develop more effective strategies for using OSS software. We hypothesize that open source software development can be modeled as self-organizing, collaboration, social networks. We analyze structural data on over 39,000 open source projects hosted at SourceForge.net involving over 33,000 developers. We define two software developers to be connected — part of a collaboration social network — if they are members of the same project, or are connected by a chain of connected developers. Project sizes, developer project participation, and clusters of connected developers are analyzed. We find evidence to support our hypothesis, primarily in the presence of power-law relationships on project sizes (number of developers per project), project membership (number of projects joined by a developer), and cluster sizes. Potential implications for IT researchers, IT managers, and governmental policy makers are discussed.";"Renee Tynan,Vincent Freeh,Greg Madey,"

Suburban sprawl, a relatively recent phenomenon, is among the most important urban policy issues facing con-temporary cities. To date, a well-accepted rationale has not been settled on for explaining and managing the causes of sprawl. Our contention is that consideration of geography is essential-that geographical explanations offer much potential in informing the debate about sprawl. Similarly, spatial simulation could support sprawl-related research, offering what-if experimentation environments for exploring issues relating to the phenomenon.";"Paul M. Torrens,"
"Assessing the quality of multilevel graph clustering";"9972668981206541951";"2014";"“Lifting up” a non-hierarchical approach to handle hierarchical clustering by iteratively applying the approach to hierarchically cluster a graph is a popular strategy. However, these lifted iterative strategies cannot reasonably guide the overall nesting process precisely because they fail to evaluate the very hierarchical character of the clustering they produce. In this study, we develop a criterion that can evaluate the quality of the subgraph hierarchy. The multilevel criterion we present and discuss in this paper generalizes a measure designed for a one-level (flat) graph clustering to take nesting of the clusters into account. We borrow ideas from standard techniques in algebraic combinatorics and exploit a variable qq to keep track of the depth of clusters at which edges occur. Our multilevel measure relies on a recursive definition involving variable qq outputting a one-variable polynomial. This paper examines archetypal examples as proofs-of-concept  these simple cases are useful in understanding how the multilevel measure actually works. We also apply this multilevel modularity to real world networks to demonstrate how it can be used to compare hierarchical clusterings of graphs.";"François Queyroi,Maylis Delest,Jean Marc Fédou,Guy Melançon,"
" “Space, the Final Frontier”: How Good are Agent-Based Models at Simulating Individuals and Space in Cities?";"5888546769254925637";"2016";"Cities are complex systems, comprising of many interacting parts. How we simulate and understand causality in urban systems is continually evolving. Over the last decade the agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm has provided a new lens for understanding the effects of interactions of individuals and how through such interactions macro structures emerge, both in the social and physical environment of cities. However, such a paradigm has been hindered due to computational power and a lack of large fine scale datasets. Within the last few years we have witnessed a massive increase in computational processing power and storage, combined with the onset of Big Data. Today geographers find themselves in a data rich era. We now have access to a variety of data sources (e.g., social media, mobile phone data, etc.) that tells us how, and when, individuals are using urban spaces. These data raise several questions: can we effectively use them to understand and model cities as complex entities? How well have ABM approaches lent themselves to simulating the dynamics of urban processes? What has been, or will be, the influence of Big Data on increasing our ability to understand and simulate cities? What is the appropriate level of spatial analysis and time frame to model urban phenomena? Within this paper we discuss these questions using several examples of ABM applied to urban geography to begin a dialogue about the utility of ABM for urban modeling. The arguments that the paper raises are applicable across the wider research environment where researchers are considering using this approach.";"Nick Malleson,Alison Heppenstall,Andrew Crooks,"
"Multiscale optimization for the management of runoff risks in agricultural watersheds";"3860920321934236702";"2007";"This paper presents a novel combined optimization approach to the problem of runoff risk management in agricultural watersheds. Starting with important rains, the runoff risk increases according to the agricultural activities practiced by farmers on their parcels of land. To minimize the risk, we propose to optimize the distribution of crops on the parcels. The redistribution must take into account a number of agronomic, economic, and hydrologic constraints. Two criteria allow the estimation of the runoff risks. On the scale of the digital terrain model, a cellular automaton evaluates a global criterion at the watershed outlet. At the scale of the parcels, a local criterion evaluates the modification of risks generated by a variation of crops on two parcels. We compare the results of these two criteria on the watershed of Villers-Ecalles, Haute Normandie, France.";"Wassim Jaziri,"

This theory develops an explanation from the geographic point of view, to their inequalities and their differences in terms of size, area and socio-economic profile, which will allow, to a certain degree, to predict evolution. This research was originally inspired by recurring questions regarding urban growth. Toward the end of the 1960s European cities were still attracting many migrants from the neighbouring countryside  each had their own policies on housing construction, development of access roads, industrial zone propositions, modernisation of businesses and soon on the creation of pedestrian zones and on improvements to old city-centres. The explanations given to these developments almost always relied on favourable local conditions, often the result of a particularly perceptive initiative by the implied actors, town hall, chamber of commerce or entrepreneurs. Economists or sociologists interpreted these processes according to collective systems at the national or even international scale, in terms of rural depopulation, Fordist production or urbanisation of the society. Could we not discover geographical reasons explaining why the same types of changes appear to have occurred simultaneously everywhere?";"Denise Pumain,"

A global matrix of interurban vessel flows was elaborated for about 600 cities using data from the GeopolisandLloyd’s Shipping Indexdatabases and the rigorous assignment of ports to both coastal and inland urban areas. Main results show that although the largest cities have witnessed a diminishing importance in world traffic, they have maintained their dominance in the network in terms of centrality and geographic reach. This research thus contributes to question the ineluctable separation between ports and cities which dominated the literature, while offering new empirical evidence about the structure and dynamics of city-systems and spatial networks in general.";"César Ducruet,Ali EL Hosni,Sylvain Cuyala,"

The content of these categories changes in terms of the quantitative thresholds or the qualitative\nattributes used for defining them at each date, but they retain the same meaning in terms of the relative situation of cities\nin the urban systems. Hierarchical differentiation and socio-economic specialization are the major structural features shared\nby all city systems.

The combined outcomes of these changes for the urban system, however, remain ambiguous.This paper examines some of the contradictory assertions in the research literature regarding the on-going reorganization of urban systems through a detailed empirical analysis of the changing properties of the Canadian urban system. The analysis begins with a conceptual framework that recognizes alternative logics and trajectories of change in urban systems, the latter expressed for analytical purposes as simple polarities. The paper then demonstrates not only the diversity and rapidity of change, with its intensely uneven geography, but the often indeterminant and contadictory nature of many of the relationships underlying that change., (C)1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers";"L.

"Zipf's law and Canadian urban growth";"5314577806673084220";"2013";"The purpose of this paper is to study the hierarchical structure of the Canadian urban system and to determine the growth processes. Zipf’s law is rejected for the whole country for all periods because of a clear size-domination by a few big cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. It appears that the dynamics of growth follow a deterministic process related to existing urban size, previous growth and spatial structure. Splitting the Canadian urban system into two—east and west— permits the identification of differences that were not observable when studying the country as a whole. While size and previous growth are still important explanatory variables of growth patterns, these two systems may be distinguished one from the other from the point of view of spatial patterns of distribution of growth rates.";"Aurélie Lalanne,"

" The Size Distribution, Scaling Properties and Spatial Organization of Urban Clusters: A Global and Regional Percolation Perspective";"17340109782295601584";"2016";"Human development has far-reaching impacts on the surface of the globe. The transformation of natural land cover occurs in different forms, and urban growth is one of the most eminent transformative processes. We analyze global land cover data and extract cities as defined by maximally connected urban clusters. The analysis of the city size distribution for all cities on the globe confirms Zipf’s law. Moreover, by investigating the percolation properties of the clustering of urban areas we assess the closeness to criticality for various countries. At the critical thresholds, the urban land cover of the countries undergoes a transition from separated clusters to a gigantic component on the country scale. We study the Zipf-exponents as a function of the closeness to percolation and find a systematic dependence, which could be the reason for deviating exponents reported in the literature. Moreover, we investigate the average size of the clusters as a function of the proximity to percolation and find country specific behavior. By relating the standard deviation and the average of cluster sizes—analogous to Taylor’s law—we suggest an alternative way to identify the percolation transition. We calculate spatial correlations of the urban land cover and find long-range correlations. Finally, by relating the areas of cities with population figures we address the global aspect of the allometry of cities, finding an exponent δ ≈ 0.85, i.e., large cities have lower densities.";"Diego Rybski,Till Fluschnik,Bin Zhou,Dominik Reusser,Jürgen Kropp,Steffen Kriewald,Anselmo García Cantú Ros,"

These measures are often used at the interurban level and neglect the intraurban processes of multiplier effects. The present study demonstrates that this affects the measurement of city centrality in business networks. Intraurban capabilities of interaction are considered in the measurement of interurban indices. The study is based on hypothetical networks at a micro level between long-range links and it mobilises processes as agglomeration economies, social capital developments and transaction costs. These processes at the intraurban level strengthen the efficiency of interurban linkages. It is suggested that the indices used to measure city centrality should include these local effects. Applied to a small sample of six firm networks, the methodology shows advantages for emerging large metropolises, but insufficient local effects for specialised clusters. The multilevel approach offers improved perspectives for the comparison of city centralities.";"Céline Rozenblat,"

Cette méthode s’appuie en amont sur deux choix théoriques, l’utilisation d’un référentiel spatio-temporel pour construire des agglomérations de municipalités dès 1870 (définies par un rayon maximal d’une heure de temps à chaque époque) et une définition des villes en tant qu’aires fonctionnelles dès que cela est possible, soit à partir de 1940. Deux types d’aires fonctionnelles co-existent dans notre base. Tout d’abord, les aires métropolitaines, dont la définition change à plusieurs reprises (Standard Metropolitain Areas en 1949, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas en 1958 et Statistical Metropolitan Areas en 1983). Nous établissons une liste de critères pour corriger certains périmètres d’aires, de manière à ce que la trajectoire des objets (observée du point de vue de leur population et de leur surface) reste cohérente dans le temps malgré ces changements de définition. Ces aires étant définies en très petit nombre, nous rétropolons jusqu’en 1940 la délimitation des aires micropolitaines (Micropolitan Statistical Areas) définies officiellement au recensement de 2000. Nous montrons ensuite les cartes (semis, trame, emprise spatiale) issues de cette base harmonisée, qui donnent une vision globale et unifiée de l’urbanisation des Etats-Unis sur deux siècles.

" From theory to modelling: urban systems as complex systems";"11560201488980627559";"2006";"The question of complexity and its increasing application to social sciences is challenging the modelling of spatial systems. New concepts and new methods have been proposed and invite to reformulate classical modelling frames. This approach is demanding to open a better informed dialogue between the disciplines which supply models and tools and those where the existing knowledge is reformulated inside this new frame. Actually, creating an « artificial geography » is not straightforward. It is rather easy to translate urban theories within the paradigm of complex systems, but their modelling, for instance by using multi-agents systems, still raises many conceptual and practical difficulties. We underline here some problems in defining significant urban entities and exploring the evolution of their spatial relationships over time. We briefly present which options have been selected for developing the SIMPOP2 model which is conceived for simulating the evolution of systems of cities over long periods of time.";"Eric Daudet,Anne Bretagnolle,Denise Pumain,"

Rules and parameters are introduced into a multiagent systems formalism where each settlement is considered as a separate entity interacting with the others and transforming itself. The rules may allow for the simulation of the 'urban transition' from a set of homogeneous, agriculture-oriented, and scattered villages into a complex system of functionally diverse, competing, and hierarchised urban settlements. In this paper we show how several modifica-tions of rules and parameters alter further the spatial and hierarchical structure of the simulated urban system.";"S. Bura,L. Sanders,D. Pumain,H.

"Mind, the gap in landscape‐evolution modelling";"4253829945097209492";"2010";"Despite an increasing recognition that human activity is currently the dominant force modifying landscapes, and that this activity has been increasing through the Holocene, there has been little integrative work to evaluate human interactions with geomorphic processes. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are a useful tool for overcoming the limitations of existing, highly empirical approaches. In particular, they allow the integration of decision-making into process-based models and provide a heuristic way of evaluating the compatibility of knowledge gained from a wide range of sources, both within and outwith the discipline of geomorphology. The application of ABMs to geomorphology is demonstrated from two different perspectives. The SPASIMv1 (Special Protection Area SIMulator version 1) model is used to evaluate the potential impacts of land-use change – particularly in relation to wildfire and subsequent soil conditions, runoff and erosion – over a decadal timescale from the present day to the mid-twenty-first century. It focuses on the representation of farmers with traditional versus commercial perspectives in central Spain, and highlights the importance of land-tenure structure and historical contingencies of individuals' decision-making. CYBEROSION, however, considers changes in erosion and deposition over the scale of at least centuries. It represents both wild and domesticated animals and humans as model agents, and investigates the interactions of them in the context of early agriculturalists in southern France in a prehistoric context. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the ABM approach, and consider some of the major challenges. These challenges include potential process-scale mismatches, differences in perspective between investigators from different disciplines, and issues regarding model evaluation, analysis and interpretation. If the challenges can be overcome, this fully integrated approach will provide geomorphology a means to conceptualize soundly the study of human–landscape interactions by bridging the gap between social and physical approaches.

Empirical evidence of the corresponding patterns and processes is provided for three main styles of urbanization, exemplified in four different parts of the world.";"Celine Vacchiani-Marcuzzo,Anne Bretagnolle,Denise Pumain,"
"A theoretical framework for evolutionary economic geography: industrial dynamics and urban growth as a branching process";"3019233341377361221";"2007";"We propose a framework that specifies the process of economic development as an evolutionary branching process of product innovations. Each product innovation provides a growth opportunity for an existing firm or a new firm, and for an existing city or a new city. One can then obtain both firm size and city size distributions as two aggregates resulting from a single evolutionary process. Gains from variety at the firm level (economies of scope) and the urban level (Jacobs externalities) provide the central feedback mechanism in economic development generating strong path dependencies in the spatial concentration of industries and the specialization of cities. Gains from size are also expected, yet these are ultimately bounded by increasing wages. The contribution of our framework lies in providing a micro-foundation of economic geography in terms of the interplay between industrial dynamics and urban growth. The framework is sufficiently general to investigate systematically a number of stylized facts in economic geography, while at the same time it is sufficiently flexible to be extended such as to become applicable in more specific micro-contexts. A number of extensions related to the concepts of knowledge spillover and lock-in, are also discussed.";"K. Frenken,Ron Boschma,"
" Evolving Urbanisation Policies-Using a Statistical Model to Accelerate Optimisation over Agent-based Simulations.";"15410774846022376480";"2013";"Agent-based systems are commonly used in the geographical land use sciences to model processes such as urban growth. In some cases, agents represent civic decision-makers, iteratively making decisions about the sale, purchase and development of patches of land. Based on simple assumptions, such systems are able broadly to model growth scenarios with plausible properties and patterns that can support decision-makers. However, the computational time complexity of simulations limits the use of such systems. Attractive possibilities, such as the optimisation of urban growth policies, tend to be unexplored since the time required to run many thousands of simulations is unacceptable. In this paper we address this situation by exploring an approach that makes use of a statistical model of the agent-based system's behaviour to inform a rapid approximation of the fitness function. This requires a limited number of prior simulations, and then allows the use of an evolutionary algorithm to optimise urban growth policies, where the quality of a policy is evaluated within a highly uncertain environment. The approach is tested on a typical urban growth simulation, in which the overall goal is to find policies that maximise the 'satisfaction' of the residents. We find that the model-driven approximation of the simulation is effective at leading the evolutionary algorithm towards policies that yield vastly better satisfaction levels than unoptimised policies.";"David W.

However, serious difficulties exist in faithfully modeling such systems across scales. Fundamentally new simulation architectures may be required to address conventional policy, for which cross-scale complexities present a challenge. We introduce a new modeling approach for modeling urban-regional systems from the bottom-up and the top-down, using polyspatial computational agents that are capable of functioning and adapting flexibly across scales, allowing a greater range of questions to be posed in simulation. We prove the usefulness of this approach in evaluating policy scenarios";"Atsushi Nara,Paul M Torrens,"
"High-resolution integrated modelling of the spatial dynamics of urban and regional systems";"12078638533869125411";"2000";"An emerging branch of geocomputing involves the modelling of spatial processes. A variety of techniques are being used, the most important being traditional regional system dynamics approaches, multi-agent systems, and cellular automata (CA). The techniques are frequently combined to model processes operating at different spatial scales. Urban and regional models based on CA give good representations of the spatial dynamics of land use. In a current application, a cellular model of The Netherlands at 500 m resolution is driven by a macro-scale dynamical spatial interaction model defined on 40 economic regions  this model is in turn driven by national planning projections and policy goals. Given the national totals, the macro-scale model generates regional demands for population and a number of economic activities. These demands are translated into demands for cell space, which the CA then attempts to locate. In turn, information on conditions at the cellular level, such as the quantity and quality of land available to various activities and actual densities at the cellular scale, are returned to the regional model to modify parameter values there. Linking the two models operating at the two scales improves the performance of both. The results of high-resolution modelling of spatial dynamics raise several methodological issues. One of the most pressing concerns evaluation of the results. Another issue concerns predictability. To the extent that these models capture the evolving nature of real cities and regions, they cannot be strictly predictive. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

" Space-time contraction and the dynamics of urban systems";"12441624726891572241";"1998";"An attempt is made to identify the dynamics of urban systems during the historical process of their evolution. An illustration is made with the case of European cities between 1200 and 1990, using harmonised historical data bases. Simple maps show first a general expansion in cities number and size over time, reflecting the ability of the system to continuously adapt its structure over time. A second trend is an increased hierarchisation in city size, which may be related to the continuous improvement in the speed and capacity of transportation means. Because of this space-time contraction, large cities short-circuit small towns, and inequalities in city size are widening. A third trend leading to a spatial reorganisation, emerges from maps of the urban population potentials. Among all possible mathematical equations and parameters values which could describe the intensity and the spatial range of interactions between cities, we choose those which give rather stable results and which are compatible with the analysis of urban historians, as De Vries, Braudel, Bairoch, Hohenberg and Lees, for the centuries preceding industrial revolution, by using evaluations of distances in terms of time and cost. Urban systems dynamics is better approached with reference to this relative space than on usual topographic maps.";"Céline Rozenblat,Anne Bretagnolle,Denise Pumain,"

"Multi-city sustainable regional urban growth simulation—MSRUGS: a case study along the mid-section of Silk Road of China";"14758667497137119802";"2014";"Abstract Urban growth along the middle section of the ancient silk-road of China (so called West Yellow River Corridor—He-Xi Corridor) has taken a unique path devi- ating from what is commonly seen in the coastal China. Urban growth here has been driven by historical heritage, transportation connection between East and West China, and mineral exploitation. However, it has been constrained by water shortage and harsh natural environment because this region is located in arid and semi-arid climate zones. This paper attempts to construct a multi-city agent-based model to explore possible trajectories of regional urban growth along the entire He-Xi Corridor under a severe environment risk, over urban growth under an extreme threat of water shortage. In contrast with current ABM approaches, our model will simulate urban growth in a large administrative region consisting of a system of cities. It simultaneously considers the spatial variations of these cities in terms of population size, development history, water resource endowment and sustainable development potential. It also explores potential impacts of exogenous inter-city interactions on future urban growth on the basis of urban gravity model. The algorithmic foundations of three types of agents, developers, conservationists and regional-planners, are discussed.

"Simulating spatial urban expansion based on a physical process";"10764287420817036299";"2003";"Urban expansion as a dynamic process of land use change is a complicated social/economic phenomenon. It may be linked with details related to topography, transportation, land use, social structure and economic type, but it is generally related to demography and economy in a city. It is helpful for macro-planning and decision-making to have a simulation model available which considers these two factors. Since the spatial appearance of urban expansion is similar in some degree with a physical diffusion process, one easy way to model urban expansion under various scenarios is to build a simulation model based on basic diffusion. In this way, a clear mechanism of urban expansion is demonstrated. Population density is regarded as an internal driving factor and economy as an external push on urban expansion. Because of its computational features, this model is implemented with cellular automata. These have an advantage in that they allow the model to be extended and to be incorporated with other geographical systems. By applying the model to an actual example for scenario studies, we have shown that it can produce some valuable results through simulations at various scenarios. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.";"Haihong Zhu,Lin Li,Yohei Sato,"

In this paper I show how these new approaches are consistent with traditional urban models that have gone before, with the emphasis no longer being on spatial interaction but on development dynamics and local movement. I first introduce ideas about urban simulation based on spatial evolution as reaction and diffusion, showing how problems conceived in terms of cells and/or agents enable new implementations of this generic model. I sketch the rudiments of cellular automata which emphasise rules for development transition, and agent-based models which focus on how individuals respond to environmental attributes encoded in cellular landscapes. I illustrate these exemplars through models of residential location. Three applications are then presented at very different spatial scales: pedestrian movement at the building scale, the evolution of systems of cities at a regional scale, and urban growth at the city scale. I conclude with proposals that formal policy analysis in this domain should always be informed by more than one approach.";"Michael Batty,"

"Night on Earth: Mapping decadal changes of anthropogenic night light in Asia";"8496073711774277333";"2013";"The defense meteorological satellite program (DMSP) operational linescan system (OLS) sensors have imaged emitted light from Earth's surface since the 1970s. Temporal overlap in the missions of 5 OLS sensors allows for intercalibration of the annual composites over the past 19 years (Elvidge et al., 2009). The resulting image time series captures a spatiotemporal signature of the growth and evolution of lighted human settlements and development. We use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and the temporal feature space to characterize and quantify patterns of temporal change in stable night light brightness and spatial extent since 1992. Temporal EOF analysis provides a statistical basis for representing spatially abundant temporal patterns in the image time series as uncorrelated vectors of brightness as a function of time from 1992 to 2009. The variance partition of the eigenvalue spectrum combined with temporal structure of the EOFs and spatial structure of the PCs provides a basis for distinguishing between deterministic multi-year trends and stochastic year-to-year variance. The low order EOFs and principal components (PC) space together discriminate both earlier (1990s) and later (2000s) increases and decreases in brightness. Inverse transformation of these low order dimensions reduces stochastic variance sufficiently so that tri-temporal composites depict potentially deterministic decadal trends. The most pronounced changes occur in Asia. At critical brightness threshold we find an 18% increase in the number of spatially distinct lights and an 80% increase in lighted area in southern and eastern Asia between 1992 and 2009. During this time both China and India experienced a ~20% increase in number of lights and a ~270% increase in lighted area - although the timing of the increase is later in China than in India. Throughout Asia a variety of different patterns of brightness increase are apparent in tri-temporal brightness composites - as well as some conspicuous areas of apparently decreasing background luminance and, in many places, intermittent light suggesting development of infrastructure rather than persistently lighted development. Vicarious validation using higher resolution Landsat imagery verifies multiple phases of urban growth in several cities as well as the consistent presence of low DN (<~15) background luminance for many agricultural areas. Lights also allow us to quantify changes in the size distribution and connectedness of different intensities of development. Over a wide range of brightnesses, the size distributions of spatially contiguous lighted area are consistent with power laws with exponents near -1 as predicted by Zipf's Law for cities. However, the larger lighted segments are much larger than individual cities  they correspond to vast spatial networks of contiguous development (Small et al., 2011). ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.";"Christopher Small,Christopher D.

"A complex network approach to urban growth";"7469381680014020146";"2006";"Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.";"A Hcllervik,C Andersson,K Frenken,"

We provide new empirical evidence by using the large data base ‘Geopolis’, which has strictly comparable figures for all towns and cities of the world over 10,000 inhabitants between 1950 and 1990. A Pareto model is used for identifying as metropolises one or a few large cities for each national urban system. From those data, two empirical power laws are established, linking the size of the metropolises to the size of their national urban system. The first is a transversal law: for a set of countries at a given date, the share of population concentrated in metropolises tends to decrease when larger countries are considered. The second law, which is longitudinal, shows that metropolises in the past have grown in a systematic way more rapidly than the rest of their urban system, invalidating Gibrat's urban growth model. Such empirical regularities could help for predicting the future of nowadays observed metropolisation trends.";"Fran??ois Moriconi-Ebrard,Denise Pumain,"
"An analytical process of the spatio-temporal evolution of urban systems based on allometric and fractal ideas";"7872429105606633777";"2009";"This paper presents a computer-based analytical framework for the spatio-temporal evolution of urban systems using the ideas from the allometric growth associated with fractals. Both cities as systems and systems of cities follow the law of allometric growth, and the scaling factors of the allometric relations can compose the matrix equations as eigenfunctions. The fractal dimension arrays are just the eigenvectors of the scaling factor matrices while the numbers of variables are the greatest eigenvalues. The solutions of matrix equations can be employed to analyse city systems and evaluate relative levels of urban development. The method is applied to Hangzhou urban system of China. The results reveal clearly an urbanization process characterized as population concentration and an industrialization process characterized as industrial diffusion. The computation results are consistent with the reality, which indicate that the method is available for analyzing the spatio-temporal evolution of complex systems such as cities. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

"Holonic multilevel simulation of complex systems: Application to real-time pedestrians simulation in virtual urban environment";"5434385889408708390";"2008";"Simulation, which creates abstractions of the system is an appropriate approach for studying complex systems that are inaccessible through direct observation and measurement. The problem with simulation of great numbers of interacting entities is that it is difficult to create a reliable and tractable abstraction of the real system. Indeed, simulating large numbers of entities requires great computing resources. A solution to avoid this problem is to use macroscopic models. However, this type of model may be unavailable or not reliable for the problem at hand and it does not allow the observation of individual behaviours. In this paper, a multilevel simulation model is proposed to allow the use of both microscopic and macroscopic techniques. This model is based upon Holonic Multi-Agent Systems which offer a promising approach for developing applications in complex domains characterised by a hierarchical structure. The proposed approach provides a generic scheduling model for multilevel simulations: dynamically adapting the level of simulated behaviours while being as faithful as possible to the simulated model. It does not only manage the level of entitiesâ€™ behaviour but also of behaviours classically assigned to the environmental part of a simulation. A set of physics-based indicators is also introduced to dynamically determine the most suitable level for each entity and to maintain the best trade-off between simulation accuracy and constraints (dependent on the model or the experimental context).";"StÃ©phane Galland,Vincent Hilaire,AbderrafiÃ¢a Koukam,Franck Gechter,Nicolas Gaud,"
"Theoretical principles in interurban simulation models: a comparison";"9275283361534313730";"2013";"Agent-based models are increasingly used by urban specialists, supplanting the simulation models using differential equations which were more popular earlier. These models already made reference to the theories of self-organisation and to mechanisms of evolution not so far from those used today to describe the emergence of macroscopic properties or structures in a bottom-up process from interactions operating at the microlevel. Moreover there is less difference than often suggested in the literature between the two forms of modelling - differential equations and multi-agent models - in the way they integrate principles of urban theory. To test this assumption, we compare models made of systems of differential equations (Allen's model firmly rooted in self-organisation theory and the model developed by Weidlich and Haag, affiliated to synergetic theory) with multi-agent models (SIMPOP family) designed to meet the same task: simulating the differentiated dynamics of urban entities over the medium to long term from their functional economic specialisation. We show that multi-agent systems are providing interesting solutions for the modelling method, because of their greater ability to simulate the emergence of geographical macrostructures from different levels of interaction.

"Urbanization of the United States over two centuries: an approach based on a long-term database (1790–2010)";"16880055277815233442";"2015";"This paper presents an original methodology for the construction of a\nharmonized database for urban areas in the United States from 1790 to\n2010 (a period with a census every 10years, amounting to 23 dates).\nUpstream, this method is based on a theoretical choice, the use of a\nspatio-temporal reference frame to construct urban areas over the long\nterm, defined by a maximum range of one hour's travel for each period.\nWe used an automatic aggregation from a Reilly model. Urban measures\n(growth, concentration) derived from this harmonized database are then\npresented, providing a unified picture of urbanization in the United\nStates over more than two centuries. They are compared with results\nderived from more classical databases established using the official\nfigures from the Census Bureau, or from other constructions differing\nfrom the present system. The results diverge considerably in some\ninstances, which confirms the impact of the method of delineation of\ngeographical areas in measures of growth.";"Helene Mathian,Gabriel Vatin,Anne Bretagnolle,Francois Delisle,"

The current paper considers this approach with respect to householder migration and dynamics of residential distribution. It begins with a characterization of different styles of AB modelling and proceeds with examples of AB models of residential behavior, ranging from Schelling-type abstract models to real-world simulations of the population dynamics of an urban region with a population of 30,000. The latter is investigated in depth.";"Erez Hatna,Itzhak Benenson,Itzhak Orner,"
"Spatial scaling of stable night lights";"4704068805408411744";"2011";"City size distributions, defined on the basis of population, are often described by power laws. Zipf's Law states that the exponent of the power law for rank-size distributions of cities is near ?1. Verification of power law scaling for city size distributions at continental and global scales is complicated by small sample sizes, inappropriate estimation techniques, inconsistent definitions of urban extent and variations in the accuracy and spatial resolution of census administrative units. We attempt to circumvent some of these complications by using a continuous spatial proxy for anthropogenic development and treat it as a spatial complement to population distribution. We quantify the linearity and exponent of the rank-size distribution of spatially contiguous patches of stable night light over a range of brightnesses corresponding to different intensities of development. Temporally stable night lights, as measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS), provide a unique proxy for anthropogenic development. Brightness and spatial extent of emitted light are correlated to population density (Sutton et al., 2001), built area density (Elvidge et al., 2007c) and economic activity (Doll et al., 2006  Henderson et al., 2009) at global scales and within specific countries. Using a variable brightness threshold to derive spatial extent of developed land area eliminates the complication of administrative definitions of urban extent and makes it possible to test Zipf's Law in the spatial dimension for a wide range of anthropogenic development. Higher brightness thresholds generally correspond to more intense development while lower thresholds extend the lighted area to include smaller settlements and less intensively developed peri-urban and agricultural areas. Using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate power law linearity and exponent of the resulting rank-size distributions across a range of upper tail cutoffs, we consistently find statistically significant exponents in the range ?0.95 to ?1.11 with an abrupt transition to very large, extensively connected, spatial networks of development near the low light detection limit of the sensor. This range of exponents and transition are observed at both continental and global scales. The results suggest that Zipf's Law also holds for spatial extent of anthropogenic development across a range of intensities at both continental and global scales. The implication is that the dynamics of urban growth and development may be represented as spatial phase transitions when the spatial extent and intensity of development are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete entities. ?? 2010.";"Deborah Balk,Mark Montgomery,Christopher Small,Christopher D.

"The constructal law in nature and society";"1288860354820438007";"2007";"Constructal Theory of Social Dynamics brings together for the first time social scientists and engineers to develop a predictive theory of social organization, as a conglomerate of mating flows that morph in time to flow more easily (people, goods, money, energy, information). These flows have objectives (e.g., minimization of effort, travel time, cost), and the objectives clash with global constraints (space, time, resources). The result is organization (flow architecture) derived from one principle of configuration evolution in time (the constructal law): for a flow system to persist in time, its configuration must morph such that it provides easier access to its streams. Constructal theory predicts animal design and geophysical flows, and makes evolution a part of physics. In the social sciences, there is substantial literature based on the use of optima to deduce social, population and economic dynamics. The constructal approach of this book links social sciences with physics, biology and engineering. The book explores the deterministic principle that generates a broad array of patterned phenomena, in demography, geography, communications, hierarchy, and multiple scales. Examples are the distribution of living settlements, the occurrence of flow structure inside each settlement, 'development' as the relation between fast-flowing societies and advancement and wealth, migration patterns, and globalization. Constructal Theory of Social Dynamics is novel and important because it puts the occurrence of social organization on a scientific basis. It brings social organization under the same physics principle that accounts for the generation of flow architecture (design) in geophysical flows, animal design, and engineered flows. This exploratory work adds a dose of determinism to the modeling and predicting of societal flows.";"Adrian Bejan,Gilbert W Merkx,"

"Lost in translation, found in entropy: An exploratory data analysis of latent growth factors in a Mediterranean city (1960–2010)";"9535392276237090000";"2015";"Relating urban form and functions for the various typologies of metropolitan regions is an intriguing area of research. Mediterranean cities offer a kaleidoscopic overview of different urban forms (dominated by compact and dense settlements) and functional patterns at the local scale. The present study introduces an exploratory analysis of the long-term expansion (1960-2010) of a paradigmatic Mediterranean city (Athens, Greece) suspended between informality and planning, competitiveness and crisis. Going beyond the classical models investigating urban growth in developed countries, 17 socioeconomic and territorial indicators were analyzed by decade for each municipality within the study area to identify latent factors characterizing the recent phases of urban expansion. Our results point out the increased complexity of growth patterns that are shifting from a strictly mono-centric spatial organization to a more entropic and scattered model based on the dichotomy between the compact city and the neighboring dispersed suburbs. The methodology applied offers a comprehensive overview of the relationship between form and functions underlying post-war Athens' development and contributes to the understanding of urban complexity in the contemporary city. © 2015.";"L Salvati,P Serra,A Mavrakis,M Carlucci,"
