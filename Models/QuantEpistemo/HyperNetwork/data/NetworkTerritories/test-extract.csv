"The adaptive efficiency of land use planning measured by the control of urban sprawl. The cases of the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland";"8635210426419881284";"2012";"The paper aims to position the concept of adaptive efficiency in planning theory, by providing insights on the conditions that explain why land use planning in some institutional contexts is able to adapt and improve more efficiently than in others. This is done by focusing on a specific planning goal: the control of residential sprawl. The paper presents a theoretical framework based on two models, one on the coordinating mechanisms regarding the use of land and one to explain institutional changes. This framework is exploited with empirical case studies where we compare the control of sprawl in the Netherlands, Belgium and Poland. The analysis diagnoses a duality of planning practices. Even though planning failures occur in the Netherlands as well, we provide evidence that Dutch land use planning has been able to efficiently adapt regulatory instruments and collaborative practices to societal changes. By contrast, Belgian and Polish planners face huge difficulties to incorporate new initiatives to control urban sprawl or, in more general terms, to reinforce their influence on land uses. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";"Szymon Marcinczak,Jean Marie Halleux,Erwin van der Krabben,"
"Conflict dynamics in coastal zones: a perspective using the example of Languedoc-Rousillon (France)";"11069562233855334382";"2009";"Abstract  Most rapidly changing areas are beset by intensified conflicts of use, where the environmental dimension plays an increasingly\r\nimportant role. These antagonistic situations represent a challenge for continuing and launching territorial public actions\r\nfor integrated resource management. This contribution aims to highlight the socio-spatial dynamics of conflicts of use relating\r\nto the environment and provides methodological elements to characterise the conflictual processes at work in rapidly changing\r\nareas. It sets out elements of research on the Languedoc-Roussillon coastal zone, based on the hypothesis that sustainable\r\nmanagement of territories’ gains by being acquainted with conflict mechanisms (the emergence factor, modes of dissent, methods\r\nof regulation) and the actors involved (role, organisation, strategies), in time and in space. An interpretative framework\r\nfor the conflictual processes relating to the environment is proposed, in order to provide a complementary analysis of the\r\ntypologies of existing conflicts.";"Anne Cadoret,"
" Failure and recovery in dynamical networks";"13211504423809975520";"2017";"Failure, damage spread and recovery crucially underlie many spatially embedded networked systems ranging from transportation structures to the human body. Here we study the interplay between spontaneous damage, induced failure and recovery in both embedded and non-embedded networks. In our model the network’s components follow three realistic processes that capture these features: (i) spontaneous failure of a component independent of the neighborhood (internal failure), (ii) failure induced by failed neighboring nodes (external failure) and (iii) spontaneous recovery of a component. We identify a metastable domain in the global network phase diagram spanned by the model’s control parameters where dramatic hysteresis effects and random switching between two coexisting states are observed. This dynamics depends on the characteristic link length of the embedded system. For the Euclidean lattice in particular, hysteresis and switching only occur in an extremely narrow region of the parameter space compared to random networks. We develop a unifying theory which links the dynamics of our model to contact processes. Our unifying framework may help to better understand controllability in spatially embedded and random networks where spontaneous recovery of components can mitigate spontaneous failure and damage spread in dynamical networks.";"S.

"Evaluating the impact of distance measures on deforestation simulations in the fluvial landscapes of Amazonia";"1573113413551134432";"2014";"Land use and land cover change (LUCC) models frequently employ different\naccessibility measures as a proxy for human influence on land change\nprocesses. Here, we simulate deforestation in Peruvian Amazonia and\nevaluate different accessibility measures as LUCC model inputs. We\ndemonstrate how the selection, and different combinations, of\naccessibility measures impact simulation results. Out of the individual\nmeasures, time distance to market center catches the essential aspects\nof accessibility in our study area. The most accurate simulation is\nachieved when time distance to market center is used in association with\ndistance to transport network and additional landscape variables.\nAlthough traditional Euclidean measures result in clearly lower\nsimulation accuracy when used separately, the combination of two\ncomplementary Euclidean measures enhances simulation accuracy\nsignificantly. Our results highlight the need for site and context\nsensitive selection of accessibility variables. More sophisticated\naccessibility measures can potentially improve LUCC models' spatial\naccuracy, which often remains low.";"Maria Salonen,Eduardo Eiji Maeda,Tuuli Toivonen,"
"An integrated evaluation method of accessibility, quality of life, and social interaction";"5902675255461632250";"2008";"Since accessibility is an essential factor in land-use and transport planning, several methods have been developed to evaluate it. Nevertheless, it has seldom been an essential part of performance measures for policy evaluation from the viewpoint of individuals' quality of life (QoL). The objective of this study is to develop an integrated evaluation method of accessibility, QoL, and social interaction which contributes to the evaluation of land-use and transport policies for livable and sustainable urban development. In this paper, based on quantification of the weights of multielements of QoL, we develop a QoL-based accessibility measure and a QoL performance measure to address appropriate policies of land-use transport coordination and integration by disentangling the mismatch between real urban structures and people's demand for QoL. Furthermore, we explore embryonic ideas for the development of a generalised framework of QoL evaluation, incorporating social interactions and institutional design which link the QoL concept with quality of space and quality of procedure.

"Improved modelling for urban sustainability assessment and strategic planning: local government planner and modeller perspectives on the key challenges";"5998035279811070766";"2014";"Abstract Many technical and modelling tools are available to support the strategic assessment of land-use and infrastructure policy proposals in local government. However, there remains a lack of guidance and general confusion as to how modelling may be integrated into the policy- and decision-making process or how to practically set up participatory model-building with practitioners. Although major advances have been made in modelling over recent decades, several unresolved implementation issues remain in practice. This paper provides the results of a panel survey, which explored what planners and modellers believe to be key modelling implementation issues, their perceived importance and a set of modelling requirements. The results suggest that planners generally feel that they do not understand models and the modelling process, and modellers, in turn, feel that they do not always understand policy development and decision-making. Problems regarding data preparation were viewed as the most important challenge. Ensuring leadership and management support and initiatives aimed at improving the communication and confidence of participants were perceived as key requirements. Limited resources, leadership support and a lack of education are some of the challenges that are perceived as important before planners and other government officers can take advantage of modelling.

"Happy or liberal? Making sense of behavior in transport policy design";"11575580900884874140";"2014";"Appropriate microeconomic foundations of mobility are decisive for successful policy design in transportation and, in particular, for the challenge of climate change mitigation. Recent research suggests that behavior in transportation cannot be adequately represented by the standard approach of revealed preferences. Moreover, mobility choices are influenced by factors widely regarded as normatively irrelevant. Here we draw on insights from behavioral economics, psychology and welfare theory to examine how transport users make mobility decisions and when it is desirable to modify them through policy interventions. First, we explore systematically which preferences, heuristics and decision processes are relevant for mobility-specific behavior, such as mode choice. We highlight the influence of infrastructure on the formation of travel preferences. Second, we argue that the behavioral account of decision-making requires policy-makers to take a position on whether transport policies should be justified by appealing to preference satisfaction or to raising subjective well-being. This distinction matters because of the (i) influence of infrastructure on preference formation, (ii) health benefits from non-motorized mobility, (iii) negative impact of commuting on happiness and (iv) status-seeking behavior of individuals. The orthodox approach of only internalizing externalities is insufficient because it does not allow for the evaluation of these effects. Instead, our analysis suggests that transport demand modeling should consider behavioral effects explicitly.";"Felix Creutzig,Linus Mattauch,Monica Ridgway,"
"Road project opportunity costs subject to a regional constraint on greenhouse gas emissions";"3721656126911183780";"2012";"France has constrained the Aquitaine region to set up a climate plan to avoid an emission of 2883 ktCO2eq for the period 2007-2013. In parallel, the region has decided to carry out the construction of road infrastructures in order to avoid very high congestion costs. Those road projects will involve an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during that period. In the present context of strong sustainability, all emissions (direct and indirect) generated by those projects should be offset. At the regional level, the offsetting of GHG emissions is usually carried out by implementing carbon sequestration projects or projects that reduce energy demand. This paper aims at determining the maximum budget for financing GHG emissions offsetting projects, with computation being based on the opportunity costs of projects, the minimum cost of economic activity reduction required to offset emissions from those projects. The maximum budget devoted to GHG emissions offsetting projects should not exceed ???2001 1920 M to ???2001 3592 M, according to low/high traffic growth assumptions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";"Jean Christophe Martin,Patrick Point,"
"Incorporating equity as part of the wider impacts in transport infrastructure assessment: an application of the SUMINI approach";"10846396702771213554";"2013";"The state of the art in appraisal of transport infrastructure (particularly for developed countries) is moving towards inclusivity of a set of wider impacts than has traditionally been the case. In appraisal frameworks generally Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), features as either an alternative to, or complementary with, Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) particularly when assessing a wider set of distributional and other impacts. In that respect it goes some way towards addressing an identified weakness in conventional CBA. This paper proposes a new method to incorporate the wider impacts into the appraisal framework (SUMINI) based upon a composite indicator and MCA. The method is illustrated for a particular example of the wider set of impacts, i.e. equity, through the ex-post assessment of two large EU transport infrastructure (TEN-T) case studies. The results suggest that SUMINI assesses equity impacts well and the case studies highlight the flexibility of the approach in reflecting different policy or project objectives. The research concludes that this method should not be viewed as being in competition with traditional CBA, but that it could be an easily adopted and complementary approach. The value in the research is in providing a new and significant methodological advance to the historically difficult question of how to evaluate equity and other wider impacts. The research is of strong international significance due to the publication of the TEN-Ts review by the European Commission, as well as the transnational nature of large scale interurban transport schemes, the involvement of national and transnational stakeholder groups in the approval and funding of those schemes, the large numbers of population potentially subject to equity and other wider impacts and the degree of variation in the regional objectives and priorities for transport decision makers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]";"Nikolaos Thomopoulos,Susan Grant-Muller,"
"Structural accessibility for mobility management";"5883133859893048314";"2013";"Urban mobility problems, such as congestion, have been threatening the quality of life and the competitiveness of urban areas as well as their sustainable development. The need to integrate land use and transport policies has been widely recognised as an important approach within the 'predict and prevent' paradigm for mobility management. Nevertheless, such integration is seldom put into practice. The lack of design support tools is pointed out as one of the reasons for this fact. The accessibility concept is believed to provide a useful framework to support the design of integrated land use and transport policies. This paper hypothesises that measures of comparative accessibility by transport mode can operationalise the accessibility concept for this purpose. In order to test this hypothesis, a design support tool was developed, based on a measure of comparative accessibility - the Structural Accessibility Layer (SAL). The usefulness of the tool, and thereby of comparative accessibility, was tested. First, the SAL is applied to a case study - Greater Oporto - and then evaluated through expert interviews. The case study provides insight into its potentials as design support tool for integrated land use and transport policies. Expert interviews enable the assessment of the robustness, usefulness and applicability of the tool. The results suggest that the SAL provides a useful operational form of the accessibility concept for design support. This research concludes that measures of structural accessibility seem to provide a useful design support framework for integrated land use and transport policy, shedding light on the sustainability of potential mobility enabled by land use and transport conditions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";"Cecília Silva,"
