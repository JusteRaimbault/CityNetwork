"Archaeological simulation and the testing paradigm";"5615343318727502473";"2016";"Simulations in archaeological research make use of a wide range of techniques and methods. As a general rule they tend toward early adoption of new computational approaches (such as agent-based modelling and multi-agent simulation), evaluative statistical tools (such as sensitivity or uncertainty analyses), and borrow heavily from similar applications in other disciplines; particularly ones that emphasise the dynamic (or dynamical) group behaviour of biological organisms. As these approaches become more sophisticated our theoretical bases for testing, and ultimately refuting or validating their implications are falling behind. Largely this is due to the nature of the assumptions we make about the testing of archaeological hypotheses in general, and our expectations about causality, not merely the over-simplification of past human decision-making by the simulations themselves. We have very sophisticated computational devices for simulating the past in many unique and interesting ways, but there are some basic underlying issues that clearly indicate the problems with archaeological simulation are primarily theoretical and not mathematical.

"Archaeologies of the Past and in the Present in 2014: Materialities of Human History";"3975435873443740171";"2015";"Research from the past year demonstrates archaeologists’ diverse contributions to the anthropological study of human experience and social relationships in time and space. I divide literature published from late 2013 to late 2014 into five themes. First, archaeological research on space focuses on the persistence and materiality of landscapes, the creation and dynamics of communities and cities, and the mobility and migration of people. Second, studies of climate change and environmental interaction stress that organizational relationships and their long-term legacies are fundamental to ecological sustainability. Third, archaeologists offer anthropology the ability to contextualize the causes and the manifestations of violence and conflict through longitudinal cases studies and material analysis. Fourth, work on objects, bodies, and identity emphasizes that social subjectivities are not only variable but are historically connected to material worlds. Finally, fifth, archaeologists engaged with the present offer critical understandings of heritage policies and promote an activism that seeks more ethical practices with descendent communities and within the discipline itself. Despite differences, the recent literature reveals archaeologists’ contributions to these significant anthropological topics by studying long-term, historical legacies and the materiality of human relationships.

"Archaeology for the Anthropocene: Scale, soil, and the settlement of Iceland";"3847995241103061470";"2016";"Archaeologists have devised numerous methods for measuring and describing past human-environmental interactions, but connecting historic case studies with present-day global concerns often proves challenging. New ways of considering scale are needed to bring case studies of past communities into productive conversation with the global Anthropocene. Iceland, one of the last land masses colonized by humans, was transformed by the agricultural practices of the first generations of Norse settlers in the 9th and 10th centuries, including a significant reduction in forest cover and soil loss to erosion. However, the large-scale, island-wide process of erosion manifested in different ways that become clear when changes in soil cover are investigated at the regional scale. These changes were beneficial in some places and detrimental in others, and the development of inequality was contingent on both social and environmental contexts. Scholars of the contemporary Anthropocene must likewise connect local effects, including landscape degradation and social inequality, to anthropogenic processes that operate beyond the scale of everyday experience. Social landscapes, including infrastructure and environmental degradation, act in concert with ecological processes to reconstitute the ???natural??? into new, taken-for-granted landscapes of inequality. Studying the way past communities experienced relatively larger-scale anthropogenic environmental change leads to new ways of thinking about, and perhaps managing, human responses to contemporary global-scale change.";"Kathryn A.

"A hybrid network/grid model of urban morphogenesis and optimization";"3559635412259202692";"2014";"We describe a hybrid agent-based model and simulation of urban morphogenesis. It consists of a cellular automata grid coupled to a dynamic network topology. The inherently heterogeneous properties of urban structure and function are taken into account in the dynamics of the system. We propose various layout and performance measures to categorize and explore the generated configurations. An economic evaluation metric was also designed using the sensitivity of segregation models to spatial configuration. Our model is applied to a real-world case, offering a means to optimize the distribution of activities in a zoning context.";"R Doursat,A Banos,J Raimbault,"
" Effects of the Wine Cooperative System on Socio-economic Factors and Landscapes in Mountain Areas";"11795818425523978818";"2015";"n France, cooperatives produce 41% of the wine.1 Yet, all French regions have not adopted cooperative organization to the same extent (Touzard et al. 2008). It has been observed, for example, that the French departments with considerable orographic conditions (Alpine departments, the Pyrenees, the Rhone Valley) widely use cooperative organization (Fig. 1). This article thus focuses on this type of mountain territory. While the literature on cooperative systems and especially wine cooperatives is abundant, covering economic (Piesse et al. 2005; Pitcher, 2012), sociological (Ewert, 2005; Chiffoleau et al. 2012), and geographic aspects (Schirmer, 2007; Touzard, 2010, Touzard et al., 2010), here we address the issues raised by a multi-agent system (MAS) (Banos, 2013). This type of approach makes it possible to explore and understand the complex interactions at work between societies and their territories, while starting from individual behavior (Bousquet and Le Page, 2004; Gilbert and Troitzsch, 2005). Using a MAS also enables an interdisciplinary approach, linking geography, economy, and local";"Etienne Delay,Eric Rouvellac,Fabio Zottele,Marius Chevallier,"
"15 Transforming Lessons from the Past into Lessons for the Future";"5437347260529679560";"2014";"This paper argues that we would massively increase the value of our archaeological understanding of the past for the present if we cast it differently. Rather than use a reductionist, ex-post approach (which explains the present by invoking the past, looking for origins), we should be using an “ex ante” approach that looks at the emergence of change, linking past and present to the future. This would allow us to learn from the past for the future. The paper examines some of the difficulties encountered in implementing such a different approach, at the level of our cognition, our scientific practices, and our paradigms, and then illustrates some of the changes in perspective such a shift would bring about by referring to the different discussions of Maya archaeology presented in this volume.";"Sander E. van der Leeuw,"
