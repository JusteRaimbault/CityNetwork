"The land-use impacts of urban rail transit systems";"14078813764339021668";"1996";"This article reviews research regarding the impacts of urban rail transit systems on real estate development in the United States and Canada. Transit played an instrumental role in urban expansion during the nineteenth century. More recently, rail transit has also often influenced urban development, but in conjunction with favorable zoning, attractive sites, and a strong market for development. Numerous examples of station-area projects can be found in San Francisco, Toronto, and Washington, D.C. In several cities, land near transit stations has realized rent premiums. The effects of rail transit on development, independent of zoning and other factors, are not readily identified. Most research has not examined specific real estate projects from the developer's perspective. It is not clear whether rail transit is the most cost-effective means of directing development, but if rail transit is built, then station-area development should be encouraged to enhance the returns on the investment.";"Herman Huang,"
"Transportation implications of metropolitan spatial planning in mega-city Beijing";"16645999085681599203";"2009";"In the mega-cities of developing countries, access to workplaces has become increasingly difficult due to dramatic rises in commuting times, reflecting both limited transport infrastructure and particular forms of metropolitan spatial planning. In the light of this, this article examines the impact of spatial planning on workers' commuting time, using the case of Beijing. The analysis, using travel data collected from 613 households in 2006, shows that workers' commuting time has a statistically significant relationship with location variables related to spatial planning, when socio-economic factors and transport provision are controlled for. Self-contained and high-density development as well as compact land use in the peripheral constellations could play a positive role in shortening workers' commuting times. At the same time, longer commuting times will result from illegal and dispersed development in green belts and outer suburban areas. The results suggest that better metropolitan spatial planning would be one efficient way of containing the dramatic growth of commuting times and congestion in central Beijing, particularly where local government has limited financial capacity to produce transport infrastructure in the context of a growing urban population. © Liverpool University Press 2009.";"B Lü,P Zhao,"
"Cities and highway networks in Europe";"8195558924340493347";"1996";"The highway system - a communications network on a national or international scale par excellence - is here examined in light of the relationships which it makes possible between cities (or poles) of European significance. The 'rank' of each of these cities, in terms of accessibility to the other poles, can be calculated mathematically and a hierarchy of these cities can thus be established. While the position of a given city within this hierarchy is linked to physical and human geography (natural barriers in the first case  boundary effects, extremely variable density according to country and region in the second), it is also linked to the characterics (especially topological) of the national highway systems.

" Injecting a rapid rail link into a metropolis";"15543094506723780834";"2009";"The Gautrain Project being developed in the Gauteng province of South Africa is currently the largest construction project on the African continent. At an estimated cost of some US$3000 million, it surpasses any previous single project in South Africa, and will result in a vital rapid rail link between Johannesburg, Pretoria and Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport. The total route length of 80 km will comprise some 15 km in tunnels in Johannesburg, about 10.5 km on viaducts along various sections of the route, and the balance on the surface or in shallow open cuts. The Gautrain is being developed by the Gauteng Provincial Government through a Public Private Partnership concession contract with an international consortium of major players in the construction, public transport vehicle manufacturing and operations fields. While construction will take place over a period of some four years to 2011, the Concessionaire will operate the full system for a further 15 years, after which the Province will assume the responsibility. With ten stations being built along the route, some in virtual green field surroundings and others in high density urban areas, and some deep underground and others using air rights above ground, profound land use challenges and opportunities arise. Superimposing a rapid rail artery of this magnitude onto the urban landscape of three metropolitan areas is bound to have considerable environmental and land use impacts. This paper demonstrates, at a critical stage in the civil construction programme, how these impacts are being addressed and how the natural and built environment is being considered and perhaps even enhanced, rather than being adversely affected. © 2009 WIT Press.";"J.

"Transit-oriented development in San Diego County: The incremental implementation of a planning idea";"2711632327760691846";"1999";"Although transit-oriented development (TOD) has become an increasingly\npopular planning idea, very few studies have examined how localities\nplan for and implement transit-oriented projects. This article helps\nfill that gap by studying the TOD implementation process near stations\non the oldest of the current generation of light rail lines in the\nUnited States-the San Diego Trolley. Some parts of the San Diego Trolley\nhave been in operation since 1981, but there are still only a few\nprojects that both incorporate TOD concepts and were built after\nplanning for the nearby rail line began. TOD projects were pursued most\naggressively in the City of La Mesa, largely because TOD was consistent\nwith local goals that went beyond transportation. Elsewhere in the San\nDiego region  several barriers have limited TOD implementation. Overall,\nthe cities along trolley routes, though sympathetic to regional rail\nobjectives, have approached TOD from a perspective of local goals,\nopportunities, and constraints. The result is that regional TOD\nimplementation resembles the incremental model of policy-making. One\nimplication of the San Diego experience is that incorporating TOD\nconcepts into station-area developments is likely to be a slow process.";"N S Compin,M G Boarnet,"
"Analysis of the impact of high-speed railroad service on air transport demand";"2741168611238703427";"2006";"There has recently been a rather large reduction of between 34% and 75% in domestic aviation demand in Korea. The two primary causes were the introduction of several new highway services and the fact that Korea Train Express (KTX) began operating a route between Seoul and Daegu in April 2004. This study analyzes the effects on air traffic demand in terms of the impact of the opening of KTX by applying the Stated Preference (SP) survey method. The survey was conducted 8 months prior to the opening of the KTX. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"Yonghwa Park,Hun Koo Ha,"
" Developing a sustainability assessment model: the sustainable infrastructure, land-use, environment and transport model";"10547017315451312407";"2010";"Measuring the comparative sustainability levels of cities, regions, institutions and projects is an essential procedure in creating sustainable urban futures. This paper introduces a new urban sustainability assessment model: “The Sustainable Infrastructure, Land-use, Environment and Transport Model (SILENT)”. The SILENT Model is an advanced geographic information system and indicator-based comparative urban sustainability indexing model. The model aims to assist planners and policy makers in their daily tasks in sustainable urban planning and development by providing an integrated sustainability assessment framework. The paper gives an overview of the conceptual framework and components of the model and discusses the theoretical constructs, methodological procedures, and future development of this promising urban sustainability assessment model.";"Fatih Dur,Tan Yigitcanlar,"
"An integrated model of facility location and transportation network design";"13527409584934730161";"2001";"Network location models have been used extensively for siting public and private facilities. In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions. We conclude by identifying promising research directions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.";"M.S. Daskin,S. Melkote,"
"Calibration of an integrated land-use and transportation model using maximum-likelihood estimation";"9299535133961645220";"2014";"The focus of this work is calibration of the land-use module of an integrated land-use and transportation model (ILUTM). The calibration task involves estimating key parameters that dictate the output of the land-use module. Hence, an algorithm based on maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) is developed for calibration. Furthermore, the observed values of the outputs from the land-use module are assumed to admit a Gaussian error. The ILUTM methodology used here is TRANUS which is used to model the city of Grenoble in France. The aforementioned algorithm is then applied to calibrate the land-use module of the Grenoble model. The covariance of the Gaussian error term is assumed to be unknown. It is represented as a function of the land-use module inputs and hyperparameters.â' The resulting MLE optimization problem has 111 parameters to be estimated, 90 of which are land use parameters and 21 are hyperparameters of the Gaussian covariance kernel. The performance of the proposed calibration methodology is then compared to the traditional calibration techniques used for land use and transportation models, when applied to the Grenoble land-use model. It is observed that the proposed method outperforms the traditional technique when compared based upon a given quantity of interest.

Transport growth is essentially for economic growth but is not without negative impacts. External effects such as pollution, congestion, accidents and damage to infrastructure generate considerable social costs that impose a heavy burden on society. This title addresses the need to develop new freight transport models and scientific tools to provide sound solutions that consider the wide range of internal and external impacts. The international contributions push forward frontiers in freight transport modelling and analysis.";"Advance Program,Andre Tok,Ozlem Yanmaz-tuzel,Herbert S.

"Roads, land use, and deforestation: a spatial model applied to Belize";"10120413830864362824";"1996";"Rural roads promote economic development, but they also facilitate deforestation. To explore this tradeoff this article develops a spatially explicit model of land use and estimates probabilities of alternative land uses as a function of land characteristics and distance to market using a multinomial legit specification of this model. Controls are incorporated for the endogeneity of road placement. The model is applied to data for southern Belize, an area experiencing rapid expansion of both subsistence and commercial agriculture, using geographic information system (GIS) techniques to select sample points at 1-kilometer intervals. Market access, land quality, and tenure status affect the probability of agricultural land use synergistically, having differential effects on the likelihood of commercial versus semisubsistence farming. The results suggest that road building in areas with agriculturally poor soils and low population densities may be a ''lose-lose'' proposition, causing habitat fragmentation and providing low economic returns.";"10.

" Elementary processes governing the evolution of road networks";"3086518878428601412";"2012";"Urbanisation is a fundamental phenomenon whose quantitative characterisation is still inadequate. We report here the empirical analysis of a unique data set regarding almost 200 years of evolution of the road network in a large area located north of Milan (Italy). We find that urbanisation is characterised by the homogenisation of cell shapes, and by the stability throughout time of high-centrality roads which constitute the backbone of the urban structure, confirming the importance of historical paths. We show quantitatively that the growth of the network is governed by two elementary processes: (i) 'densification', corresponding to an increase in the local density of roads around existing urban centres and (ii) 'exploration', whereby new roads trigger the spatial evolution of the urbanisation front. The empirical identification of such simple elementary mechanisms suggests the existence of general, simple properties of urbanisation and opens new directions for its modelling and quantitative description.";"Emanuele Strano,Vincenzo Nicosia,Sergio Porta,Vito Latora,Marc Barthélemy,"
" A model of road network and buildings extension co-evolution";"14739715137994834697";"2014";"Urban morphology tries to understand the spatial structure of cities. It searches to identify the patterns and underlying substructures but also the process of city development. Our contribution follows this last direction, we model the co-evolution of the road network and the buildings. Our goal is triple: to combine cellular automata simplicity with city irregularities, to enable the road network and buildings co-evolution and to respect temporal coherence. These objectives lead us to propose a simulation model based on a geographic automata system. Several kinds of models already exist, but they usually concentrate only on the evolution of the road network or only on the population density. The originality of our work consists in the dynamic of co-evolution of the city, we propose a city morphogenesis model. ?? 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.";"Damien Olivier,Merwan Achibet,Antoine Dutot,Stefan Balev,"
"Network design and transportation planning: Models and algorithms";"13527193772942453318";"1984";"Numerous transportation applications as diverse as capital investment decision-making, vehicle fleet planning, and traffic light signal setting all involve some form of (discrete choice) network design. In this paper, we review some of the uses and limitations of integer programming-based approaches to network design, and describe several discrete and continuous choice models and algorithms. Our objectives are threefold-to provide a unifying view for synthesizing many network design models, to propose a unifying framework for deriving many network design algorithms, and to summarize computational experience in solving design problems. We also show that many of the most celebrated combinatorial problems that arise in transportation planning are specializations and variations of a generic design model. Consequently, the network design concepts described in this paper have great potential application in a wide range of problem settings.";"Richard T. Wong,Thomas L. Magnanti,"
" Evaluating transit-oriented development using a sustainability framework: Lessons from Perth's network city";"1874975002961414310";"2009";"Planners and urban designers across the globe are promoting transit-oriented development (TOD) to encourage sustainable precincts around public transport stations. TODs are compact, mixed-use developments that facilitate walking, bicycling, and use of public transport through its urban design. This chapter presents a method to evaluate the sustainability of TODs based on six aspects of outcomes, including 1. Travel Behaviour, 2. The Local Economy, 3. The Natural Environment, 4. The Built Environ-ment, 5. The Social Environment, and 6. The Policy Context. Data were collected in five rail precincts across Perth, Western Australia. The major goal of the study was to determine which indicators were possible to col-lect and establish baseline data.";"John L. Renne,"
"Chinese edition of transit-oriented development";"14424316244410372379";"2008";"Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a strategy to integrate transit and land use by focusing development around a transit station. Its principles are gaining increasing popularity worldwide in the global effort toward sustainable transportation. This paper attempts to answer two questions: Why do Chinese cities need TOD? How can TOD principles developed in the U.S. context be put into operation in urban China? The paper first introduces factors motivating communities in the United States to pursue TOD. Trends in China's urban expansion and travel growth are then reviewed, with a case made for TOD in the Chinese setting with the use of integrated land use-transit development. Next, the paper presents an operational TOD model derived from the experience of developing around transit in Hong Kong, Taipei, and mainland Chinese cities. The model is characterized as five D's squared, or 5D2, which includes differentiated density, dockized district, delicate design, diverse destination, and distributed dividends. It is emphasized that for sustainable transit, TOD should be applied as a composite policy combining land use, transportation, and transit finance.";"Ming Zhang,"
"Viewpoint: Toward a new generation of land use transport interaction models";"15723813718667706986";"2015";"Land use transport interaction (LUTI) models are often developed to model the interaction between the land use and transport systems for relatively large-scale spatial developments, like new residential or office areas, new main roads, or railway lines. In this paper I argue that we need a next generation of LUTI models that model trends such as peak car  decline in population, shops, services, etc.  impact of information and communications technology (ICT) on activity patterns and travel  and cycling policies. The current generation of LUTI models cannot adequately answer the policy questions raised by these trends. However, a major problem is that the future of these trends is uncertain, and we lack empirical research into the dynamics between these trends and their wider impact on land use and transport systems. Nevertheless, LUTI models can, by utilizing what-if calculations, help explore future trends and their implications. Other challenges for LUTI models include the calculation of a wider set of accessibility indicators, the inclusion of interactions between key actors in the transport and land-use system-serious gaming may prove a useful way to explore these interactions-and the development of dynamic visualizations.";"Bert van Wee,"
"A GIS-based planning approach to locating urban rail terminals";"9922981368373927992";"2001";"This paper develops a flexible GIS-based methodology for evaluating the potential locations of terminal park-and-ride facilities along urban rail lines. The methodology differs from political-based approaches and traditional travel demand modeling in its use of an objective measure of accessibility to gage the suitability of a site. The methodology begins by con- structing an index of derived demand for rail usage based on the local demographics. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used as a means of constructing an index of derived demand consistent with other passenger surveys. Next, trade areas or commutersheds are calculated for each candidate park-and-ride location based on realistic measures of accessibility and network based drive times, taking into account competition among candidates for riders. Following the analysis, the candidate locations and their commutersheds are delineated and visualized in the GIS environment. In summary, application of this method produces a site-specific suitability index that may be used to rank and compare potential park-and-ride locations. We illustrate how our approach fits within the context of the larger-scale corridor study as a complimentary means of refining the location of urban rail stations. The analysis uses the proposed rail system for Columbus Ohio as a case study.";"M. W. Horner,T. H. Grubesic,"
"Calibrating the Naples land-use and transport model";"4797711363877193555";"1994";"The calibration of a land-use and transport model of the Naples metropolitan area in Italy is described. The model is based on the MEPLAN general spatial interaction modelling framework that has arisen from initial efforts at The Martin Centre for Architectural and Urban Studies, University of Cambridge. A variety of parameter estimation methods were employed in the calibration effort. This included use of a process for identifying efficient parameter estimates in nested logit models, automated search routines for identifying values for the coefficients in multidimensional allocation formulae, cluster analysis procedures for developing zoning systems and category definitions, and various forms of log?linear multiple regression techniques. A complex manual procedure was developed whereby this set of methods was applied in a series of successive iterations. These iterations were designed to close in systematically on a model form and set of parameter values that would reproduce observed data that concerned the spatial distribution of different categories of employment and household, various economic interactions between these categories, and trips by person and vehicle on the transport network. The results demonstrate that the process can be used to slowly but surely establish an accurate model fit. This drawing together and practical application of the results of several areas of research has provided valuable experience and insight applicable to future such efforts.";"J D Hunt,"
"Accessibility evaluation of land-use and transport strategies: review and research directions";"14903997275377177864";"2004";"A review of accessibility measures is presented for assessing the usability of these measures in evaluations of land-use and transport strategies and developments. Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial-temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

"Territorial cohesion impacts of high-speed rail under different zoning systems";"1194486642962524679";"2014";"Large-scale transport infrastructure projects such as high-speed rail (HSR) produce significant effects on the spatial distribution of accessibility. These effects, commonly known as territorial cohesion effects, are receiving increasing attention in the research literature. However, there is little empirical research into the sensitivity of these cohesion results to methodological issues such as the definition of the limits of the study area or the zoning system. In a previous paper (Ortega et al., 2012), we investigated the influence of scale issues, comparing the cohesion results obtained at four different planning levels. This paper makes an additional contribution to our research with the investigation of the influence of zoning issues. We analyze the extent to which changes in the size of the units of analysis influence the measurement of spatial inequalities.The methodology is tested by application to the Galician (north-western) HSR corridor, with a length of nearly 670. km, included in the Spanish PEIT (Strategic Transport and Infrastructure Plan) 2005-2020. We calculated the accessibility indicators for the Galician HSR corridor and assessed their corresponding territorial distribution. We used five alternative zoning systems depending on the method of data representation used (vector or raster), and the level of detail (cartographic accuracy or cell size). Our results suggest that the choice between a vector-based and raster-based system has important implications. The vector system produces a higher mean accessibility value and a more polarized accessibility distribution than raster systems. The increased pixel size of raster-based systems tends to give rise to higher mean accessibility values and a more balanced accessibility distribution. Our findings strongly encourage spatial analysts to acknowledge that the results of their analyses may vary widely according to the definition of the units of analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.";"Andrés Monzón,Elena López,Emilio Ortega,"

"Evaluating transport externalities of urban growth: a critical review of scenario-based planning methods";"11057429637195491539";"2017";"Urban growth is an important phenomenon, which is taking place on an unprecedented scale, and its impacts on society and the environment are evident. In theory, an evaluation of such urban growth through sce-nario-based planning helps planners to better assess the future impacts of growth and develop better policies and plans. Within this context, the assessment of transport impacts is particularly important as transport plays an important role in shaping urban growth. Additionally, transport sector alone is responsible for about one-third of the greenhouse gas emissions of cities, which has detri-mental effects on the environment, economy, community health, and quality of life. In practice, however, scarce evidence exists outlining the challenges of scenario-based evaluation and how to best address these while modelling the transport impacts of various urban growth scenarios. This research addresses these gaps in the literature and assesses the effectiveness of scenario-based planning methods that are used for modelling the transport impacts of alternative urban growth scenarios. The methodological approach of the study consists of a critical review of the key literature and relevant methods that are commonly used to assess transport impacts. The results of this analysis highlight limitations of existing methods for effectively evaluating transport externalities of urban growth scenar-ios. The findings suggest that among many reviewed models, the ILUTE, URBANSIM and TRANUS simula-tion models are identified as significant ones. However, due to various limitations of the former two, TRANUS is noted as the most suitable one for evaluating the transport impacts of urban growth scenarios.";"T. Yigitcanlar,J.

"Spatiotemporal urbanization processes in the megacity of Mumbai, India: A Markov chains-cellular automata urban growth model";"5526883927689977429";"2013";"Several factors contribute to on-going challenges of spatial planning and urban policy in megacities, including rapid population shifts, less organized urban areas, and a lack of data with which to monitor urban growth and land use change. To support Mumbai's sustainable development, this research was conducted to examine past urban land use changes on the basis of remote sensing data collected between 1973 and 2010. An integrated Markov Chains-Cellular Automata (MC-CA) urban growth model was implemented to predict the city's expansion for the years 2020-2030. To consider the factors affecting urban growth, the MC-CA model was also connected to multi-criteria evaluation to generate transition probability maps. The results of the multi-temporal change detection show that the highest urban growth rates, 142% occurred between 1973 and 1990. In contrast, the growth rates decreased to 40% between 1990 and 2001 and decreased to 38% between 2001 and 2010. The areas most affected by this degradation were open land and croplands. The MC-CA model predicts that this trend will continue in the future. Compared to the reference year, 2010, increases in built-up areas of 26% by 2020 and 12% by 2030 are forecast. Strong evidence is provided for complex future urban growth, characterized by a mixture of growth patterns. The most pronounced of these is urban expansion toward the north along the main traffic infrastructure, linking the two currently non-affiliated main settlement ribbons. Additionally, urban infill developments are expected to emerge in the eastern areas, and these developments are expected to increase urban pressure. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.";"Marco Helbich,Hossein Shafizadeh Moghadam,"

"The impact of transit-oriented development on housing prices in San Diego, CA";"3443722888458689953";"2011";"This research measures the influence of transit-oriented development (TOD) on the San Diego, CA, condominium market. Many view TOD as a key element in creating a less auto dependent and more sustainable transport system. Price premiums indicate a potential for a market-driven expansion of TOD inventory. A hedonic price model is estimated to isolate statistically the effect of TOD. This includes interaction terms between station distance and various measures of pedestrian orientation. The resulting model shows that station proximity has a significantly stronger impact when coupled with a pedestrian-oriented environment. Conversely, station area condominiums in more auto-oriented environments may sell at a discount. This indicates that TOD has a synergistic value greater than the sum of its parts. It also implies a healthy demand for more TOD housing in San Diego.";"Michael Duncan,"
"Development of a temporal and spatial linkage between transit demand and land-use patterns";"8612868363866879140";"2013";"We are exploring ways to capture the temporal and spatial dimensions of the use of public transit. Specifically, we are investigating how different land uses affect the spatial and temporal demand for public transit services. Spatially, the availability of new data collection technology in public transit allows us to examine transit demand at the individual stop level. Our hypothesis, however, is that transit users' activity may not be originated from or destined to an individual stop per se  rather, the activity is associated with a specific location in the vicinity of the stop, and this location may be covered by several adjacent transit stops. More importantly, understanding the transit demand at this aggregate level (an aggregate catchment area) can enhance the ability to define a specific land-use type and the temporal characteristics related to passengers' activities. Temporally, we seek to understand the relationship between the demand for public transit service at specific times of the day and the associated land uses that may strongly influence the timing of that demand. To explore these dimensions, this study: 1) proposes a method of stop aggregation  2) generates transit service areas based on these aggregated stops  3) develops a set of metrics to better represent land-use types within these service areas  and 4) examines the spatial and temporal characteristics of transit demand for these service areas. These methods are applied to a case study using land-use and transit demand data from the Minneapolis–St. Paul metropolitan area.";"Daoqin Tong,Mark Hickman,Sanggu Lee,"
" Transport link scanner: simulating geographic transport network expansion through individual investments";"4395795512842304969";"2016";"This paper introduces a GIS-based model that simulates the geographic expansion of transport networks by several decision-makers with varying objectives. The model progressively adds extensions to a growing network by choosing the most attractive investments from a limited choice set. Attractiveness is defined as a function of variables in which revenue and broader societal benefits may play a role and can be based on empirically underpinned parameters that may differ according to private or public interests. The choice set is selected from an exhaustive set of links and presumably contains those investment options that best meet private operator’s objectives by balancing the revenues of additional fare against construction costs. The investment options consist of geographically plausible routes with potential detours. These routes are generated using a fine-meshed regularly latticed network and shortest path finding methods. Additionally, two indicators of the geographic accuracy of the simulated networks are introduced. A historical case study is presented to demonstrate the model’s first results. These results show that the modelled networks reproduce relevant results of the historically built network with reasonable accuracy.";"C. C. Koopmans,C. Jacobs-Crisioni,"

Through scenario analysis they can help to identify near-future critical locations in the face of environmental change. A dynamic, spatially explicit, land-use change model is presented for the regional scale: CLUE-S. The model is specifically developed for the analysis of land use in small regions (e.g., a watershed or province) at a fine spatial resolution. The model structure is based on systems theory to allow the integrated analysis of land-use change in relation to socio-economic and biophysical driving factors. The model explicitly addresses the hierarchical organization of land use systems, spatial connectivity between locations and stability. Stability is incorporated by a set of variables that define the relative elasticity of the actual land-use type to conversion. The user can specify these settings based on expert knowledge or survey data. Two applications of the model in the Philippines and Malaysia are used to illustrate the functioning of the model and its validation.";"Mark A. Friedl,Xiaoyang Zhang,Crystal B. Schaaf,"

In the suggested model, two kinds of economic agents are considered. On the one hand, the government makes the investment decision for the traffic network improvement based on the current traffic condition under the limited budget. On the other hand, households and companies will choose their locations according to the attraction of each traffic zone related to the road network accessibility and the housing price. Therefore, the land use is indicated by the population and employment distributions through the evolution process. Besides, the improvement of road capacity is modeled by a general bi-level programming of traffic network design. Simulation experiments show that the city will be more efficient and will have higher average accessibility for employment and population in the evolution process.";"J. Wu,Z. Gao,T. Li,H. Sun,"

The model uses four main criteria: (1) rail-related, (2) passenger services, (3) architecture and urbanism, and (4) economics. In addition, there are 26 subcriteria as well as five (potential) candidates or alternatives. Comparison matrices are used to obtain the local weights and priorities of the railway-station candidates. A DEA model is proposed to determine the optimum site for a railway station. It is shown that the local priorities (or weights) obtained from the AHP can be defined as the multiple outputs of a DEA model for finding the best site for a railway station. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In suburbs, just 7.5 percent of people live in poverty. The income elasticity of demand for land is too low for urban poverty to come from wealthy individuals' wanting to live where land is cheap (the traditional explanation of urban poverty). A significant income elasticity for land exists only because the rich eschew apartment living, and that elasticity is still too low to explain the poor's urbanization. The urbanization of poverty comes mainly from better access to public transportation in central cities. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";"Edward L. Glaeser,Jordan Rappaport,Matthew E.

If the ability of tourists to travel to preferred destinations is inhibited by inefficiencies in the transport system there is some likelihood that they will seek alternative destinations. This paper outlines a transport cost model that identifies the significance of transport as a factor in destination development as well as in the selection of destinations by intending tourists. The model demonstrates the dynamic relationship between categories of holiday expenditure and tourists' point of origin. Increased distance generally leads to increased transport access costs and represents a significant factor in total holiday cost. The model is tested by analyzing the role of transport in the development of Cairns as a destination by examining the effect of distance, transport access costs and competing destinations.";"Bruce Prideaux,"

"Impact of proximity to light rail rapid transit on station-area property values in Buffalo, New York";"2184418343986277380";"2007";"This study assesses the impact of proximity to light rail transit stations on residential property values in Buffalo, New York, where light rail has been in service for 20 years, but population is declining and ridership is decreasing. Hedonic models are constructed of assessed value for residential properties within half a mile of 14 light rail stations and independent variables are included that describe property characteristics, neighbourhood characteristics and locational amenities. The model suggests that, for homes located in the study area, every foot closer to a light rail station increases average property values by $2.31 (using geographical straight-line distance) and $0.99 (using network distance). Consequently, a home located within one-quarter of a mile radius of a light rail station can earn a premium of $1300-3000, or 2-5 per cent of the city's median home value. Model results further suggest that three independent variables-the number of bathrooms, size of the parcel and location on the East side or West side of Buffalo-are more influential than rail proximity in predicting property values. Individual regression models for each of the light rail system's 14 stations suggest that effects are not felt evenly throughout the system. Proximity effects are positive in high-income station areas and negative in low-income station areas. An analysis of the actual walking distance to stations (along the street network) versus the perceived proximity to stations (measured by straight-line distance) reveals that the results are statistically more significant in the network distance than the straight-line distance model, but the effects are greater in the straight-line distance model, which suggests that apparent proximity to rail stations is an added locational advantage compared with physical walking distance to the station.";"Daniel Baldwin Hess,Tangerine Maria Almeida,"

"Measuring territorial cohesion impacts of High-Speed Rail at different planning levels";"11015756863966592631";"2011";"The assessment of the impacts of high-speed rail (HSR) projects on territorial cohesion has recently emerged as an important issue for transport planners. HSR networks are usually designed to interconnect strong economic centers efficiently. Hence, the greatest improvements in accessibility concentrate near HSR stations, whereas intermediate locations suffer from comparatively lower accessibility benefits. Negative territorial cohesion impacts appear if HSR ultimately results in a more polarized spatial distribution of accessibility levels. There has so far been little research aimed at exploring the implications of the definition of the geographical limits of study area in the measurement of HSR territorial cohesion impacts. In this context, this paper presents a Geographical Information System (GIS)-based methodology which analyzes changes in the territorial distribution of accessibility resulting from HSR investments. These changes are analyzed at different planning levels, in order to assess the sensitivity of territorial cohesion results to scale definition. The methodology is tested by its application to the development of the 670 km of the Galician (north-western) HSR corridor included in the Spanish PEIT (Strategic Transport and Infrastructure Plan) 2005�2020. Cohesion impacts are assessed at different direct planning levels: regional, corridor and national levels, as well from the perspective of spillover effects. In all cases, the construction of the HSR corridor increases the accessibility values, and results show positive cohesion effects at the national and corridor levels, whereas at the regional level both balancing and polarization effects appear. These differences are mainly due to the location of HSR stations or to the quality of the transport network from the surrounding cities to the station, which determines the territorial distribution of accessibility improvements. Similar results are found from the spillover perspective.";"E Lopez,E Ortega,"
"The evolution and planning of hierarchical transport networks";"15548407300627151288";"2014";"The continuing growth of urban regions coupled with their strong\ninteractions with transportation systems places great emphasis on the\ncoevolution of these systems.

Secondly, these ideas are applied to a model of the evolution in\ntransport networks. Thirdly, it is shown that such a model can be\ntranslated into a planning context and the notion of an explicitly\nhierarchical dynamic model is introduced. An example of the use of such\na model of evolution within a network planning context is presented.\nThis explores the planning of network evolution in a case study of\nNaples arising from a new harbour which is under construction.

"Current operational urban land‐use–transport modelling frameworks: A review";"17564692245329390408";"2005";"Various alternative frameworks are available for modelling urban land-use transport interaction. This paper provides a detailed review of six of these frameworks that have been or are currently being used to develop operational models. The intention is to indicate what is the general nature of the current state of practice and what is now available for practical modelling work in the area. The intention is also to compare the current state of practice with what might be the ideal in various respects. The six frameworks reviewed (ITLUP, MEPLAN, TRANUS, MUSSA, NYMTC-LUM and UrbanSim) are considered in terms of their representations of physical systems, decision-makers and processes, along with various more general modelling and implementation issues. None matches the ideal as envisaged here in all respects. However, a wide range of policy considerations can be handled explicitly with what is available, and more recent developments show an encouraging trend towards expansion in the scope of what can be considered. Further strengthening of the behavioural basis and relaxation of some of the more restrictive assumptions would appear to be both appropriate and likely in the future.";"E. J. Miller,J. D. Hunt,D. S.

" The impact of railway stations on residential and commercial property value: a meta-analysis";"13445798032165848396";"2007";"Property values are affected by the properties’ physical, accessibility and environmental features. Railway stations function as nodes in transport networks and places in an urban environment. They have accessibility and environmental impacts, which contribute to property value. The literature on the effects of railway stations on property value is mixed in its finding in respect to impact magnitude and direction, ranging from a negative to an insignificant or a positive impact. This paper attempts to explain the variation in the findings by meta-analytical procedures. Generally the variations are attributed to the nature of data, particular spatial characteristics, temporal effects and methodology. The data can vary in relation to the type of property under study. Some indication is found to support the assertion that commercial properties enjoy a higher positive impact compared to residential properties. Commuter railway stations have a consistently higher positive impact on the property value compared to light and heavy railway/Metro stations. The inclusion of other accessibility variables (such as highways) in the models reduces the level of reported railway station impact. However this effect becomes insignificant for properties within a quarter-mile of the station, leaving the railway station as a major accessibility point. Our analysis did not find a significant effect of spatial and temporal factors.";"Piet Rietveld,Ghebreegziabiher Debrezion,Eric Pels,"
" Land-use/transport interaction models as tools for sustainability impact assessment of transport investments: review and research perspectives";"3718057397341599920";"2004";"Interest in the appraisal of the sustainability impacts of transport policies has grown the last few years, expressing the need for a balanced treatment of economic, environmental and social impacts. This paper represents a first step in creating a framework for Sustainability Impact Assessments  it will also review operational land-use/transport interaction models as assessment tools. An in-depth analysis of the potential impacts of land-use and transport policies, and scenarios, on the economy, society and the environment will present new challenges to land-use/transport interaction models. The first challenge is related to modelling behaviour: i.e. the model should estimate land-use, transport and accessibility impacts in a theoretically sound and consonant manner, and consistently link the full set of (long-term) land-use and (short-term) travel-behavioural responses to these policies. The second challenge is to improve methodologies to (better) include the wider (macro-)economic effects and the passive values. The third challenge is to generate more knowledge for understanding ecological and social impacts, and for the development of related indicators and methodologies to calculate them. A fourth, and final, challenge is related to the presentation and integration of the sustainability impacts, not only including the economic, ecological and social impacts, but also finding the ‘right’ balance between them. Although recent model developments facilitate a far more comprehensive analysis than is common practice today, there is certainly a need for theoretical and practical research for conducting Sustainability Impact Assessments of land use and transport policies and scenarios.";"Bert Van Wee,Karst T.

" Development of an integrated transport-land use model for the activities relocation in urban areas";"9738981332437076638";"2014";"The study presents a new Land Use - Transport Interaction (LUTI) planning model to provide an effective decision support system tool for the Urban Planning Administrations and to promote the use of the public transport system in urban areas. The idea is to relocate a subset of activities from urban zones with strong attraction, but poorly connected by the existing mass transit system, to urban zones close to the existing mass transit links with available residual capacity. This residual capacity is the main variable that indicates location and intensity of activities to be moved. The model has been applied for the real case study of the city of Rome in Italy. Results demonstrated the capability of the model to be a useful support system to suggest activities relocation pursuing the goal of sustainability for a short-term horizon.";"Marialisa Nigro,Marco Petrelli,Adrienne Brandi,Stefano Gori,"
"A network governance approach to transit-oriented development: Integrating urban transport and land use policies in Urumqi, China";"9284884965506661913";"2016";"Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is not only an urban planning tool but also a complex policy process that involves a network of actors with diverse perceptions, goals, resources and strategies. In such a multi-actor setting, effective implementation of TOD requires governance instruments and strategies aiming for the promotion of actor mutual recognition, goal alignment, information communication and the management of actor interaction. Most of the empirical research on TOD in China has focused on economically developed cities in the prosperous East of the country. To what extent and how cities in China's far West, which feature a different developmental trajectory in their land use, housing provision and transport patterns, adopt TOD still remains unknown territory. This article makes a beginning with the exploration of this topic by studying the Urumqi city in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Based on network governance theory, this article investigates the governance strategies used in Urumqi to integrate urban transport and land use policies. It presents a network governance model consisting of three rungs and concludes that a coordinative umbrella organization plays a significant role in eradicating problems of early substantive selection and perceptional fixation  successful policy integration requires careful goal alignment strategies that force actors to shift from go-alone strategies to interaction and concerted actions  institutional design and trust-building are also imperative for joint action.";"Martin de Jong,Rui Mu,"
"Bus rapid transit impacts on land uses and land values in Seoul, Korea";"1786504861447836048";"2009";"More and more cities are turning to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as a way of cost-effectively expanding public transit services to help relieve traffic congestion, reduce carbon emissions, and increase mobility options for the poor. Because of the inherent flexibility advantages of rubber-tire buses – e.g., unlike rail systems, the same vehicle that functions as a line-haul carrier can also morph into a neighborhood feeder -- BRT is especially suited for many lower density and non- CBD settings. Some of the most advanced and widely heralded BRT services today are found in Latin America, such as Curitiba and Sao Paulo, Brazil, Bogotá and Cali, Columbia, Santiago, Chile, and Lima, Peru. The success of BRT in these cities stems, to a large degree, from the presence of dedicated lanes, which offer significant speed advantages relative to more traditional mixed-traffic services. One of the few cities outside of Latin America that has joined the ranks of world-class BRT serviceproviders is Seoul, Korea. As in cities like Curitiba and Bogotá, Seoul operates dedicated median-lane BRT services which are supplemented by one of the most extensive networks of curbside BRT lanes anywhere. Seoul began implementing curbside bus lanes in 1986 however because of conflicts with traffic entering the main traffic stream these lanes failed to provide significant speed advantages. It was only after the addition of exclusive median lanes in 2004 that buses began to offer significant travel-time savings and win over former motorists. All else being equal, significant gains in bus speeds should be followed by significant land-use changes, like densification and property value increases, especially in congested mega-cities like Seoul. Land markets can be expected to place a high premium on parcels close to transit corridors that enjoy significant travel-time savings since, after all, such settings have scarcity value – i.e., there is a finite, limited supply of settings with superior transit offerings. This paper probes this hypothesis by studying land-use changes and property-value increases induced by Seoul’s introduction of exclusive, median-lane BRT services. First, the empirical literature on bus transit and land-use impacts is reviewed. This is followed by background discussions on Seoul’s transportation conditions and BRT system. Next, we describe our research methodology and supporting data sources. We then present multilevel models that gauge the influences of upgrading BRT services on land-use changes and land values. The paper concludes by reflecting on the policy implications of the key research findings.";"Robert Cervero,Chang Deok Kang,"
"Modeling urban expansion scenarios by coupling cellular automata model and system dynamic model in Beijing, China";"5280571749216175921";"2006";"Spatially explicit urban expansion models that can trace urban development in the past and predict the expansion scenarios in the future are indispensable for examining urban planning policies. This paper demonstrates a new urban expansion scenario (UES) model by coupling one bottom-up cellular automata (CA)-based model and one top-down system dynamics (SD)-based model. By implementing the UES model in Beijing, the urban evolution from 1991 to 2004 was simulated and the UESs from 2004 to 2020 were predicted. The results suggest that a dilemma of urban expansion versus limited water resource and environment deterioration exists.

The Leeds Integrated Land-Use Transport (LILT) model, which represents the relationships between transport costs and the spatial distribution of population, housing, jobs, employment and shopping is one such model and is described in this report. Transport supply is represented by the generalized cost of travel by private and public transport, and walking. Housing and jobs are located by the model  the population and workers occupying these and making trips between them are calculated in such a way that only those who are choosing new homes or jobs are relocated over time.

The framework is composed of a transport model and a multiregional Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The transport model measures a change in interregional shortest distances and the accessibility due to the highway project. The CGE model estimates the spatial economic effects of the project on GDP, the price, exports, and the regional distribution of wages and population. The simulation allows policy makers to determine which highway development deserves the priority for investment, based on consideration of economic growth and regional economic equity in the long run. The simulation found that all the highway projects have positive effects on GDP and export growth as well as regional equity in terms of wage and population. © 2004 The International Input-Output Association.";"G J D Hewings,C Hong,E Kim,"
"Combined impacts of highways and light rail transit on residential property values: A spatial hedonic price model for Phoenix, Arizona";"4911806436491011149";"2014";"This study analyzes the positive and negative relationships between housing prices and proximity to light rail and highways in Phoenix, Arizona. We hypothesize that the accessibility benefits of light rail transit (LRT) and highways accrue at nodes (stations and highway exits specifically), while disamenities emanate from rail and highway links as well as from nodes. Distance decay of amenities and disamenities is captured using multiple distance bands, and hypotheses are tested using a spatial hedonic model using generalized spatial two-stage least-squares estimation. Results show that proximity to transport nodes was associated significantly and positively with single-family detached home values. As a function of distance from highway exits and LRT stations, the distance-band coefficients form an inverted-U pattern consistent with a positive longer-range distance-decay accessibility effect minus a smaller and shorter-range distance-decay disamenity effect. The positive accessibility effect for highway exits extends farther than for LRT stations. Coefficients for the distance from highway and LRT links, however, were not significant. We also test the effect of highway design on home values and find that below-grade highways have relatively positive impacts on nearby houses compared to those at ground level or above. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.";"Michael Kuby,Aaron Golub,Kihwan Seo,"
"Urban form and travel behaviour: micro-level household attributes and residential context";"6816438350432176732";"2002";"Many countries now have policies to reduce distances travelled by private car and to favour the use of public transport, cycling and walking. The development of compact urban forms and the design of urban communities which favour walking are seen as particularly effective strategies for reducing car dependency. The factors which determine travel behaviour are not fully understood, so that effective policies influencing travel patterns are difficult to formulate. Apart from urban form and design, personal attributes and circumstances have an impact on modal choice and distances travelled. People with higher incomes are more likely to own and use a private car than low-income households. Families with children use cars more often than one-person households. The purpose of a trip-work, shopping and leisure-also influences travel mode and distance. We used the Netherlands National Travel Survey (OVG) to explore some of these relationships in more depth. The relative importance of personal attributes and the characteristics of residential environments as determinants of modal choice and travel distance were explored. Both sets of factors maintain a clear, strong relationship with travel behaviour in multivariate models of travel behaviour.";"Martin Dijst,Frans M Dieleman,G Burghouwt,"

" The strategic, dynamic and integrated urban land use and transport model MARS (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator)";"13172227782021916588";"2003";"Sustainability is one of today’s major public concerns. There is evidence that transport and land use systems of cities all over the world are unsustainable. Indicators backing up this hypothesis are among others: urban sprawl, pollution and consumption of non-renewable resources. As urban planning has become increasingly complex, decision support tools are essential to help to achieve the overall objective of sustainability. Recent research has shown that any single policy instrument cannot achieve sustainability. Policy strategies employing several instruments are needed to be successful. The use of formal models and optimisation methods is suggested to be used to identify the best performing strategy. Research of the last decades has shown that land use and transport form a closely linked dynamic system. Therefore integrated land use and transport models are needed to assess the performance of urban policy strategies. A literature review has shown that a variety of operational transport and/or land use models exists. The current trend in land use and transport modelling is characterised by an extreme dis-aggregation even down to individual household level. This extremely detailed modelling approach is, independently from its theoretical appeal, inappropriate for identifying sustainable policy strategies. Despite the ever-increasing computational power, model runs take too long to be able to consider a reasonable number of instruments. Additionally data needs are very high. Even synthetic data have to be produced to match the level of model dis-aggregation. Data requirements might be one of the reasons why the use of integrated land use and transport models is still not widespread. A different approach was therefore chosen for the work presented here. The rather high aggregated integrated, dynamic urban land use and transport model MARS (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulation) was developed as the core of a sustainability assessment framework. The underlying hypothesis is that cities are self-organising systems and that the principles of synergetics can be applied to describe collective behaviour. A qualitative model was developed based on Viennese research. The method of causal loop diagrams was used for this task. From this basis a quantitative model was built and written into code. MARS was calibrated for the city of Vienna. An extensive model-testing program was carried out using observed data from 1981 to 2001. A back casting exercise and sensitivity tests have proven the usability of MARS. Nevertheless some weak points were identified. It was possible to find explanations for them. Potential fields for future improvements were identified and ranked. A case study with the Vienna MARS model was carried out. Transport projects currently planned and under construction were assessed towards their contribution to official Viennese city planning objectives. An appropriate policy strategy to achieve these goals was identified using formal optimisation procedures.";"Paul Pfaffenbichler,"

"Accessibility Impact of the Suburbanization of High-Speed Rail Stations in China";"1261624366439909540";"2015";"In recent years, China has built the longest and most heavily used high-speed rail network in the world. But many cities' high-speed rail stations are located in suburbs, and the loss of time affects the efficiency of the high-speed rail. The author analyzes the stations of Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railways and Wuhan-Guangzhou high-speed railways to estimate the distance and transfer time from a high-speed rail station to downtown areas, indicating the accessibility impact caused by the suburbanization of the high-speed rail stations. The study suggests that the suburbanization of high-speed railway station is mainly attributed to the lack of integrated transport planning, development of the new districts in a city, as well as the purpose to reduce the cost of land and engineering.";"Yu Hu,Hongchang Li,"
"Topological evolution of surface transportation networks";"15049090676952779807";"2009";"This study explores the topological evolution of surface transportation networks, using empirical evidence and a simulation model validated on that data. Evolution is an iterative process of interaction, investment, and disinvestment. The temporal change of topological attributes for the network is also evaluated using measures of connectivity, density, heterogeneity, concentration, and connection patterns. The simulation model is validated using historical data from the Indiana interurban network. Statistical analyses suggest that the simulation model performs well in predicting the sequence of link abandonment in the interurban network as well as the temporal change of topological attributes. The simulation model is then applied on different idealized network structures. Typical connection patterns such as rings, webs, hub-and-spokes, and cul-de-sacs emerge in the networks  the spontaneous organization of network hierarchies, the temporal change of spacing between parallel links, and the rise-and-fall of places in terms of their relative importance are also observed, providing further evidence for the self-organization property of surface transportation networks. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Overview of land use transport models";"3647216975258379343";"2004";"The previous chapters in this Handbook have shown that spatial development, or land use, determines the need for spatial interaction, or transport, but that transport, by the accessibility it provides, also determines spatial development. However, it is difficult to empirically isolate impacts of land use on transport and vice versa because of the multitude of concurrent changes of other factors. This poses a problem if the likely impacts of integrated land-use and transport policies to reduce the demand for travel are to be predicted. There are principally three methods to predict those impacts. The first is to ask people how they would change their location and mobility behaviour if certain factors, such as land use regulations or transport costs, would change ('stated preference'). The second consists of drawing conclusions from observed decision behaviour of people under different conditions on how they would be likely to behave if these factors would change ('revealed preference'). The third method is to simulate human decision behaviour in mathematical models. All three methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Surveys can reveal also subjective factors of location and mobility decisions, however, their respondents can only make conjec- tures about how they would behave in still unknown situations, and the validity of such con- jectures is uncertain. Empirical studies based on observation of behaviour produce detailed and reliable results  these, however, are valid only for existing situations and are therefore not suited for the assessment of novel yet untested policies. In addition it is usually not possible to associate the observed changes of behaviour unequivocally with specific causes, because in reality several determining factors change at the same time. Mathematical models of human behaviour are also based on empirical surveys or observa- tions. The difference is that the conclusions to be drawn from the survey and observation data are quantified. Strictly speaking, the results of mathematical models are no more universally valid than those of empirical studies but are only valid for situations which are similar to those for which their parameters were estimated. Nevertheless it is possible to transfer human be- haviour represented in mathematical models within certain limits to still unknown situations. In addition, mathematical models are the only method by which the effects of individual de- termining factors can be analysed by keeping all other factors fixed. In this chapter recent developments in the field of operational integrated land-use transport models will be reviewed with special emphasis on their ability to test both land use and trans- port policies and to assess their impacts.";"Michael Wegener,"
"Effects of urban rail transit expansions: Evidence from sixteen cities, 1970-2000 ";"14049005034234653393";"2005";"FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL governments have spent more than $25 billion to establish or expand rail transit infrastructure in sixteen major U.S. metro-politan areas between 1970 and 2000. Billions more have been invested to maintain and improve existing rail transit lines. Despite the significant infra-structure improvements associated with these investments, transit ridership has been declining rapidly. The fraction of metropolitan area commuters in the United States using public transit declined from 0.12 in 1970 to 0.06 in 2000. Furthermore, only in a few metropolitan areas has transit increased its share of the commuting market since 1970, and in none of these areas did transit garner more than 10 percent of the market in 2000. In this paper, we evaluate the extent to which rail transit improvements have spurred new ridership and we provide some rough estimates of the value of these new commuting options. We demonstrate the importance of consid-ering heterogeneous responses of commuting mode choice both within and between metropolitan areas to the existence of new rail lines. For example, in each metropolitan area except Chicago, commuters living beyond ten kilo-meters of the city center and within two kilometers of a new rail transit line increased their transit use between 1970 and 2000. However, most metropol-itan areas saw declines in ridership within ten kilometers of the city center in areas near and far from new rail lines alike. Variation in metropolitan area structure is also key in determining whether new rail lines succeed at attract-ing riders. Rail transit is more likely to be successful in more densely popu-lated and centralized cities. Of the sixteen cities that significantly expanded their rail infrastructure after 1970, we find that Washington stands out as a place where rail transit investments have had relatively high returns. Finally, we find little evidence that significant ridership gains due to new rail lines continue to accrue more than a few years after construction is completed. Panel data at the census tract level allow us to evaluate the effects on rider-ship of new rail lines by making two types of comparisons. Exploitation of within metropolitan area variation in access allows for comparison of areas of each city that received new rail transit to equivalent areas that did not. Time series variation in transit access allows for comparison of the same census tract in each city over time. This difference-in-difference type comparison ultimately identifies our estimates of ridership gains as a result of new rail transit. Census data on commuting times and the number of rail, bus, and car commuters allow us to roughly calculate the number of commuting hours saved as a result of new rail transit construction. We develop a simple theoretical model that provides intuition about the spatial patterns in commuting mode choice adjustments that one may expect to see as result of new rail transit infrastructure. The implications of the model motivate the specifications used in public transit use regressions. These regres-sions incorporate potentially heterogeneous responses of public transit use to new rail infrastructure as a function of the year the system was built, distance to the city center, and physical structure of the metropolitan area as a whole. These regressions form the core empirical contribution of this paper. We use the regression estimates to evaluate the extent to which new rail transit causes people to change commuting modes, allowing us to roughly quantify the wel-fare benefits of recently constructed rail lines and to make some predictions about the likely success or failure of rail transit construction projects currently underway in several U.S. cities. Our study builds on earlier research investigating the consequences of rail transit investments. In a previous paper, we document that transit ridership saw less than average declines near new rail lines constructed in five U.S. cities during the 1980s. 1 On the other hand, metropolitan areas have been decentralizing such that existing transit infrastructure facilitates access to a smaller fraction of residents and employment. 2 This is reflected in falling 2 Brookings-Wharton Papers on Urban Affairs: 2005";"Matthew E.

First, in a game theoretic framework that describes the location choices made by retailers with respect to each other, the connection between relative firm location and transportation demand is outlined. Second, a multivariate point pattern statistic based on this theoretical framework is applied to location patterns of fast food outlets to measure the effects that major road infrastructure has on firm location behavior in this sector.The results suggest that transportation infrastructure affects the location behavior of firms with respect to their location in relation to their competitors. Access to important transportation infrastructure induces competing outlets to locate next to each other-a tendency not necessarily observed among outlets without such access. Theoretically, this does not only affect economic outcomes, but also travel demand and consumer accessibility. The findings from this study stress the importance of accounting for how transportation infrastructure changes the location behavior of firms in travel demand frameworks.";"Oleg A.

"Measuring TOD around transit nodes-Towards TOD policy";"2461466985030055448";"2017";"Transit Oriented Development (TOD) can stimulate sustainable development by improving the interaction between transit and the surrounding development. Planning for TOD around existing transit nodes can only be effective if the assessment of the base situation is done properly. To do so, we propose a methodology to quantitatively measure existing levels of TOD in terms of a TOD Index, within walkable distance of a transit node, by measuring various criteria that define TOD. The value of a TOD index indicates the level to which TOD supporting characteristics are inplace around a transit node and what may be required to be improved so as to attain better transit orientation of thedevelopment. With these results in hand, TOD planning proposals can become more accurate by targeting investments on the most relevant or critical factors. The methodology was applied to the city region of Arnhem and Nijmegen, The Netherlands. A TOD index was calculated for areas around the 21 train stations in the region. The results help in drawing TOD policy for the region by identifying which station areas need more attention than others and at the same time, for each station, identifying specific TOD characteristic(s) that need improvement.";"Yamini Jain Singh,Johannes Flacke,Azhari Lukman,Mark Zuidgeest,M.

"Transit-oriented land planning model considering sustainability of mass rail transit";"2024160217331154543";"2010";"With the acceleration of urbanization, the mass rail transit (MRT) is developing rapidly in China. However, some unsustainable problems are brought to many metropolitan governments, such as the expensive costs of MRT construction and operation, the incompatibility between MRT and its surrounding land use, the difficulty of MRT sharing the benefits brought by itself, etc. Therefore, for the sustainability of MRT, this research presents a transit oriented development (TOD) planning model of China. The paper put forward the objective functions and constraints of China TOD (CTOD) model and designed the algorithm of this multiobjective optimal problem. The problem is divided into two phases and parallel genetic algorithm is adopted. By these methods, the Pareto optimization solution set is searched so that it can offer some alternative land-use schemes. Taking the example of Dan Zhutou station of Shenzhen metro third line constructing, the land-use schemes in walking available scope of MRT station are designed considering MRT sustainability. The optimization results are alternative schemes of land-use type and land-use density in planned region, so that the land use can ensure the sustainable development of MRT.";"Heng Li,Z. R. Wang,G.

"A unifying modelling framework to simulate the Spatial Economic Transport Interaction process at urban and national scales";"8447436889705718760";"2012";"Much effort has been expended in the last decades in developing modelling frameworks to simulate the so-called Spatial Economic Transport Interaction (SETI) process. Models have been originated according to autonomous bodies of knowledge connected to the analysis and interpretation of each reference spatial scale: urban and national. However, there have been few exchanges of knowledge flowing from one scale to another.This paper proposes a unifying modelling framework able to capture the two-way relationship between spatial economic and transport systems at both the national and urban scales. Four main elements are presented: (i) a literature review of Spatial Economic (SE) models at national and urban scales  (ii) a description of the theoretical evolution involving a class of SE models from the theoretical backgrounds to the current formulations  (iii) the proposition of a SETI model which has two modelling components: a transport macro-model and a spatial economic macro-model  (iv) a model specification for national and urban scales. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.";"Francesco Russo,Giuseppe Musolino,"
"Urban concentration: the role of increasing returns and transport costs";"18272623801279535261";"1996";"Very large urban centers are a conspicuous feature of many developing economies, yet the subject of the size distribution of cities (as opposed to such issues as rural-urban migration) has been neglected by development economists. This article argues that some important insights into urban concentration, especially the tendency of some developing countries to have very large primate cities, can be derived from recent approaches to economic geography. Three approaches are compared: the well-established neoclassical urban systems theory, which emphasizes the tradeoff between agglomeration economies and diseconomies of city size  the new economic geography, which attempts to derive agglomeration effects from the interactions among market size, transportation costs, and increasing returns at the firm level  and a nihilistic view that cities emerge out of a random process in which there are roughly constant returns to city size. The article suggests that Washington consensus policies of reduced government intervention and trade opening may tend to reduce the size of primate cities or at least slow their relative growth.";"Paul Krugman,"
" Les territoires du tramway moderne: de la ligne à la ville durable";"10809851577547721507";"2007";"L’implantation de nouvelles lignes de tramway peut-elle contribuer à l’émergence d’une ville durable ? Pour répondre à cette question, cet article part d’un modèle théorique insérant le système économique de transport dans trois environnements : environnement économique général, environnement social, environnement naturel. Une nouvelle ligne de tramway correspond à une nouvelle offre dans le système économique de transport d’une aire urbaine. Cette nouvelle offre produit des effets potentiels sur le système économique de transport et sur ses trois environnements. Ces effets sont recensés à partir de différentes études des agences d’urbanisme de Nantes, Grenoble et Strasbourg. Ils sont regroupés dans trois espaces géométriques : la ligne, le corridor, le périmètre. Il est possible ensuite d’organiser ces espaces en territoires concrets correspondant à la rue, aux quartiers accessibles à pied et à l’ensemble de la ville. Le projet de ville durable a alors pour ambition d’utiliser les effets potentiels du tramway moderne pour une reproduction conjointe dans l’espace urbain de la sphère économique, de la sphère sociale et de la biosphère.";"Jacques Stambouli,"
" Exploring land use and transport interaction through structural equation modelling";"15105548367120422804";"2012";"Transport systems and land use are two mutually interconnected elements: the location of the activities and their need for interactions produce transport demand  on the other hand, transport supply system supporting transport demand and performance levels of transport services affect the activity locations. In this paper the relationship among the factors affecting transportation and land-use systems interactions was investigated and a GIS was used for exploring the relationship among some spatial variables regarding geographical features, activity location, demographic and economic characteristics, and transportation variables such as trip production and attraction, and accessibility. Analysing the relationship among the variables, unobserved or “latent” variables affecting land-use and transport interactions were identified and introduced in a structural equation model. This approach allows the modelling of a phenomenon by considering both unobserved “latent” constructs and observed indicators describing the phenomenon. The results show that travel behaviour is more influenced by the economic characteristics of population. These analyses allow identifying the relationships among variables related to land use and transportation system, and can provide some findings for transportation planners as well as assisting the complex process of urban planning decision-making.";"Carmen Forciniti,Laura Eboli,Gabriella Mazzulla,"
"A model of the rise and fall of roads";"12450184136848850546";"2004";"Transportation network planning decisions made at one point of time can have profound impacts in the future. However, transportation networks are usually assumed to be static in models of land use. A better understanding of the natural growth pattern of roads will provide valuable guidance to planners who try to shape the future network. This paper analyzes the relationships between network supply and travel demand, and describes a road development and degeneration mechanism microscopically at the link level. A simulation model of transportation network dynamics is developed, involving iterative evolution of travel demand patterns, network revenue policies, cost estimation, and investment rules. The model is applied to a real-world congesting network – the Twin Cities transportation network which comprises nearly 8,000 nodes and more than 20,000 links, using network data collected since year 1978. Four experiments are carried out with different initial conditions and constraints, the results from which allow us to explore model properties such as computational feasibility, qualitative implications, potential calibration procedures, and predictive value. The hypothesis that road hierarchies are emergent properties of transportation networks is confirmed, and the underlying reasons discovered. Spatial distribution of capacity, traffic flow, and congestion in the transportation network is tracked over time. Potential improvements to the model in particular and future research directions in transportation network dynamics in general are also discussed.";"D . Levinson,L. Zhang,"
" Functional-spatial sustainability potentials of integrated infrastructure planning";"13530799405573833349";"2012";"In response to societal, political and financial-economic dynamics, a trend towards integration of road infrastructure planning and planning of other land use functions can be observed. Effects of this trend – which is especially visible in the Netherlands, but can also be recognized in other countries – are observable in spatial development plans, designs and projects, as well as the organizational sides of planning. In this paper we take a substantial perspective regarding these innovations  we make a distinction between broadening of the functional scope and the spatial scope of projects. Both deserve careful consideration in the optimization of synergy among planning sectors, which can be seen as a concrete reflection of often abstract sustainability principles. Traditional barriers between spatial policy sectors (‘silos’) have to be overcome in order to optimize this synergy, while traditional administrative boundaries often hamper the definition of optimal project areas needed for context-specific infrastructure development. This paper aims to analyse the broadening of these scopes from a theoretical and empirical perspective. In order to examine the relationship between planning scopes and sustainability of outcomes we propose an analytical framework based on a review of scientific literature and policy documents. After this we explore the position of these concepts within Dutch road infrastructure planning and build on the experiences gained through our involvement in the development of a planning instrument for sustainable integrated developments. The insights are used to draw conclusions about the relationship between the functional and spatial scope of infrastructure projects and their potential contribution to a more sustainable road infrastructure planning practice, in terms of synergy and spatial quality. Furthermore, possible consequences for the organizational side of infrastructure planning are discussed.";"Niels Heeres,Taede Tillema,Jos Arts,"

"Accessibility modeling and evaluation: The TIGRIS XL land-use and transport interaction model for the Netherlands";"13076030584230478433";"2015";"In current practice, transportation planning often ignores the effects of major transportation improvements on land use and the distribution of land use activities, which might affect the accessibility impacts and economic efficiency of the transportation investment strategies. In this paper, we describe the model specification and application of the land use transport interaction model TIGRIS XL for the Netherlands. The TIGRIS XL land-use and transport interaction model can internationally be positioned among the recursive or quasi-dynamic land-use and transport interaction models. The National Model System, the main transport model used in Dutch national transport policy making and evaluation, is fully integrated in the modeling framework. Accessibility modeling and evaluation are disaggregated and fully consistent, which is not common in accessibility modeling research. Logsum accessibility measures estimated by the transport model are used as explanatory variables for the residential and firm location modules and as indicators in policy evaluations, expressing accessibility benefits expressed in monetary terms. Modeling results indicate that accessibility changes from transport investments in the Netherlands have a significant but modest positive influence on the location choice of residents and firms. This is probably mainly due to the spatial structure and already dense and well developed transport networks, and the large influence of national, regional and local governments on the Dutch land use markets.";"Karst T.

" Transport and land use interaction: A French case of suburban development in the Lille Metropolitan Area (LMA)";"14281071046327149112";"2014";"Transit Oriented Development as sustainable mobility strategy is not part of French policy, in practice or in academic literature, even though a certain number of projects follow some of its principles. Reciprocally, from abroad, French experiences are not recognized as TOD, even when they could be. Scientific literature is needed in this direction. This is the focus of this paper. This paper identifies two realizations that can be qualified as TOD implementations according to criteria that we have defined previously in a Franco-German research program (Bahn.Ville). For each of these two cases, while their transport network is examined, we also study their insertion into the urban environment at a local level. The interaction between land use and transport system is the focal point of this study through a reading of planning documents, geospatial data specific processing and analysis, and on-site investigations. Parallel analysis is undertaken on the processes of realization. In both cases, we look into cooperation between public and private actors from multiple sectors and on different scales. Combining actual planning strategies, we examine policies of metropolitan level that support similar realizations in the future, not only in the field of transport, but also on housing and economic activities. Therefore, we present existing and future instruments for the implementation of TOD in the Lille Metropolitan Area. New planning tools, such as DIVAT and Contrat d'axe, are designed in the intent of defining intersectoral policies of transport and urbanism. These tools are currently being introduced and put into practice in Lille Metropolis.";"Liu Liu,L'Hostis Alain,"
"Heuristic urban transportation network design method, a multilayer coevolution approach";"9433653206824619514";"2017";"The design of urban transportation networks plays a key role in the urban planning process, and the coevolution of urban networks has recently garnered significant attention in literature. However, most of these recent articles are based on networks that are essentially planar. In this research, we propose a heuristic multilayer urban network coevolution model with lower layer network and upper layer network that are associated with growth and stimulate one another. We first use the relative neighbourhood graph and the Gabriel graph to simulate the structure of rail and road networks, respectively. With simulation we find that when a specific number of nodes are added, the total travel cost ratio between an expanded network and the initial lower layer network has the lowest value. The cooperation strength Λ and the changeable parameter average operation speed ratio Θ show that transit users’ route choices change dramatically through the coevolution process and that their decisions, in turn, affect the multilayer network structure. We also note that the simulated relation between the Gini coefficient of the betweenness centrality, Θ and Λ have an optimal point for network design. This research could inspire the analysis of urban network topology features and the assessment of urban growth trends.";"Rui Ding,Rong Li,Norsidah Ujang,Mohd Shahrudin Abd Manan,Jianjun Wu,Hussain bin Hamid,"

"Integrating land-use and transport infrastructure planning: towards adaptive and sustainable transport infrastructure";"5608357364609047162";"2014";"Transport infrastructure authorities across Europe face ever-tougher challenges to accommodate increased traffic while dealing with climate change and delivering environmental and societal objectives. This requires a shift from current small-scoped – ad hoc, technical solution driven – planning approach towards a broad/network-scoped – strategy driven – planning approach. This paper builds on a research programme developed for EU's Horizon 2020 in which Transport Infrastructure is Integrated with Land-Use Planning (TIILUP). This proposed approach is discussed using Dutch experiences, addressing such issues as: spatial concepts (e.g. multi-modal corridors, nodal development, transit oriented development), multi-modal network optimisation at various spatial scales, life-cycle issues, combined value creation and capturing, and institutional and governance approaches. It is concluded that only by an inclusive approach addressing these various issues an adaptable, sustainable and resilient transport network can be achieved that is closely coordinated with spatial development.

Empirical analysis provides evidence that light rail has had some positive effects on single-family property values, transit use, and slower growth of two-plus car households in the outer part of the LRT corridor as compared with an outer part of a parallel bus corridor. These effects might be the result of households self-selecting to locate near LRT rather than the result of current households changing their mode. This assessment of the evidence indicates the extent to which consumer preferences have responded to LRT investments. This kind of assessment is needed to provide the basis for estimating travel-mode shares and market shares for dispersed and concentrated development forms. Examination of data suggests that it might be advisable for planners to entertain more modest expectations of LRT.";"M J Bianco,K J Dueker,"

The LUTI model was applied to the metropolitan area of Santander (Spain) to check its base year goodness of fit and therefore its ability to predict the impacts of introducing different transport policies. In the case of Santander, the property price and population/economic activity location submodels showed sensitivity to the different accessibility and transport characteristics of each zone, and the model as a whole provided a good degree of fit.

Dynamic land use and transport interaction models provide a good platform to study this mutual interaction. In this paper, we introduce one instance of these models, a cellular automata (CA)-based land-use/transport interaction model (LUTI), which was applied to the quickly growing metropolitan area of Jeddah. The model was calibrated using a stage-wise calibration and evaluated using an independent validation. The CA-based LUTI model outperforms a similar stand-alone CA-based model, which indicates that land use and transport interact and that models for understanding urban dynamics benefit from including the feedback between both systems. Such understanding facilitates the estimation of future dynamics of land-use change and transport in cities, and can support the development of alternative spatial plans and policies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.";"Martin van Maarseveen,Jasper van Vliet,Mohammed Aljoufie,Mark Brussel,Mark Zuidgeest,"

In this chapter, one segment of this complex relationship is discussed: the two--way interaction between urban land use and transport within urban regions. The chapter looks at integrated models of urban land use and transport, i.e., models that explicitly model the two--way interaction between land use and transport to forecast the likely impacts of land use and transport policies for decision support in urban planning. The discussion starts with a review of the main theories of land--use transport interaction from transport planning, urban economics, and social geography. It then gives a brief overview of selected current operational urban models, thereby distinguishing between spatial interaction location models and accessibility--based location models, and discusses their advantages and problems. Next, it reports on two important current debates about model design: are equilibrium models or dynamic models preferable, and what is the most appropriate level of spatial resolution and substantive disaggregation? This chapter closes with a reflection of new challenges for integrated urban models likely to come up in the future.";"Michael Wegener,"

"A design framework for measuring transit oriented development";"445792216820660267";"2012";"Transit Oriented Development (TOD) has been a promising concept to establish land use and transport integration, thereby creating more sustainable communities. Literature suggests that the benefits of TOD are manifold but also different for each stakeholder. A literature survey furthermore reveals that there is no standard definition nor a generally accepted aim for TOD, which is not very surprising because of the different perspectives of stakeholders in the process of achieving TOD. In addition it has been found that different methods and various sets of indicators to evaluate and measure TOD have been proposed. Examination of a number of case studies shows that these methods have hardly been operationalised. To guide decision making for new transit oriented development(s) it is essential to have a framework and a tool to quantitatively measure current levels of TOD at a location and in an area. The tool also needs to be flexible and able to support participatory planning processes. This paper provides a literature survey on the TOD concept and its operationalisations and it presents a design framework for a tool that enables quantitative measurement of TOD. © 2012 WIT Press.";"J.

It is shown that results of the previous model structure can be reproduced by the new fully microscopic modeling system based on SILO and MATSim. It is discussed how an agent-based transfer of information can also be established in the reverse direction, i.e. from the transport model to the land-use model based on the implementation of a query architecture.

"Relationship between transport accessibility and land value: Local model approach with geographically weighted regression";"4418397137131889429";"2006";"In recent years, land value capture has attracted increasing attention because of its potential for funding transport infrastructure. It is well acknowledged that transport infrastructure can improve accessibility to employment and amenities  thus one might expect that it is the improved accessibility that adds value to land. Therefore, the issues in the relation- ship between transport accessibility and land value rise in connection with the concept of land value capture. A study looked at the relationship between transport accessibility and land value with the implication of a local model, geographically weighted regression (GWR). Tradi- tional techniques, such as hedonic models, used to understand the attributes of land value, are global models that could be misleading in examining the spatially varying relationships, such as transport acces- sibility and land value. By using the Tyne and Wear region in the United Kingdom as a case study, the study revealed that nonstationarity exist- ing in the relationship between transport accessibility and land value indicates that transport accessibility may have a positive effect on land value in some areas but a negative or no effect in others  this suggests that a uniform land value capture would be inappropriate. The use of GWR allows such spatially varying relationships to be revealed, leading to a better understanding of the factors determining positive land value uplift and the implications of spatially dependent transport access premiums in housing values in the context of value capture policies.";"Corinne Mulley,Hongbo Du,"

"High-speed rail and office location choices. A stated choice experiment for the Netherlands";"10281642940978705087";"2011";"High-speed rail is seen as a factor contributing to the attractiveness of a location for economic activities. This paper focuses on how the level-of-service characteristics of railway stations, and in particular the presence of high-speed train services, influence the attractiveness of locations for specific types of offices. The results are presented for a stated choice experiment for location choices of offices in the Netherlands. It is concluded that the availability of high-speed train services contributes to the attractiveness of a location for offices. For internationally-oriented offices the areas around stations with international high-speed train services are attractive because of their good international accessibility. We also found an indication that high-speed train services can raise the status of an office site. In the Netherlands, the domestic high-speed train services are less relevant for location choices, because of the small domestic distances. Besides high-speed train services, other location characteristics that determine how well a site is connected to the railway network are also found to be important for location choices. Thereby differences between offices occur, which can partly be explained by the number of trips to/from an office. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.";"Bert Van Wee,Jasper Willigers,"
"Assessing the accessibility impact of transport policy by a land-use and transport interaction model–The case of Madrid";"7403034735160752310";"2015";"Accessibility is typically evaluated by using separately a transport model or a land-use model. This paper embeds two accessibility indicators (i.e., potential and adaptive accessibility) in a land use and transport interaction (LUTI) model in order to assess transport policies implementation. The first aim is to define the adaptive accessibility, considering the competition factor at territorial level (e.g. workplaces and workers). The second aim is to identify the optimal implementation scenario of policy measures using potential and adaptive accessibility indicators. The analysis of the results in terms of social welfare and accessibility changes closes the paper.Two transport policy measures are applied in Madrid region: a cordon toll and increase bus frequency. They have been simulated through the MARS model (Metropolitan Activity Relocation Simulator, i.e. LUTI model). An optimisation procedure is performed by MARS for maximizing the value of the objective function in order to find the optimal policy implementation (first best). Both policy measures are evaluated in terms of accessibility.Results show that the introduction of the accessibility indicators (potential and adaptive) influence the optimal value of the toll price and bus frequency level, generating different results in terms of social welfare. Mapping the difference between potential and adaptive accessibility indicator shows that the main changes occur in areas where there is a strong competition among different land-use opportunities.";"Andres Monzon,Floridea Di Ciommo,Yang Wang,"
"Spatial economic impacts of transport infrastructure supply";"9341831984796026101";"1994";"This paper contains a survey of studies on the spatial economic impacts of transport infrastructure supply. A theoretical framework is developed where impacts of transport infrastructure on spatial economic development are measured in terms of productivity changes and (re)location behaviour. The transmission takes place via changes in generalized transport costs and accessibility. Methods for analyzing transport infrastructure impacts are classified according to the level of aggregation of the data (aggregate versus disaggregate) and the degree of model use (modelling versus nonmodelling approaches). Two spatial levels arc distinguished: intra-urban versus intraregional. At the intraregional level it is found that integrated land use-transport models usually yield infrastructure impacts of limited size. Much larger impacts are usually found when entrepreneurs are directly interviewed about these impacts as they perceive them. At the interregional level, production function approaches usually lead to the conclusion that infrastructure supply has a considerable impact on the productivity of other production factors. On the other hand, the relocation impacts of transport infrastructure on economic activity as predicted by multiregional models are usually limited.";"P Rietveld,"
"The co-evolution of land use and road networks";"4920442333449600615";"2006";"This paper explores the co-evolution of land use and transportation, which is a poorly understood field despite progress in studying each separately. Our study models the co-evolution of land use and transportation network as a bottom-up process by which re-location of activities and expansion of roads are driven by interdependent decisions of individual businesses, workers, and road owners according to simple decision rules. The model was kept simple to best illustrate collective spatial patterns of land use distribution without conflating factors. The sensitivity of these patterns is also discussed. A Simulator of Integrated Growth of Networks And Land-use (SIGNAL) is developed to implement these decentralized decision making processes, in which the Gini index and equivalent radius were computed to describe and track down the spatial patterns of space and network. Simulation experiments were conducted to explore the evolution of land use patterns in the context of the coevolution of land use and road networks. Experimental results demonstrate that initially flat land uses become more concentrated while initially concentrated land uses become less so, and they tend to converge on the same hierarchical distribution, suggesting that a stable hierarchical distribution of land use may emerge from different initial conditions. Experiments also reveal that the concentration of land use is reinforced by the differentiation of roads.";"Feng Xie,Shanjiang Zhu,David Levinson,"
"Space evolution model and empirical analysis of an urban public transport network";"7045171621225464890";"2012";"This study explores the space evolution of an urban public transport network, using empirical evidence and a simulation model validated on that data. Public transport patterns primarily depend on traffic spatial-distribution, demands of passengers and expected utility of investors. Evolution is an iterative process of satisfying the needs of passengers and investors based on a given traffic spatial-distribution. The temporal change of urban public transport network is evaluated both using topological measures and spatial ones. The simulation model is validated using empirical data from nine big cities in China. Statistical analyses on topological and spatial attributes suggest that an evolution network with traffic demands characterized by power-law numerical values which distribute in a mode of concentric circles tallies well with these nine cities.";"Yi Sui,Ren-cheng Sun,Feng-jing Shao,Shu-jing Li,"
"Can the high speed rail reinforce tourism attractiveness? The case of the high speed rail between Perpignan (France) and Barcelona (Spain)";"12567231728166421187";"2009";"The transport system plays an important role in tourism destination development. A high speed railway authorizes a reduction in transportation costs and can be a tool for tourism destination development by allowing accessibility improvement. Nevertheless, this improvement is often synonymous with reinforcement of spatial competition between tourism destinations. New economic geography (NEG) models show that agglomeration and dispersion forces determine the spatial structure of economy. These two opposing forces are influenced by transportation costs. A decrease in transport costs can reinforce the concentration of economic activities. A prospective analysis investigating the case of the forthcoming South European HSR lines between Perpignan and Barcelona shows that the resulting increased spatial competition may reinforce the phenomenon of the tourism activities agglomeration around Barcelona to the detriment of Perpignan. Tourism product differentiation is one solution for Perpignan to confront agglomeration forces. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"Sophie Masson,Romain Petiot,"

"On the spatiotemporal dynamics of the coupling between land use and road networks: does political history matter?";"16479176245494201907";"2015";"© 2014 Pion and its Licensors.The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of political history on the dynamics of the interrelationship between land use and road networks within cities. Political history, in this study, is defined as the combination of the regional-level government programs and political events that affect the pattern of urbanization in a region. The study focused on urbanization in the cities of Pordenone and Gorizia, both situated in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region of northeastern Italy, over the period 1950–2000. Being located adjacent to an international boundary, the city of Gorizia has a long history of political instability dating back to the beginning of the 20th century. It is assumed that this political instability has led to the application of differential socioeconomic policies which have affected the process of urbanization in the city. The aim of the study was to capture this effect by investigating the structural changes over the period of fifty years in both land use and the road network. In order to understand the extent of the effect Pordenone was used for comparison, since it has experienced a relatively peaceful past and regular growth. MOLAND (monitoring land-use/cover dynamics) data for land use and the road network were used for the study. Graph theory measures were used for a comparative analysis of the structural properties of road networks in both cities and their development over time. In order to understand the spatial relationship between change in land use and the road network, a nonparametric test of the spatial correspondence of areal distribution was used and tested at multiple spatial scales. The results suggest that political history does affect the land-use and road-network changes individually, but it did not affect the type of spatial relationship that exists between the two for those particular cities. This research makes a unique attempt to analyze the impact of policy on land-use and road-network change by using spatial data and methods of analysis which can help to understand their overall dynamics and that can be used as an alternative to data-intensive and time-intensive simulation models.";"Gargi Chaudhuri,Keith C.

"Time Evolution of Road Networks";"6724452877162375479";"2015";"Urbanization is a fundamental phenomenon which however still remains poorly quantitatively characterized. An important facet of this phenomenon is the road network which co-evolves with other urban structures and we review here the most recent results about the structure and the evolution of these important infrastructures. These studies suggest that the natural evolution of a road network is governed by two elementary processes: (i) ‘densification', which corresponds to an increase in the local density of roads around existing central points and (ii) ‘exploration' which consists in new roads triggering the spatial evolution of the urbanization front. However, interventions of central, top-down planning could modify this simple picture of a natural evolution and we will present the example of the street network of Paris (France), which during the nineteenth century experienced large modifications supervised by a central authority, the ‘Haussmann period'. In this case, the usual network measures display a smooth behavior and the most important quantitative signatures of central planning are the spatial reorganization of centrality and the modification of the block shape distribution. Such effects can only be obtained by structural modifications at a large-scale level, with the creation of new roads not constrained by the existing geometry. These different results suggest that the evolution of a road network results from the superimposition of continuous, local growth processes and punctual changes operating at large spatial scales, opening new directions for the modelling of these systems.";"Marc Barthélémy,"

"Accessibility and territorial cohesion in a case of transport infrastructure improvements with changing population distributions";"7376709710337748824";"2016";"urpose In the last decade or so several studies have looked into the impacts of transport infrastructure improvements on decreasing territorial disparities. In those studies population levels are usually assumed static, although future population levels likely change in response to changing accessibility levels as well as to other factors. To test how much accessi- bility impacts may be affected by changes in population levels, this study explores the effects of foreseeable population changes on the accessibility improvements offered by large scale transport infrastructure investments. Methods In this study we compare accessibility measures from four cases, namely the current situation  one case in which only transport investments are taken into account  and two cases that include transport investments and two scenarios with differing future population distributions that in turn are simulated by the LUISA land-use model. The modelled trans- port investments are assumed to improve travel times. The study concentrates on accessibility effects in Austria, Czech Republic, Germany and Poland. To provide a reference to the found results, the same computations are repeated with historical population and road network changes. Results The results indicate that differences in local popula- tion levels have a limited effect on average accessibility levels, but may have a large impact on territorial inequalities related to accessibility. Conclusions The findings in this study underpin the impor- tance of incorporating future local population levels when assessing the impacts of infrastructure investments on territo- rial disparities.";"Chris Jacobs-Crisioni,Carolina Perpiña Castillo,Carlo Lavalle,Claudia Baranzelli,Ana Barbosa,Filipe Batista e Silva,"

The probability of driving to work is lower the higher are population centrality and rail miles supplied and the lower is road density. Population centrality, jobs-housing balance, city shape, and road density have a significant effect on annual household VMTs. Although individual elasticities are small absolute values ( <= 0.10), moving sample households from a city with the characteristics of Atlanta to a city with the characteristics of Boston reduces annual VMTs by 25%.";"K Vinha,A M Bento,A M Mobarak,M L Cropper,"

"Linking urban transport and land use in developing countries";"581933628528961027";"2013";"The mobility challenges of the developing world are considerably different than those in wealthier, advanced countries, and so are the challenges of coordinating transportation and land use. Rapid population growth, poverty and income disparities, overcrowded urban cores, poorly designed road networks, spatial mismatches between housing and jobs, deteriorating environmental conditions, and economic losses fromextreme traffic by congestion are among the more vexing challenges faced by developing cities that could be assuaged through improved coordination of transportation and urban development. This is underscored by examples reviewed in this paper from South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, India, Africa, and South America. It is concluded that whatever is done to improve transportation and land-use integratio nmust be pro-poor. The cardinal features of integrated and sustainable transport and urbanism everywhere — accessible urban activities and safe, attractive walking and cycling environs — are particularly vital to the welfare and prosperity of urbanites in the world’s poorest countries.";"Robert Cervero,"
"Joint accessibility design: framework developed with practitioners to integrate land use and transport planning in the Netherlands";"9279271717247468535";"2009";"In both the scientific and the professional communities, the need to integrate transport and land use policies to achieve more sustainable mobility patterns is widely recognized. Three challenges to attaining integrated strategies are identified. The first challenge is to find a common language and concepts that stimulate communication between disciplines. The second challenge is to create more explicit links between broader economic, social, and environmental goals and transport policies. The third challenge is to put more emphasis on policy design, the phase in the planning process in which opportunities for policy integration are maximal but which is poorly supported by current transport planning approaches. Accessibility is a concept that can address all three challenges. It relates to features of the transport system (speed, travel costs) as well as the land use system (densities, opportunities) and can be related to wider goals within society (for example, access to jobs). A well-known and wellstudied concept within the scientific literature, accessibility is nonetheless not often used. This paper develops a framework to stimulate the joint design of accessibility-enhancing strategies, and the framework is then tested and developed in cooperation with practitioners in two case studies in the Netherlands.";"Thomas Straatemeier,Luca Bertolini,"

In the model, we adopt the physical diffusion process, which considers the influence of the road network topology and random exploration factor, to analyse the population diffusion based on the cellular automata (CA) model. In addition, the growth mechanism of the road network is developed to minimize the construction cost related to the population density and the Euclidean distance. The distribution complexities of the population density and the road network topology in the evolution process are then analysed. Compared with the real Beijing city in 2012, the suggested model can be used to describe the city evolution process.";"Huijun Sun,Rong Li,Rui Ding,Tongfei Li,Jianjun Wu,"
" The effect of infrastructure on long run economic growth";"18091431345429858831";"2004";"We investigate the long run consequences of infrastructure provision on per capita income in a panel of countries over the period 1950-1992. Simple panel based tests are developed which enable us to isolate the sign and direction of the long run effect of infrastructure on income in a manner that is robust to the presence of unknown heterogeneous short run causal relationships. Our results provide clear evidence that in the vast majority of cases infrastructure does induce long run growth effects. But we also find a great deal of variation in the results across individual countries. Taken as a whole, the results demonstrate that telephones, electricity generating capacity and paved roads are provided at close to the growth maximizing level on average, but are under-supplied in some countries and over-supplied in others. These results also help to explain why cross section and time series studies have in the past found contradictory results regarding a causal link between infrastructure provision and long run growth.";"Peter Pedroni,David Canning,"

This paper provides a systematic review of recent empirical evidence from the USA, Europe and East Asia, classified regarding the type of transport infrastructure (road or rail), LU indicator (land cover, population or employment density, development type) and outcome (significance, relationship’s direction) as well as influential exogenous factors. Proximity to the rail network is generally associated with population growth (particularly soon after the development of railway infrastructure), conversion to residential uses and the development of higher residential densities. Meanwhile, proximity to the road network is frequently associated with increases in employment densities as well as the conversion of land to a variety of urban uses including commercial and industrial development. Compared with road infrastructure, the impact of rail infrastructure is often less significant for land cover or population and employment density change. The extent of TINs’ impact on LU over time can be explained by the saturation in TIN-related accessibility and LU development.";"D. Stead,B. van Wee,D. Kasraian,K. Maat,"
"Rail transit and joint development: Land market impacts in Washington, DC and Atlanta";"17274035543169056854";"1994";"Land around urban rail transit stations can be val- uable because it is so accessible. Joint development of transit stations and nearby office buildings oc- curs because both the public and private sectors recognize its financial rewards. This article exam- ines how transit investments and joint develop- ment in particular affect five indicators of office market conditions: average rents  vacancy rates  absorption rates  densities  and shares of new and total office and commercial construction near the stations. Data are examined for five rail stations in the Washington, D. C. and Atlanta areas over the 1978-89 period. Average office rents near stations rose with systemwide ridership  joint development projects added more than three dollars per gross square foot to annual office rents. Office vacancy rates were lower, average building densities higher, and shares of regional growth larger in station areas with joint development projects. Where re- gional market conditions are favorable, rail transit appears capable of positive impacts on station area office markets. Combining transit investments with private real estate projects appears to strengthen these effects. The findings suggest that the rationale behind value recapture and other benefit-sharing programs is economically sound for conditions similar to those of the case study areas.";"Robert Cervero,"
" Modèles d'intégration spatiale et réseau des villes en Europe occidentale";"14436860538273457118";"1998";"nullRésumé. — L'article montre comment la mise en réseau des villes européennes est une construction complexe qui se situe à l'articulation de quatre modèles principaux : le modèle centre-périphérie, celui des systèmes urbains nationaux, celui du réseau des «capitales» et, enfin, celui des réseaux spécialisés de villes. Cette dynamique d'intégration du réseau des villes européennes joue sur trois registres, valorisant chacun des logiques spatiales différentes. La première est une logique relationnelle, qui apparaît doublement intégratrice dans la mesure où elle opère à différents échelons géographiques, jouant à la fois sur les effets de la dépendance avec la distance et sur les effets liés aux nouvelles possibilités de connexions. La deuxième est une logique de ressources qui continue d'imposer une mise en valeur différentielle des lieux. La troisième enfin est une logique de maillage qui, à son tour, infléchit les dynamiques. Abstract. — Models of geographical integration and the Western European urban network. — This paper aims to demonstrate that the networks between the cities of western Europe are complex structures shaped by the combined action of four main models : the core-periphery model, the national urban systems model, the capital network model and the specialised urban network model. It goes on to show how the movement towards increased integration of the western European urban network is conditioned by three different spatial logics. The first is a relational logic, comprising the two highly integrative forces of networking based on geographical proximity and networking made possible by new technology. The second is a resources- based logic, which continues to differentiate places. The third is a logic of national administrative divisions, which tends to work against integration.";"Thérèse Saint-Julien,Nadine Cattan,"
"A TOD planning model to review the regulation of allowable development densities around subway stations";"17412736314612590072";"2006";"Transit-oriented development (TOD) planning generally emphasizes development efficiency, but ignores the other two aspects of sustainability: environment quality and social equity. This study has developed a multi-objective programming model for TOD planning. Based on the concept of sustainability, three objectives are considered: maximizing subway system ridership  maximizing living-environment quality  and optimizing the social equity of land development. The decision variables are the ratios of floor space to site space (RFS) for different land uses in subway station areas. Meanwhile, the constraints include restrictions on land use density, land use combinations, and level of service facilities. The Chunghsiao-Fuhsing station area in Taipei is chosen as a case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. From sensitivity analysis, it is found that enlarging the upper bound of RFS can increase subway ridership, but at a cost of reducing social equity and living environment. It is not necessary to set the upper bound of the RFS greater than 70%, because subway ridership does not significantly increase, in this case study. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"J.

"Light rail proximity: Benefit or detriment in the case of Santa Clara County, California?";"6642187910472493264";"2001";"When the public sector sponsors projects to promote general welfare, disproportionate benefits or disproportionate burdens often fall on individuals. In Santa Clara County, California, private property owners sued the county for damages, claiming a burden due to the existence of light rail transit (LRT). By looking at rental rates for commercial property, the present research tests several hedonic specifications to determine what effect, if any, LRT has on proximate property values. It also compares transit accessibility with highway accessibility as determinants of rent. An understanding of this effect allows the county to make informed decisions in its defense against the suits brought and allows other government entities to make informed decisions with respect to the building of future LRT systems. The results indicate that, when controlling for other factors, properties that lie within 0.8 km (0.5 mi) of a light rail station command a higher lease rate than other properties in the county. When controlling for highway access, the rail proximity benefit was maintained, and it was shown that highway coverage in the county is so dense that there are no particular locational advantages associated with highway coverage.";"R R Weinberger,"

This paper describes the design and prototype implementation of an integrated model system that involves the microsimulation of location choices in the land use domain, activity–travel choices in the travel demand domain, and individual vehicles on networks in the network supply modeling domain. Although many previous applications of integrated transport demand– supply models have relied on a sequential coupling of the models, the system presented in this paper involves a dynamic integration of the activity–travel demand model and the dynamic traffic assignment and simulation model with appropriate feedback to the land use model system. The system has been fully implemented, and initial results of model system runs in a case study test application suggest that the proposed model design provides a robust behavioral framework for simulation of human activity–travel behavior in space, time, and networks. The paper provides a detailed description of the design, together with results from initial test runs.";"Yi-Chang Chiu,Brian Gardner,Mark Hickman,Hyunsoo Noh,Karthik C.

Major centrality measures of closeness, betweenness, and straightness are calculated at both global and local levels in both the primary and dual representations of the urban street network. Adaptive kernel density estimation is adopted to transform all unevenly distributed datasets to one continuous raster framework for further analysis. After computing statistical and spatial distribution of each centrality and land-use density map, we find that the density of each street centrality is highly correlated with one type of land use. Results imply that various centralities representing street properties from different aspects can capture the land development patterns of different land-use types by reflecting human activities, and are consequently important indicators to describe urban structure.";"Yikang Rui,Yifang Ban,"

This article strives to contribute to this knowledge by first analysing the influence of accessibility and agglomeration on firm behaviour with exceptionally detailed firm data for the province of South Holland in The Netherlands. Next the added value of incorporating such effects in urban simulation models is tested with two series of validation runs with a microscopic model for firm dynamics. The presented Spatial Firm-demographic Micro-simulation (SFM) model simulates transitions and events in the firm population, including firm relocations, firm growth, firm dissolution and firm formation. Accessibility is measured with proximity to infrastructure access points and logsums of business and commuting trips from a transport model. Agglomeration measures are based on theories from urban economics and integrate travel time range bands into measures for specialisation and diversification. Estimation results confirm a significant influence of accessibility and agglomeration on the choice behaviour of firms. Application of these measures prove to increase the validity of the firm-demographic simulation model to a significant but modest extend. ¬© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";"M de Bok,"

"Developing transit-oriented corridors: Insights from Tokyo";"16163531430831005128";"2014";"Various studies have pointed out that a successful integration of public transport and land use requires plans covering the entire metropolitan region that are consistent over a long period of time. The proposition that is explored in this article is that railway corridors can offer an effective spatial and institutional focus for this. For this purpose, a real-world case in Tokyo, where a corridor-based approach is central to the coordination of public transport and land-use developments, was examined. The analysis combines and links spatial and institutional dimensions. Three criteria are employed in the spatial analysis: corridor transport characteristics, land-use densities, and land-use mix. On the institutional side, the role the local government and the private railway sector play in developing railway corridors in Tokyo is discussed. The exploration seems to support the proposition that the railway corridor can be a convenient spatial and institutional unit in which to integrate transport and land-use developments. However, translation to other metropolitan areas of elements of the Tokyo approach would have to adequately acknowledge contextual differences.";"Paul Chorus,Luca Bertolini,"
"Spatial development patterns and public transport: the application of an analytical model in the Netherlands";"1728787302865949564";"1999";"The node-place model introduced in this article offers a conceptual framework for the exploration of the (re)development potential of station areas in an urban region and thus improves the chances for public transport-oriented development. The model requires further refinement, broadening of the empirical base, and inclusion of future plans. A thorough consideration of the more qualitative aspects of station area (re)development strategies has to be added, and a complementary, in-depth analysis of each specific situation, including process and context factors is also necessary (see, for some steps along this way Bertolini, 1996, 1998  Bertolini and Spit, 1998). In spite of these limits the application of the node-place model to the Amsterdam and Utrecht agglomerations already provides material for reflections of a more general nature. I would like to conclude with some, still exploratory and deliberately provocative, remarks in this direction. The node-place model helps identify opportunities for intensification and/or differentiation of urban activities around (strengthened) public transportation nodes. These might be central stations in the historical cores, but also public transport nodes in the urban periphery (as the stations along the Amsterdam railway and motorway ring) or in secondary regional centres (in the application these are places such as Hoofddorp and Weesp south of Amsterdam, or Woerden west of Utrecht). The city is an increasingly open system. Increasingly people live, work and spend their free time independently of municipal borders. The same applies to the activity patterns of firms and other organisations. A traditional 'compact city' policy is possibly still sensible in situations where this structural openness of the urban system is limited. Elsewhere an urban development strategy, geared to the accessibility of urban-regional networks of transportation nodes and activity places, appears more adequate. Some will say that this strategy reminds them of the 'clustered deconcentration' policies of the past. Maybe. I would prefer to use a term like 'deconcentrated clustering'. It might seem just playing with words, but there is a fundamental difference in the focus: in the past at stake was a particular way of deconcentrating, today urban deconcentration is a fact, the point is how to cluster!.";"L.

"Redistributive effects of bus rapid transit (BRT) on development patterns and property values in Seoul, Korea";"2765907686933992521";"2012";"This study investigates the redistributive effects of Seoul's bus rapid transit (BRT) system on development patterns and property values using an urban simulation model. The Seoul Metropolitan Integrated Urban Model (SMIUM) combines the Seoul metropolitan input-output model with random utility-based location choice models and endogenous real estate markets.The major findings of this study can be highlighted as follows. First, Seoul's BRT contributes to increased development density in urban centers, acting as a centripetal force to attract firms from the suburbs into urban cores and supporting arguments for Smart Growth proponents. Second, unlike its redistributive effects on nonresidential activities, the BRT has a limited effect on the redistribution of residential activities, implying that residential locations are less sensitive to accessibility improvements made by the BRT than are nonresidential locations. Third, reflecting the transferred space demands from the suburbs to the urban cores, the CBD reaps the highest property value gains, while all of the outer ring zones suffer from reduced property values. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.";"Myung J.

" Urban Road Network Evolution to Maximize the Capacity";"12516749824028037592";"2014";"Urban network planning efforts is to achieve the maximum capacity under a certain road investment. As we all know that a good decision can save cost and increase the capacity of the total network. In our previous study, a new computational model of urban spatial evolution has been studied, where people migrate between urban locations, balancing their tendency to explore with their preferential wish to join existing communities. Based on the previous results, this paper presents an urban network evolution model considering road investment and capacity. When a new community is generated, decision-makers will plan to investigate the road construction according to the important degree. Generally speaking, high investment leads to a high road level and big capacity. The decision's objective is to maximum the capacity of the road. In order to achieve this goal, our model focuses on optimal road network, considering maximum capacity under the limited investment, and can determine which road to build and what level of the road. A simulation model is developed to include the topology of road evolution, the structure of road level, and the changes of network capacity over time. Specially, we also simulate the road network evolution with different initialization (with one center and two centers). On one hand, simulation results show that the high investment can bring the big capacity, and different structures can be gain with different initialization. On the other hand, it is also concluded that more centers can improve the traffic capacity of road network.";"Huijun Sun,Fangxia Zhao,Ziyou Gao,Jianjun Wu,"

"Multiple criteria decision-making techniques and their applications–a review of the literature from 2000 to 2014";"1709037592918865759";"2015";"Multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) is considered as a complex decision-making (DM) tool involving both quantitative and qualitative factors. In recent years, several MCDM techniques and approaches have been suggested to choosing the optimal probable options. The purpose of this article is to systematically review the applications and methodologies of the MCDM techniques and approaches. This study reviewed a total of 393 articles published from 2000 to 2014 in more than 120 peer reviewed journals (extracted from Web of Science). According to experts? opinion, these articles were grouped into 15 fields. Furthermore, these articles were categorised based on authors, publication date, name of journals, methods, tools, and type of research (MCDM utilising research, MCDM developing research, and MCDM proposing research). The results of this study indicated that in 2013 scholars have published articles more than in other years. In addition, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method in the individual tools and hybrid MCDM in the integrated methods were ranked as the first and second methods in use. Additionally, the European Journal of Operational Research as the first journal with 70 publications was the significant journal in this study. Finally, energy, environment and sustainability were ranked as the first areas that have applied MCDM techniques and approaches.";"Khalil MD Nor,Zainab Khalifah,Alireza Valipour,Norhayati Zakwan,Ahmad Jusoh,Abbas Mardani,"
"Understanding road network dynamics: Link-based topological patterns";"8547422887510478727";"2015";"Road network interruptions caused by natural disasters are becoming more frequent and their consequences are becoming of a wider range. The main goal of this work is to identify the most important roads in a network. Herein, a new model is proposed to evaluate the most important roads in the network through the application of biclustering technique, identifying patterns of attributes (road performance measures) and patterns of roads (connectivity patterns). Thereafter the model presented here is compared with the mean geodesic distance variation. Both methodologies are applied to a case study and the pros and cons are discussed as well. Results point out the alpha index as the topological measure more relevant in the normal network flow  moreover the interruption of the links with highest values of connectivity will have larger consequences in the normal functioning of the network than the links with the lowest levels of connectivity. The approach here proposed is a useful insight of the network dynamics, which allows optimizing the worst-case performance of the system. This work can be useful for risk management actors, for civil protection agents, who need to decide on the effective allocation of human and physical resources and define priority areas, and for the government institutions which design the network of facilities.";"Susana Freiria,Bernardete Ribeiro,Alexandre O.

"Introduction to the special issue The regional and urban effects of high-speed trains";"11113342855832408846";"1997";"High-speed trains could be used to solve two different accessibility problems. In the first case, where a point to point link is dominant, they are a potential substitute for air travelling. In the second case it links together many cities and, hence, creates a new type of region or corridor with a high interregional accessibility. One important hypothesis for the discussion in this paper is the degree to which cities that are linked together into a band of cities by means of a high-speed train connection are transformed to an extended functional region or in other words an integrated corridor economy. This paper particularly examines economic integration in a corridor economy in the short, medium and long term. In considering the short-term perspective we discuss not only the integration of goods and service markets but also the integration of labour markets and markets for shopping, private services and leisure activities. The discussion of the medium term perspective is concentrated on the relocation of households and firms within a high-speed train corridor. To study the long-term integration effects of a high-speed train corridor we maintain that the analysis must be conducted using a genuinely dynamic model for the specialisation of production and, hence, for trade with and transport of goods and services and consequently transport of people.";"U.

"Transit's value-added effects: light and commuter rail services and commercial land values";"6684170136495887910";"2002";"Transit-oriented development has gained favor as a means of reducing traffic congestion, promoting affordable housing, and curbing sprawl. The effects of proximity to light and commuter rail stations are modeled as are the effects of freeway interchanges on commercial-retail and office properties in fast-growing Santa Clara County, California. From hedonic price models, substantial capitalization benefits were found, on the order of 23% for a typical commercial parcel near a light rail transit stop and more than 120% for commercial land in a business district and within 0.25 mi of a commuter rail station. Such evidence is of use not only to developers and lenders but also to transit agencies facing lawsuits over purported negative externalities associated with being near rail. It can also help in the design of creative financing, such as value-capture programs.";"Robert Cervero,Michael Duncan,"
"Measuring the neighborhood benefits of rail transit accessibility";"4393706071311534606";"1997";"For many Americans, living near high-quality rail transit stations provides an array of benefits. The benefits arise from lower transportation expenses, changing development patterns, and other nonuse factors. Automobile-centered development patterns increase congestion, sprawl, and pollution. The benefits of transit-oriented neighborhoods are explored. A hedonic price function is used to estimate property values and the effect of proximity to rail transit stations. Geographical information system databases were used to calculate actual walking distances to transit, providing a much more accurate measure of the proximity variable than the usual measure of straight-line distance. The results indicate that proximity to rail transit stations can be a significant source of benefit to residents within walking distance. Whereas light rail transit stations in Portland, Oregon, indicate minimal effects, the magnitude of the benefits for the Bay Area Rapid Transit and New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority stations, when compared with standard measures of transit benefits, indicate that benefits from transit exceed those attributable to transit use.";"Steven Lewis-Workman,Daniel Brod,"
"Rail-based public transport and urban spatial structure: The interplay between network design, congestion and urban form";"1657458344343870183";"2015";"We examine the effect of spatial differences in access to a railway network on both urbanization and road congestion in a typical 'transport corridor between cities' setup. Using a spatial urban equilibrium model, we find that if the number of access nodes, i.e. stations, is limited, stations contribute to the degree of urbanization. The total effect on road congestion, however, is small. By contrast, if stations are omnipresent there is little effect on urban spatial structure, but a considerable decrease in congestion. This suggests there is a policy trade-off between congestion and urbanization which crucially depends on the type of railway network. We find similar results for a within-city metro network. The key methodological contribution is that, besides the dependence between mode choice and where to work/live, the model allows for differences in the degree of substitutability - local competition - between transport modes. We find that an increase in the substitutability between car travel and railway travel substantially decreases the congestion reduction benefits of a dense railway network.";"Martijn I.

"Infrastructure, long‐run economic growth and causality tests for cointegrated panels";"3411011351715304243";"2008";"We investigate the consequences of various types of infrastructure provision in a panel of countries from 1950 to 1992. We develop new tests which enable us to isolate the sign and direction of long-run effects in a manner that is robust to the presence of unknown heterogeneous short-run causal relationships. We show that while infrastructure does tend to cause long-run economic growth, there is substantial variation across countries. We also provide evidence that each infrastructure type is provided at close to the growth-maximizing level on average globally, but is under-supplied in some countries and over-supplied in others.";"Peter Pedroni,David Canning,"
"Optimal Land Use—Transport Strategies: Methodology and Application to European Cities";"9935339511624817265";"2005";"There has been growing interest in Europe in the development of integrated transport strategies, in which individual policy instruments are combined to complement one another and to achieve improved performance against a given set of policy objectives. This paper applies an optimization procedure to identify optimal strategies for packages of transport policy instruments without, and then with, constraints on finance and targets for global warming and safety. Some exploratory tests have also been carried out on land use strategies, and they are reported here in brief. Results demonstrate that the methodology is robust and can be applied with different transport models and with constraints applied both to policy instruments and to objectives. All optimal strategies found involved substantial reductions in fare levels throughout the study area. Where it was not possible to change fares, the strategies were substantially less effective when measured against the objectives. Most optimal strategies involved increases in public transport frequencies, although their scale varied between cities. All optimal strategies included peak-period cordon charges to enter the city center, though the optimal level varied between cities. Financially constrained strategies were found to involve smaller fare reductions and higher cordon charges  in some cases frequency increases were smaller. These constrained optima still performed well  the greatest reduction in benefit was only 15%. The net present value of the benefit generated was about {€20,000M} (€1 = $1.20 {US}, 2005) in Edinburgh and more than {[€4,000M} in Leeds, United Kingdom. The impact of transport strategies on land use was small, and development constraints had to be used to reverse urban sprawl.";"Anthony May,Simon Shepherd,Neil Paulley,Andrew Ash,Xiaoyan Zhang,Guenter Emberger,"

The Analytic Hierarchy Process was used, utilising two approaches to derive the weights. Results show that the outcome of the Multi-Criteria method did not match the one suggested by the Cost Benefit Analysis, but it did match the final decision by the authority. An important conclusion has to do with the relevance of incorporating other aspects into the assessment, apart from the economic ones. Furthermore, public opinion should be taken into account explicitly into the decision making, providing accurate and timely information about projects.";"Rene Cisternas,Alejandro Tudela,Natalia Akiki,"
"Identifying the impacts of rail transit stations on residential property values";"13588936307863952369";"2001";"Prior studies that have empirically investigated the impact of rail station proximity on property values have not fully investigated the factors that may account for this relationship. Stations may raise the value of nearby properties by reducing commuting costs or by attracting retail activity to the neighborhood. Possibly countering these positive effects are negative externalities emitted by stations and the access to neighborhoods that stations provide to criminals. This paper sorts out these effects by presenting the results from estimating a hedonic price model and auxiliary models for neighborhood crime and retail activity. Results show that all four effects play a role in defining the relationship between property values and rail stations, but the relative importance of these effects varies with distance from downtown and the median income of the neighborhood.";"Keith R.

"Co-evolution of density and topology in a simple model of city formation";"5911724637352669367";"2009";"We study the influence that population density and the road network have on each others' growth and evolution. We use a simple model of formation and evolution of city roads which reproduces the most important empirical features of street networks in cities. Within this framework, we explicitely introduce the topology of the road network and analyze how it evolves and interact with the evolution of population density. We show that accessibility issues -pushing individuals to get closer to high centrality nodes-lead to high density regions and the appearance of densely populated centers. In particular, this model reproduces the empirical fact that the density profile decreases exponentially from a core district. In this simplified model, the size of the core district depends on the relative importance of transportation and rent costs.";"Alessandro Flammini,Marc Barthélemy,"
"Is investment in high speed rail socially profitable?";"8971822581675494264";"2007";"The development of High Speed Rail (HSR) in Europe has been encouraged, and financially supported, by the European Commission. HSR technology is presented as a solution to congested roads and airports and as an efficient response for incremental demand in the coming years. However, the case for an HSR investment project is highly dependent on the existing volume of demand in the affected corridor. Using real construction, maintenance, and rolling stock costs of the European HSR lines in operation, potential time savings, standard values of time and expected demand growth, we estimate the minimum level of demand required from which investment in HSR could be considered profitable from a social perspective. Other benefits, such as providing long-term capacity where overcrowding is expected, could reduce the minimum demand thresholds reported in this paper.";"Ginés de Rus,Gustavo Nombela,"

" Modélisation de l'interaction transport-urbanisme-choix résidentiels des ménages dans l'aire urbaine de Lyon";"5605752058287937946";"2009";"L'objectif de la thèse est de proposer une modélisation des comportements résidentiels des ménages : le choix de changement de résidence (ou de déménagement) et le choix d'une nouvelle localisation. Ce type de modèles vise à prévoir la probabilité qu'un ménage change de résidence et son choix en matière de nouvelle localisation, en fonction d'un certain nombre de variables explicatives. Dans notre cas, la modélisation est fondée sur la théorie des choix discrets (approche de l'utilité aléatoire). La recherche s'appuie sur le cas lyonnais, le modèle étant construit sur l'aire urbaine de Lyon, sur des données de l'année 1999. En termes de résultats, du côté de la mobilité résidentielle, il faut retenir que les variables qui expliquent la variation du degré de mobilité (du taux de déménagement) des ménages sont l'âge de la personne de référence du ménage, le nombre d'enfants et le statut d'occupation du logement. En ce qui concerne la localisation des ménages, les préférences des ménages pour une zone ou autre sont liées aux caractéristiques de celles-ci et notamment à l'accessibilité aux différentes opportunités et services, ce qui confirme que parmi les facteurs qui influencent le comportement de localisation des ménages on retrouve les accessibilités, et donc, l'hypothèse de l'existence d'un lien entre transports et urbanisme. On a également trouvé que les caractéristiques des ménages comme l'âge de la personne de référence, le revenu ou le nombre de personnes ont une influence sur leurs choix de localisation. L'étude et les résultats des modèles suggèrent que des améliorations et nouvelles pistes de recherche sont possibles. Ainsi, du côté de la mobilité résidentielle, il pourrait y avoir d'autres variables qui motivent les ménages à changer de logement, comme des caractéristiques des logements, de l'environnement résidentiel ou d'autres caractéristiques des ménages non observées. Il serait aussi intéressant d'estimer le modèle de localisation a un niveau géographique encore plus fin (à l'îlot). D'autres alternatives de modélisation des décisions résidentielles des ménages seraient de modéliser une structure hiérarchisée des choix, par un modèle logit hiérarchique ou emboîté, ou bien de modéliser la trajectoire de vie, avec ses composantes familiale, résidentielle et professionnelle, qui sont en interdépendance (à condition de la disponibilité des données nécessaires).";"George Marius Homocianu,"

"Potential Impact of Housing Policy on Transportation Infrastructure in Chinese Cities";"14631122393807503549";"2007";"Directive No. 165, a new directive from the Chinese central government-specifically, the Department of Construction-requires that 70% of new residential units be smaller than 90 m2, as of June 1, 2006. The directive raised great concerns after initial confusion and speculation, not only for land developers and consumers but also for urban and transportation planners. The intention of the new policy is clearly targeted to tame ever-rising housing prices and bring affordable housing to average citizens. However, it is questionable whether the policy at its face value can achieve those objectives. The policy's effect on land use, urban form, infrastructure, and eventually the housing market is as yet unknown. This paper focuses on the potential effect of the new housing policy on urban infrastructure, particularly transportation. On the basis of the historical urban development in China, Western experience, and current problems and issues encountered by most large metropolitan areas worldwide, the authors caution that the new housing policy may create an unexpected negative effect on transportation infrastructure and make the already congested roadways in most urban areas in China even worse. Some modifications or relevant strategies are needed to achieve the objective of housing affordability while not sacrificing quality of life. It is suggested that connections be made between housing development and urban infrastructure such as transportation, power, water, and comprehensive land use policies to achieve balanced growth and avoid potential social problems.";"Yi Deng,Rongfang Liu,"
"Balancing building and maintenance costs in growing transport networks";"5976460068571547857";"2016";"The costs associated to the length of links impose unavoidable constraints to the growth of natural and artificial transport networks. When future network developments can not be predicted, building and maintenance costs require competing minimization mechanisms, and can not be optimized simultaneously. Hereby, we study the interplay of building and maintenance costs and its impact on the growth of transportation networks through a non-equilibrium model of network growth. We show cost balance is a sufficient ingredient for the emergence of tradeoffs between the network's total length and transport effciency, of optimal strategies of construction, and of power-law temporal correlations in the growth history of the network. Analysis of empirical ant transport networks in the framework of this model suggests different ant species may adopt similar optimization strategies.";"Arianna Bottinelli,Remi Louf,Marco Gherardi,"
" Patterns and grammars for transport network generation";"9665071086377166905";"2010";"Generation and optimization of transport networks remain major topics in transport planning, especially in emerging cities, but also in existing transport systems. This article addresses hierarchies, grammars and patterns for transport network generation. Network hierarchies define types of nodes and links. Network grammars describe rules how nodes and links of certain types can be added and joined to each other. Network patterns describe specific alignments of links and nodes which result from grammars and hierarchies. This paper emphasizes the importance of grammar rules for the generation of transport networks using grammar rules. So far, only little research has addressed network hierarchies, grammars and patterns. This article focuses on optimal transport networks in a general way, based on the analysis of synthetically generated networks. The starting positions of the synthetic networks are featureless planes with given demand generating points. Possible historical network structures are currently ignored. Given a certain node alignment on a featureless plane, links are added or rearranged in order to built-up and optimize the transport network. The objective is to minimize generalized costs, comprising the most relevant components, e.g. travel time and infrastructure costs. A budget constraint limits the level of service and number of links. Network grammars are compared through analyzing two network states. On one hand, synthetic networks are generated without use of any grammar rule. On the other hand, network grammars are included in the network generation process. Resulting networks are evaluated to compare different grammar rules. Network patterns directly derive from the resulting synthetic networks.";"Bj Vitins,Kw Axhausen,"

More important, the results provide sup- port for amodelin which planning is ratio- nal behavior by a local government and that plans—independent of regulations— can be used to alter urban development patterns for the purpose of increasing so- cial welfare.

A good example of this problem is my home city of Atlanta, where the rapid-transit system has been laid out for the convenience of the white upper-middle-class suburbanites who commute to their jobs downtown. The system has virtually no consideration for con- necting the poor people with their jobs.

"On the development of raem: The dutch spatial general equilibrium model and it's first application to a new railway link";"14419148078104479576";"2001";"This paper describes the development of a spatial computable general equilibrium model aimed at estimating the indirect economic effects of major transport infrastructure projects on Dutch regions. The RAEM model is based in the so-called new economic geography literature. It employs monopolistic competition for fourteen sectors as the basic market form, and calibrates most of its coefficients on recently constructed bi-regional input-output tables for the Netherlands. The general outline of the model is described and the way it fits in with evaluation schemes presently adopted by the Dutch government and the European Commission. A first version of the model has been applied to a base scenario for the year 2020 and has been used for evaluating the indirect economic effects of a new railway link between Amsterdam and Groningen. The paper describes the results of this exercise and discusses the way the RAEM model will be developed further in the near future.";"Jan Oosterhaven,T Knaap,"
"Injecting a rapid rail link into a metropolis";"12888682099709140912";"2009";"The Gautrain Project being developed in the Gauteng province of South Africa is currently the largest construction project on the African continent. At an estimated cost of some US$3000 million, it surpasses any previous single project in South Africa, and will result in a vital rapid rail link between Johannesburg, Pretoria and Johannesburg's OR Tambo International Airport. The total route length of 80 km will comprise some 15 km in tunnels in Johannesburg, about 10.5 km on viaducts along various sections of the route, and the balance on the surface or in shallow open cuts. The Gautrain is being developed by the Gauteng Provincial Government through a Public Private Partnership concession contract with an international consortium of major players in the construction, public transport vehicle manufacturing and operations fields. While construction will take place over a period of some four years to 2011, the Concessionaire will operate the full system for a further 15 years, after which the Province will assume the responsibility. With ten stations being built along the route, some in virtual green field surroundings and others in high density urban areas, and some deep underground and others using air rights above ground, profound land use challenges and opportunities arise. Superimposing a rapid rail artery of this magnitude onto the urban landscape of three metropolitan areas is bound to have considerable environmental and land use impacts. This paper demonstrates, at a critical stage in the civil construction programme, how these impacts are being addressed and how the natural and built environment is being considered and perhaps even enhanced, rather than being adversely affected. © 2009 WIT Press.";"J.

" Spatial economic impacts of transport infrastructure investments";"4099685160755234978";"2003";"Estimating the spatial economic impacts of transport infrastructure is an unsolved issue that has plagued economic science for a long time. This paper will give an overview of the basic problem, the contributions of the empirical literature, the modelling approaches used until now, a recent application, and a perspective on how to proceed. The basic problem lies in establishing the 'anti monde', that is, the economic development that would have occurred without the investment in infrastructure. This basic problem is burdened with uncertainty about the direction of the impact of new transport infrastructure on the regions or nations affected. As infrastructure reduces the cost of both imports and exports of goods and services, the net effect is not clear. Macro economic research only gives indications about the demand and supply effects of bundles of historical investments in infrastructure. This only with considerable debate about the econometrics and the causality implied by the estimations. Moreover, macro research has only limited value when taking decisions on specific infrastructure projects. Surveys among firms and consumers have various measurement problems, but they also have the advantage of providing ex ante micro information. Among the major disadvantages are strategic answers, sample selection and the inability to capture indirect effects on non-using firms or consumers. Economic potential models for interregional infrastructure and land-use/transportation interaction (LUTI) models for intra-urban infrastructure provide the best empirical answers to the question of the economic impacts of transport investments. Both approaches, however, show one major defect, namely an unsatisfactory foundation in economic theory. A promising alternative is provided by the new economic geography models that are evolving into more broadly based spatial computable general equilibrium models (SCGE models). Results of a recent Dutch application of a new SCGE model with 14 sectors and 548 municipalities on a proposed transrapid (magnetic levitation train) project from Schiphol Airport to Groningen City, confirm that the SCGE approach has a high potential. Moreover, its implementation appeared to be far easier than was expected. Some aspects and outcomes of this recent study will be discussed in more detail. Despite these difficulties, empirical literature has produced some general qualitative outcomes. First and foremost, both SCGE models and potential models show the same spatial pattern of impacts of infrastructure. On an isomorphic plane, investments in line infrastructure (road, rail, air and waterways) produce butterfly type of spatial patterns with diminishing impacts as the butterflies grow larger. Improvements in point infrastructure (terminals and harbours) produce concentric ring impact patterns. Second, there appears to be general agreement on the fact that new infrastructure produces minimal impacts in countries with abundant infrastructure services. This holds with one major exception. When new infrastructure resolves strong capacity limits in either point or line infrastructure, the local effects will be considerable but mostly at the expense of cities and regions close by.";"Jan Oosterhaven,Thijs Knaap,"
"Access: the transport-land use economic link";"3714490189766789671";"1995";"The notion of access has evolved from a physical measure of trip interaction to a more economic concept associated with transport benefits. This paper follows the economic interpretation forward in order to understand the potentiality of access as a consistent economic link between the land use system and the transport system. Consistency is achieved in an economic approach based upon the argument that trips are made only if the benefit derived from making contact with other activities exceeds the transport generalized cost. This framework provides economic measures of access, as evidence of impact on origin and destination of trips, which can be calculated from the analysis of the transport system in some relevant cases. This paper analyses how to calculate measures of access from transport demand models and how to allocate transport benefits to the origin and destination activities. Finally, it describes the use of herein proposed access measures in land use-transport interaction modelling. ?? 1995.";"Francisco J. Mart??nez,"
" Integrated land use and transport modelling. Decision chains and hierarchies";"17928749455960355096";"2005";"The integration of the location of activities in space and the use of transport has been a theoretical planning issue for many years. However, most books on this subject treat each component of the land use and transportation system with different, sometimes even conflicting, theories. The purpose of this book is to present the issue in the light of a single and consistent theoretical framework, that of random utility theory and discrete choice models. This is achieved in a methodical way, reviewing microeconomic theory related to the use of space, spatial interaction models, entropy maximising models, and finally, random utility theory. Emphasis is given to the concepts of decision chains and hierarchies. Spatial input-output models are also discussed, followed by chapters specifically dealing with the location of activities, the land market and the transport system. The book ends with the description of a number of real case studies to show how the theory can be used in practice.";"Tomas de la Barra,"
"Multiagent land-use and transport model for the policy evaluation of a compact city";"14256171076146454580";"2005";"Land-use strategies such as city compaction are the basis for creating livable communities with more accessible land-use patterns that reduce automobile dependency. In previous studies the various advantages of the compact city have been proven, especially from environmental perspectives, but there still remain major questions, such as how the compact city can be induced and whether it can bring a higher quality of life. The authors' main objective in this paper is to answer these questions by using a multiagent land-use transport model to represent the interaction of agents' locations, the effects of mixed land use, and the agglomeration merits or demerits of agents. This model is used to examine the effectiveness of policy measures aimed at achieving a compact city from the viewpoint of urban physical compactness, total trip length, energy consumption, and the social welfare of residents.";"M Kii,K Doi,"
"The first rapid tram line in Poland: How has it affected travel behaviours, housing choices and satisfaction, and apartment prices?";"10078298850924605114";"2016";"The opening of the Poznań Rapid Tram (pol. Poznański Szybki Tramwaj, PST) in the year 1997 symbolically marked the beginning of a new era in the development of urban transportation systems in Poland. In this paper we would like to address the following question: more than one decade after the opening of the PST, what are its effects in terms of travel behaviours, housing choices and satisfaction, and apartment prices? In order to answer this question, we combined data on travel behaviours and housing choices from a survey based on a sample of nearly 300 households with data on housing prices from over 1400 real estate transaction records from the period between 2010 and 2013. Our results show that the proximity to PST affects travel behaviours, as respondents living close to PST stops confirmed that they use this form of transportation more often. There also seems to be some effect on housing choices  in locations close to PST stops we found many households living in rental housing, particularly university students. Also, about 20% of interviewees declared that they would pay more for apartments located closer to the rapid tram. However, that effect was only partly confirmed through the analysis of transaction prices. Using standard and spatial econometric regressions including variables like apartment size, floor number, amenities, and type of building we found a weak correlation between the proximity to PST and apartment prices. In conclusion, we argue that treating property price effects as the main justification for public transportation projects might be a doubtful choice, because in some cases the principal impacts of such projects might be visible in terms of residents' satisfaction and travel behaviours.";"Adam Radzimski,Jędrzej Gadziński,"
"Measuring regional cohesion effects of large-scale transport infrastructure investments: an accessibility approach";"15923103254121616546";"2008";"Cohesion is considered one of the main policy goals both at a EU an national level. However, there is currently a lack of a common approach to measure cohesion effects of large-scale transport infrastructure investments. Accessibility indicators have an unexploited potential in transportation assessment methodologies. Accessibility is considered an added value of locations, which represents one of the elements contributing to a region’s welfare. Therefore, spatial distribution of accessibility may be used as a proxy to assess regional cohesion. This paper suggests an approach consisting in measuring changes in the spatial distribution of four different accessibility indicators, computed and mapped using a GIS support. Cohesion is subsequently measured calculating a set of inequality indices of the resulting accessibility distribution. It is possible then to assess whether disparities in regional accessibility are increased or reduced after the implementation of a new transport infrastructure. This approach is tested assessing regional cohesion effects of road and rail network developments in Spain in the period 1992-2004. Comparing the results obtained with accessibility indicators and inequality indices allows identifying the main critical factors and sources of bias. The conclusion is that for the rode mode, cohesion has improved, while regional disparities have increased for the rail mode.";"Elena López,Gabriel Gómez,Javier Gutiérrez,"
" Impacts on Land Use Characteristics from Fixed Link Projects: Four Case Studies from Norway";"12319656594235031992";"2016";"Abstract Infrastructure projects with large increase in accessibility, often experience over- or underestimation in traffic volume prognosis. This has been the case in several fixed link projects in Norway. Fixed link projects replaces ferry services with a bridge or a tunnel, resulting in large time savings across the fjord. This paper investigates four fixed link projects in Norway. The fixed links connects islands to towns with a population of up to 50.000. This study investigates how land use is affected by the opening of a fixed link. Commuting patterns, population, housing prices and number of companies are analysed with the difference in difference method. Results show a growth due to the fixed link for two of the cases, while the other two experience small or no growth caused by the fixed link. The results indicate that land use changes might appear for islands, which get a fixed link connection to non-urban areas.

"Analysis on evolving model with modular growth of urban roadway network topology structure";"5000116661849661568";"2015";"Purpose ? The purpose of this paper is to explore the evolving mechanism of urban roadway network. With the consideration of self-organization effect and planning effect during evolution, the authors try to demonstrate the impact of preferential attachment, module scale and module structure on the evolving network model. Design/methodology/approach ? The roadway network is built in the form of abstract network by dual approach. By using the evolving model of modular growth, the authors analyze the effects and mechanism of the evolving process. Then through numerical analysis, the impact of evolving effects on urban roadway network topology structure is discussed from the aspects of preferential attachment, module scale and module structure. Findings ? The module structure property, small-world property and scale-free property of roadway network can be affected with various degrees by the change of preferential attachment and module scale. However, the impact of module structure on network properties is small, which can be ignored. Therefore, in practice, the self-organization effect and planning effect of evolving network can be reached by changing the preferential attachment and module scale, so as to generate the network structure with specific properties. Research limitations/implications ? Some local events, such as road extensions, road demolition and intersection rebuilding, exist during the evolving process under real-world situation. While those cases have not been considered in preferential attachment. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to take these factors into consideration in further research. Practical implications ? The paper has implications for practice in urban transportation planning and roadway constructions, which can help to guide the planning of urban roadway and to adjust or restore partial network when broken down according to the evolving law. Originality/value ? The impact of preferential attachment, module scale and module structure on the evolving network model is measured. And the relationship between different network properties can be used to build some patterns of network. From this point of view, the development of urban roadway network can be predicted and intervened.";"Xuecai Xu,Yao Xiao,Peng Liu,Jianzhi Gao,Zhiyun Zou,Saisai Zhou,"
"Impacts on accessibility of China's present and future HSR network";"1497411548457644019";"2014";"Although the construction of China's high-speed rail (HSR) network only started in 2003, the network is already the largest in the world. This paper analyses the impact of the evolving HSR network on the accessibility by HSR and conventional ground transport of 333 prefecture-level cities and 4 municipalities. This paper employs three indicators of accessibility, and analyses three Scenarios. It shows that the HSR network will bring about substantial improvement in accessibility, and lead to national time-space convergence, but will also increase the inequality of nodal accessibility between eastern, central, and western regions, between cities with different sizes of population (excluding the case of the daily accessibility indicator) and between cities that differ in the shortest distance to HSR stations. The HSR network enlarges internal disparities in each of the regions and the five types of cities. The internal inequality of nodal accessibility in all three Scenarios generally increases from the eastern region via the central region to the western region, as well as from very large cities to small cities, varying inversely with the level of economic development and population size. Spatially, accessibility increases generally conform to the distance decay rule but with minor fluctuations. The 50 cities with the largest increases in accessibility are mostly located 50. km or less away from HSR stations and have populations of over 3. million, with the smaller ones located along HSR lines or around large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. As time progresses, the planned HSR network will result in more balanced development, but regional disparities in accessibility will still be greater than before the construction of the HSR.";"Fengjun Jin,Jingjuan Jiao,Jiaoe Wang,Michael Dunford,"
"Mathematics and morphogenesis of cities: A geometrical approach";"11819818561854891580";"2011";"Cities are living organisms. They are out of equilibrium, open systems that never stop developing and sometimes die. The local geography can be compared to a shell constraining its development. In brief, a city's current layout is a step in a running morphogenesis process. Thus cities display a huge diversity of shapes and none of the traditional models, from random graphs, complex networks theory, or stochastic geometry, takes into account the geometrical, functional, and dynamical aspects of a city in the same framework. We present here a global mathematical model dedicated to cities that permits describing, manipulating, and explaining cities' overall shape and layout of their street systems. This street-based framework conciliates the topological and geometrical sides of the problem. From the static analysis of several French towns (topology of first and second order, anisotropy, streets scaling) we make the hypothesis that the development of a city follows a logic of division or extension of space. We propose a dynamical model that mimics this logic and that, from simple general rules and a few parameters, succeeds in generating a large diversity of cities and in reproducing the general features the static analysis has pointed out.";"Thomas Courtat,Catherine Gloaguen,Stephane Douady,"
"Infrastructure in a structural model of economic growth";"12578455509705156720";"1994";"Researchers, commentators, and politicians have devoted steadily more attention to infrastructure in response to claims that inadequate accumulation of public capital has contributed to substandard U.S. economic growth.  Despite this, the link between infrastructure and productivity growth remains controversial.  In this regard, it is somewhat surprising that infrastructure research has developed in isolation from the large literature on economic growth.  We develop a neoclassical growth model that explicitly incorporates infrastructure and is designed to provide a tractable framework within which to analyze the empirical importance of public capital accumulation to productivity growth.  We find little support for claims of a dramatic productivity boost from increased infrastructure outlays.  In a specification designed to provide an upper bound for the influence of infrastructure, we estimate that raising the rate of infrastructure investment would have had a negligible impact on annual productivity growth between 1971 and 1986.";"Amy Ellen Schwartz,Douglas Holtz-Eakin,"
"Distributive effects of new highway infrastructure in the Netherlands: the role of network effects and spatial spillovers";"911562600049741193";"2014";"Network effects and spatial spillovers are intrinsic impacts of transport infrastructure. Network effects imply that an improvement in a particular link in a network generates effects in many other elements of that network, while spillover effects can be defined as those impacts occurring beyond the regions where the actual transport investment is made. These two related effects entail a redistribution of impacts among regions, and their omission from road planning is argued to cause the systematic underestimation of the profitability of transport projects and therefore the public financing they require. However, traditional transport appraisal methodologies fail to consider network and spillover effects. In this study we focus on the spillover impacts of two highway sections planned in the city region of Eindhoven, located in the Dutch province of Noord-Brabant, a region with traffic congestion problems. The new road infrastructure will be financed mainly by national government, the province and the urban region of Eindhoven ('. Stadsregio Eindhoven'), which consists of 21 municipalities. We measure the benefits of the additional links in terms of travel time savings and the accompanying monetary gains. The results show that important spillovers occur in those municipalities close to the new links. The province of Noord-Brabant will benefit the most. We also found important spillovers in the province of Limburg. This latter province will benefit from reduced travel times without contributing financially to the establishment of the analysed new road links. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.";"Tom de Jong,Ana Condeço-Melhorado,Taede Tillema,Rogier Koopal,"
"Multiple‐criteria decision support system in highway infrastructure management";"9673759713056410648";"2008";"Abstract Highway infrastructure represents a significant part of the public assets, and through its lifetime, is exposed to various deterioration processes leading to the depreciation of its value. It is therefore of vital importance to manage these assets aiming to reduce the loss of their value with time to a minimum. A typical task of road managers is making decisions related to maintenance, repair and rehabilitation based on data regarding the existing condition, risk of its use, life cycle costs and age. Road infrastructure is complex, and therefore the optimal choice of planned interventions is a delicate task often left to the road managers? subjective judgment. The main goal of research work presented in the paper is the development of a multiple criteria decision support system to determine the priority ranking of asset rehabilitation projects. Results are presented for a selected case study that consists of 27 overpasses for a highway section. The data on the condition of crossovers obtained by regular inspection along their contribution to a structured database are essential. The selection of the set of asset rehabilitation projects is carried out by using the developed decision support system that includes the budget constraint option. The selected set of asset maintenance/rehabilitation projects meets best the pre?defined combination of several criteria and therefore yields the maximized overall benefit. The results showing the selection criteria employed in the decision process and relative importance are crucial in obtaining the targeted goals. The selected criteria should therefore reflect the needs of the users and the actual conditions related to the assets.";"Jana Šelih,Anžej Kne,Aleksander Srdić,Marjan Žura,"
"Rules for biologically inspired adaptive network design";"17893242022307076992";"2010";"Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks--in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.";"K. Ito,S.

However, at strategic planning levels, a commonly accepted assessment model integrating the sustainability paradigm is still lacking. This work presents a novel contribution to this research line, with the proposal of a multi-criteria assessment model embedded in a GIS. The criteria have been designed covering the three dimensions of sustainability: economic, social, and environmental. This assessment model constitutes an interdisciplinary approach tightly linking network analysis, spatial geography, regional economic, and environmental issues in a GIS-based computer framework.

"Emergence of hierarchy in cost-driven growth of spatial networks";"10466953992640710718";"2013";"One of the most important features of spatial networks--such as transportation networks, power grids, the Internet, and neural networks--is the existence of a cost associated with the length of links. Such a cost has a profound influence on the global structure of these networks, which usually display a hierarchical spatial organization. The link between local constraints and large-scale structure is not elucidated, however, and we introduce here a generic model for the growth of spatial networks based on the general concept of cost-benefit analysis. This model depends essentially on a single scale and produces a family of networks that range from the star graph to the minimum spanning tree and are characterized by a continuously varying exponent. We show that spatial hierarchy emerges naturally, with structures composed of various hubs controlling geographically separated service areas, and appears as a large-scale consequence of local cost-benefit considerations. Our model thus provides the basic building blocks for a better understanding of the evolution of spatial networks and their properties. We also find that, surprisingly, the average detour is minimal in the intermediate regime as a result of a large diversity in link lengths. Finally, we estimate the important parameters for various world railway networks and find that, remarkably, they all fall in this intermediate regime, suggesting that spatial hierarchy is a crucial feature for these systems and probably possesses an important evolutionary advantage.";"Marc Barthelemy,Rémi Louf,Pablo Jensen,"

The planning and routing of Perth's newest passenger railway has been strongly grounded in land use planning with active pursuit of opportunities for transit-oriented development (TOD). This has resulted in different models of integration from TODs designed around walk-on patronage, to TODs designed to calm hostile car-based environments, to transit-transfer stations relying on state transit agency coordination between transport modes to maximize the attractiveness of the public transport travel. This paper examines the opportunities and constraints presented by each model.";"Carey Curtis,"
