AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - A distribution network reconfiguration scheme based on co-evolution algorithm is proposed, which breaks down the distribution network reconfiguration into the optimization of sub-loops and applies the concept of separate evolution under periodic coordination to realize the optimization. The populations same in quantity as the sub-loops are generated and independently evolved with the globally optimal solution as its optimization direction. A specific genetic operation is used to reduce the infeasible solutions for enhancing the optimization efficiency and the "certain tree" is adopted to restore the infeasible solution for avoiding the locally optimal solution. Case study proves its better effect and efficiency.

AB  - The common confusion of land cover and land use in many data sets is problematic for many data integration activities. This article proposes an approach for the separation of land cover and land use based on data primitives. Data primitives are those dimensions that describe at the most fundamental level the processes under investigation. In this case, they provide building blocks that allow land cover and land use to be separated. A series of data primitives were identified from the literature and applied to US National Land Cover Dataset (2001). Mapped outputs, separating the concepts of form (land cover) and function (land use), show the degree of land use, the degree of land cover and locations where the concepts of use and cover are confused. The separation of land cover and land use facilitates the integration of land data for environmental modelling and planning activities. The work promotes the need for land use and land cover to be maintained as distinct concepts in data collection activities.

AB  - Metropolitan areas have come under intense pressure to respond to federal mandates to link planning of land use, transportation, and environmental quality; and from citizen concerns about managing the side effects of growth such as sprawl, congestion, housing affordability, and loss of open space. The planning models used by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) were generally not designed to address these questions, creating a gap in the ability of planners to systematically assess these issues. UrbanSim is a new model system that has been developed to respond to these emerging requirements, and has now been applied in three metropolitan areas. This paper describes the model system and its application to Eugene-Springfield, Oregon. Introduction

AB  - An explosion of multi-lane roundabout projects has recently occurred in Central Ohio. This paper discusses four transportation improvement studies for which multiple multi-lane roundabouts were chosen as the preferred solution. The projects include: 1) a high volume partial cloverleaf interchange design that will include high-capacity roundabouts at the ramp terminal intersections and other intersections within the corridor; 2) a six-mile extension of a suburban/rural four-lane principal arterial that will include six roundabouts along it's length; 3) two closely spaced, high capacity, roundabouts in a densely developed area, near two schools, 4) roundabouts utilized for access improvements in a future office/commercial growth corridor. This paper includes a description of these projects and a discussion of how the choice of multi-lane roundabouts in Transportation planning decisions at these locations will reduce delay and vehicle emissions and air pollution while also improving safety, aesthetics, and access management.

Variables projected concern both land use (e. g. , number of single-family housing units) and choice of transit mode. Forecasts are made for 1990 and 2000 for four spatial zones within San Jose. Delphi panelists are individuals familiar with land use and transportation issues in the San Jose area. A preliminary questionnaire survey is used to set general economic conditions and land use policies that serve as a context for specific forecasts of land use-transportation interactions.

AB  - Estimating transit ridership in tourist corridors is a challenge to transportation planners. This challenge occurs often because there is plenty of anecdotal evidence of travel but little hard data on transit use by visitors. Regional travel forecasting models do not work well in these situations because they are typically used for area-wide analyses, with aggregation of socio-economic data into zones that are large and ill-suited to the specific station-area and ridership analyses that are important to transit planners. This paper provides a description of an innovative process to use parcel-level data in a geographic information system (GIS) to prepare travel forecasts for a transit project in Orlando, Florida. The established four-step transportation process was used - trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and trip assignment - to determine transit travel in the corridor. Travel attractions and productions were identified by parcel in the International Drive Resort Area (IDRA). Trips were distributed to locations external to the study area, within the study area, between station areas, and within station areas of the transit line. Adjustments were made to the forecasts based on ridership elasticity due to travel time and wait time. Sensitivity of ridership to changes in activity in the IDRA were also explored. Several alternatives were studied, with variations of routes, technologies, and numbers of stations evaluated. Satisfactory results were obtained using the transit trip forecasting method, aiding in selecting an appropriate alternative to be advanced into design.

AB  - Scenario analysis of urban dynamics from spatial land use models can support urban, planning and policy. An integrated modeling approach, linking assessment of urban spatial dynamics, was applied to the Santiago Metropolitan Area (SMA). The integrated land use change model combines, a logistic regression model, Markov chain, and cellular automata. This model was calibrated with data, from 1975 to 2010, and was used to make predictions for the years 2030 and 2045, using two datasets of, urban and non-urban explanatory variables. Urban change estimates showed the highest fit during the, model calibration phase. The true-positive proportion and standard Kappa value (κ) were of 99% and, 0.87 respectively when validating against an urban cover reference map from 2010. Urban growth was, equal to +27,000. ha (72%) for the period 1975-2010, and the city of Santiago is projected to, reach approximately 93,000. ha by 2045 (+43% from 2010). In the SMA the most important, urban growth pattern is peri-urban development, referring to widespread boundaries and higher, fragmentation in peripheral municipalities. Predictions for 2030 estimate that ~15% of the projected, urban expansion will occur outside the boundary set by the current Regulatory Plan proposal. These, results demonstrate the capacity of the integrated model to establish comparisons with urban plans, and its utility to explain both the amount and constraints of urban growth. The integrated approach of, urban dynamic assessment using land use modeling is useful for spatiotemporal representation of, distinct urban development forms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The multitude of rights in land and the recording of these rights are addressed by a number of studies, yet a recognized paradigm for such studies seems missing. Rights in land are recorded and managed through either cadastral systems or land administration systems depending on the legal system of the countries concerned. The cadastre, however, is the core of both systems as it provides for systematic and official descriptions of land parcels or real property units. The research mentioned often has a development perspective, and in this article we will motivate the introduction of the research domain of cadastral development. This research is multi-disciplinary and draws on elements of theories and methodologies fromthe natural, the social, the behavioral, and the formal sciences. During the last decade or so, doctoral dissertations have come to constitute a substantial part of this research effort. The article focuses on the methodological aspect of doctoral research by analyzing ten doctoral dissertations. Our analysis is based on a taxonomy ofmethodological elements and aims at identifying commonalities and differences among the dissertations in the use of concepts andmethods. Having completed the main analysis,we invited the authors of the dissertations to comment upon our analysis of their work and the developed taxonomy. The responses corroborate the viewthat the taxonomy could be used for further analyses and provide for a framework for further doctoral research. The article concludes with a call for a shared terminology and a shared set of concepts whichmay contribute to further theory building within the cadastral domain.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the anthropogenic forcing of geomorphic systems, specifically how nineteenth century land-use changes impacted watershed hydrologic, upland erosional, and sediment delivery subsystems of Southern Appalachian headwater catchments. Identification and analysis of the timing and rate of change in these subsystems, and the reestablishment of presettlement conditions, were used to address landscape sensitivity and watershed inheritance issues in a region undergoing population expansion and development. Archival research was used to reconstruct concurrent land-use changes in the catchments of two nineteenth century water-powered mills. Changes in the physical properties of mill pond sediments including, organic content, particle size distribution, and magnetic susceptibility, were used to interpret trends in sediment source during the span of mill operation. Interpolation of augering and coring data was used to determine mill pond sediment mass and pond capacity. Hillslope hydrologic change occurred almost immediately following land conversion. Upland erosion began with the removal of A-horizon fines, and progressed with the removal of A-horizon coarse particulates, and then B-horizon particulates. Change from one source category to another was punctuated by high flow events signifying an integration of human activity and climate in the changing of system boundary conditions

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

The UrbanSim model and the collaborative OPUS framework (Open Platform for Urban Simulation) that it has spawned have stimulated much original progress in this field. The object of this thematic issue of the Journal of Transport and Land Use is to report on this work and to illustrate the various ways UrbanSim has been adapted. However, this special issue is more than just a collection of progress reports. A central theme running through all the papers is that integrated land use-transportation modeling in Europe presents a series of challenges and demands not necessarily present in the United States context in which UrbanSim was developed. Thus, while the UrbanSim system can be technically adapted to European studies given the data and resources, the prevailing land-use transportation environment in Europe differs from the United States.

The city was planned as an integrated structure for living and working. Curitiba was also the fastest-growing city in Brazil during the 1970s, which demonstrates that the above approach has been successful as an effective instrument to control and direct rapid urban growth while contributing to sound environmental management.

AB  - This study developed models that relate trip lengths to the land-use characteristics at the trip ends (both production and attraction ends). Separate models were developed by trip purpose. The results indicate several statistically significant and intuitively reasonable effects of land-use patterns. High residential densities and a good mix of complementary land uses are associated with shorter trips. Larger establishments attract longer trips, and the lengths of home-based other trips decrease with an increase in the number of convenient commercial land- use parcels in the neighborhood. The connectivity provided by the roadway network and the urban form of the area (measured in terms of number of intersections and cul-de-sacs) affect trip lengths. In addition to the local land-use characteristics, trip lengths also vary significantly by the location of the neighborhood within the region. All these results hold even after controlling for several trip and traveler characteristics. The models have been implemented in a spreadsheet program for use in assessing the transportation impacts of new land developments.

AB  - Landscape patterns and processes reflect both natural ecosystem attributes and the policy and management decisions of individual Federal, State, county, and private organizations. Land-use regulation, water management, and habitat conservation and restoration efforts increasingly rely on landscape-level approaches that incorporate scientific information into the decisionmaking process. Since management actions are implemented to affect future conditions, decision-support models are necessary to forecast potential future conditions resulting from these decisions. Spatially explicit modeling approaches enable testing of different scenarios and help evaluate potential outcomes of management actions in conjunction with natural processes such as climate change. The ability to forecast the effects of changing land use and climate is critically important to land and resource managers since their work is inherently site specific, yet conservation strategies and practices are expressed at higher spatial and temporal scales that must be considered in the decisionmaking process.

Specifically, an idealized abstract example of the interactions between two homogeneous regions was studied with respect to various issues related to land use and transportation planning. The study took the form of systems of simple differential equations. Each equation represents the rate of change of either the land use or the transportation condition of a region. Investigation with the two-region model suggested a possibility of spatial and temporal fluctuations under certain planning conditions. By examining the conditions underlying the model equations, planning and developmental practices that may cause system instabilities were identified and discussed.

AB  - Cooperative work now routinely spans organizational, geographical and other boundaries. Objects and tasks also increasingly have ready access to one another (increasing reach). These trends pose important problems for analyzing and supporting coordination among tasks. Thinking about coordination has focused on articulation, i.e., making sure that everything needed to accomplish a task is available and functioning. Coordination mechanisms (brackets) are forms and procedures used to reduce the complexity of articulation work; that is, rationalize it by making parts work together smoothly. But increasing reach requires a distinction between metawork (the work of organizing work) and local articulation (the work of making sure that everything needed in the immediate situation is in place).  This in turn leads to an additional problem in analyzing coordination. Coordination trades off against standardization and segregation of tasks, because these latter processes reduce opportunities to make use of specialized local circumstances. Hence they make local articulation more problematical. At the same time, they make metawork simpler by making it possible to recombine and superimpose tasks in many ways with abstract protocols such as TCP/IP, XML and the services that rest upon it. In this sense, segregation and standardization potentiate many new ways of coordinating tasks, even as they undercut the old ones. For example, ready availability of airline flight information via the Internet facilitates the work of hotels, car rentals, limousines, and other services that coordinate with airline operations.  Local articulation tasks present a different set of coordination problems. Customization in some form is needed to tie abstract protocols to local circumstances. In addition, the lack of authoritative control across organiza2 tional, geographical, and jurisdictional boundaries means that a variety of reconciliation mechanisms are needed to ensure efficiency, efficacy and equity. I discuss three such mechanisms: cross-cutting ties among personal networks, participant review (e.g., elections and peer review), and patronage. The paper concludes by suggesting that CSCW efforts should focus on methods and tools for making customization and reconciliation easier.

AB  - Integrated land use transportation models have been evolved as the primary metropolitan planning vehicle in the last several decades as the world development and urbanization continues. Urban regions continue planning for development of their urbanized areas using these modeling processes. Land use/demographic forecasting models provide the main input for the travel demand models, yet until recently the rigorous application of such models in the integrated land use transportation process was scanty except for the largest metropolitan areas. Such models require consideration of environmental factors and modeling of metropolitan economic systems. Theoretical and technological advancement of the last few decades has instigated a new wave of attention, research and further developments of the models and techniques from a variety of disciplines. This article briefly discusses the advancements and provides a guideline for their future improvements. It also discusses importance of role of national government and legislative mandates in ascertaining quality of planning process by reviewing some excerpts from U.S. legislation.

AB  - The relationships between land use and biodiversity are fundamental to understanding the links between people and their environment. Biodiversity can be measured in many ways. The concept covers not only the overall richness of species present in a particular area but also the diversity of genotypes, functional groups, communities, habitats and ecosystems there. As a result, the relationships between biodiversity in its broadest sense and land use can be complex and highly context dependent. Moreover, the relationships between them are often two-way, so that simple relationships between cause and effect can be difficult to identify. In some places, specific land uses or land management practices may be important in sustaining particular patterns of biodiversity. Elsewhere, the uses to which land can be put are highly dependent on the biodiversity resources present. The review will consider how changes in the quantity, quality and spatial configuration of different aspects of land use can impact on different components of biodiversity, and what direct and indirect factors might drive these changes. The need to distinguish between land cover and land use will be discussed in relation to the economic and social drivers of land use change. The review will also consider whether framing biodiversity objectives involves society in placing constraints upon the types of land use and management practice that are possible, and will consider such arguments in relation to assessments of the costs of biodiversity loss. It would seem that while considerable progress has been made in mapping out plausible futures for land use and biodiversity at global and regional scales, closer integration of modelling, scenario and field-based monitoring is needed to strengthen the evidence base available to decision makers. Challenges that face us include how we take account of the qualitative changes in land cover, and the impacts of such modifications on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Broader perspectives on the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services are also needed as the basis for developing adaptive and flexible approaches to policy and management. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationships between land use and climate change. It explores how land use decisions will be affected by future changes in the climate, but also the feedbacks from land use change to the global climate system through greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. Past changes in land use were characterised by decreasing areas of agricultural use and increasing areas of forested and urbanised land. This has led to UK land use being a net sink for GHGs, mostly due to forestation. However, existing forests have on average passed their age for maximum net removals of carbon from the atmosphere. In the next decade at least, net removals from UK forests are likely to decrease significantly.\n\nLonger term scenarios of future land use change are consistent in their expectation of further declines in the agricultural area used for food production – offset to some extent by increased bioenergy cropping – along with increases in forested and urban areas. These trends are broadly consistent with the observed past land use change, but are calculated from various assumptions about future changes in drivers rather than by extrapolation from the past. Socio-economic and technological changes are likely to be the most important drivers for land use, with climate change having a smaller influence. The land use changes represented in these scenarios would likely reduce GHG emissions and enhance carbon sinks. These trends would be reinforced by small future changes in the climate, but large climatic changes are likely to cause net GHG fluxes to switch from being a sink to a source. Land use change will also be moderated by potential policy goals that seek to reduce GHG emissions from land and/or increase the size of land-based sinks. This includes strategies to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions through increased efficiency, afforestation and biofuel production.

It examines the interest in the potential of model development plan policies as a device to enhance the efficiency of the land use planning system, and explores the role of the various communities of interest who assert a stake in policy design. This paper considers the land use policy subjects that are perceived as having potential for expression in model policy form, and distinguishes between environmental, developmental and procedural. It considers the implications for the policy making process, and, particularly, for those involved in policy design. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The last two decades have witnessed the implementation of various policies based on land-use to address problems stemming from automobile ownership and use. There are, however, questions with respect to the ecacy of such policies. This paper therefore reviews the literature on empirical studies of the transportation ±land-use interaction with the objective of identifying the current state of knowledge concerning the interactions, particularly with respect to the impact land-use policies are likely to have on the system. The focus is on studies conducted in North America. The results are mixed; some studies conclude that urban densities, traditional neighborhood design schemes, and land-use mix have an impact on auto ownership and use. Other studies ®nd the impact of such variables to be at best marginal. Gaps in our understanding of the interaction are identi®ed. These are found to be primarily the result of data limitations and methodological weaknesses. A detailed discussion of the implications of the ®ndings for the development and application of integrated transportation±land-use models is provided, with the recommendation that without such an integrated approach to analyzing the transportation±land-use interaction, any study of impacts of urban form on travel behavior is likely to yield erroneous results.

AB  - This paper describes the use of parcel-level data in the development of UrbanSim, the Oregon Prototype Metropolitan Land Use Model, and its application to the Eugene-Springfield Metropolitan Area 4, The exploding use of Geographic Information Systems to map and manage tax parcel databases is a widely noted trend, but these massive databases have yet to be fully exploited in the development of new land use and transportation models. This paper explores a case study in the exploitation of a parcel-level GIS database in Lane County, and its integration with a business establishment inventory, to develop an internally consistent disaggregate database for use in calibrating the Oregon Prototype Metropolitan Land Use Model, The focus of the paper is on the challenges involved in using data of this level of spatial detail, and on the analysis that has been done to develop these data for use in the land use model.

AB  - The precise relationship between transportation and land use continues to elude us. It seems self-evident that transportation facilities and services have enormous effects on land use patterns. We've all observed developments occur around freeway interchanges, and we all know the history of automobile-oriented suburban development. However, when we look beyond broad generalizations, we see far more complex and uncertain relationships, as well as a cluster of unsubstantiated beliefs.

AB  - This paper deals with a specific issue in project marketing, namely project co-development, presented as a relational and cooperative form of exchange in the project network. It endeavours to find out under what conditions project co-development is considered as a viable marketing strategy as opposed to competitive bidding. A model is developed, which is then used to analyze two cases of project co-development in the construction industry. Of the two cases, one is a successful case and the other is a failure case. This enabled us to analyze factors and conditions that can lead to a successful co-development strategy. Factors such as, project complexity, conflicting objectives, lack of compatibility, lack of trust and commitment and lack of coherence between the budget and the objectives turned out to influence a co-development strategy. The role played by the key decision-makers (project manager) also influenced the success/failure of co-development strategy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to additional trip production by land use development, the O-D travel costs between some O-D pairs may also change intuitively. This leads to positive and negative impacts on network users traveling between different O-D pairs. Therefore the equity issue about the benefit distribution gained from the land-use development problem is raised. This paper proposes an Equity based Land-Use Transportation Problem (ELUTP) which is intended to examine the benefit distribution among the network users and the resulting equity associated with land-use development problem in terms of the change of equilibrium O-D travel cost. In the resulting bi-level programming model, the upper level sub-problem maximizes traffic production incorporating equity constraints, while the lower level sub-problem is a combined trip distribution/assignment user equilibrium problem. Genetic algorithm based method is applied to test the models using an example network.

AB  - A comprehensive study of static transportation network optimization\nproblems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints is presented. It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters. Accordingly, it can\nbe concluded that the proposed unified bilevel programming model, which\ncan characterize transportation network optimization problems subject to\nstochastic user equilibrium constraints, is a smooth optimization\nproblem. In addition, the study presents a single-level continuously\ndifferentiable optimization formulation that is equivalent to the\nunified bilevel programming model. Furthermore, as a unified solution\nmethod, a successive quadratic programming algorithm based on the\nsensitivity analysis method is used to solve the transportation network\noptimization problems with stochastic user equilibrium constraints.\nFinally, two examples are used to demonstrate the proposed models and\nalgorithm.

AB  - This working paper serves as an introductory reference for those studying the application of land- use–transportation models to the simulation of urban systems. The paper is by no means comprehensive, but aims to provide the reader with a foundation in the basic principles underlying land-use–transportation models and to set those principles in the context of urban management and urban studies. The paper opens with taxonomy of urban simulation models and a treatment of descriptive and analytical models. This serves to situate land-use–transportation models in the context of a broader simulation environment. The paper then reviews land-use–transportation models according to their simulation techniques and individual components. Towards the second half of the paper, the discussion moves to a critical overview of urban simulation and deals with model weaknesses and strengths in a holistic fashion, before concluding with a discussion of some innovations in academic research that are likely to shape future models.

AB  - Data on land use change in the UK and its consitutent nations is variable in scope and quality, but has improved in recent years. It shows that the popular image of cities spreading across the countryside is a false one. In fact most new housing is built within existing settlements or in small rural developments, whilst more crop and grazing land has been turned over to woodland in the past 25 years than into housing. It also shows that market forces, taxes and subsidies have a rapid effect on land use decisions by developers, farmers and others, for example on what type of housing to build, what crops to grow and whether to turn farmland into woodland.

AB  - The Institute of Transport Studies has developed a Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator (TRESIS) as a decision support system to assist planners to predict the impact of transport strategies and to make recommendations based on those predictions. A key focus of the simulator is the richness of policy instruments such as new public transport, new toll roads, congestion pricing, gas guzzler taxes, changing residential densities, introducing designated bus lanes, implementing fare changes, altering parking policy, introducing more flexible work practices, and the introduction of more fuel efficient vehicles. The appropriate- ness of mixtures of policy instruments is gauged in terms of a series of performance indicators such as impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, accessibility, equity, air quality and household consumer surplus. In this paper we introduce TRESIS to the research community, focussing on the structure of the system and the diversity of applications. Applications are presented to illus- trate the diversity and richness of TRESIS as a policy advisory tool.

It will be run in iteration with the California statewide travel model to evaluate major transportation improvement scenarios, such as freeway widenings and high speed rail. In addition, we will evaluate land use policies intended to provide for more affordable housing and for habitat protection. This model is uniquely capable of providing performance measures for total travel, travel delay, mode shares, economic development, wages, economic welfare, economic equity, rents paid by households and firms, energy use in vehicles and buildings, greenhouse gas emissions, vehicular air pollution, loss of agricultural lands, habitat loss, and erosion potential. We propose a framework for interpreting all of these data, based on recent advances in the theory of well-being for persons and for nations.

AB  - Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) Insurance, or mileage-based insurance, has the potential to be an effective transportation pricing strategy with multiple benefits including reductions in vehicle miles traveled, fuel consumption, and vehicle emissions. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), in partnership with Progressive County Mutual Insurance Company (Progressive), conducted a pilot program to evaluate the feasibility of implementing mileage-based insurance and whether such a program would impact driver behavior. During the first phase of the study, a statistical analysis of available data produced a positive correlation between mileage driven and accident frequency, thus validating the hypothesis that insurance companies can provide financial incentives to customers who drive fewer miles because of an associated reduction in claims costs. A second phase of the pilot program offered financial incentives to volunteer participants who were able to reduce their mileage from a personal baseline condition. Data collected from the participants' vehicle on-board diagnostic system resulted in an average mileage reduction of five percent. Additional spatial analysis concluded that mileage reduction was independent of participant residence suggesting PAYD Insurance would be a viable strategy to minimize negative environmental impacts region-wide. © ASCE.

AB  - This study is a contribution to an exercise to construct land use change scenarios for Europe as part of the European Commission funded ATEAM (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) project. The purpose of the study is to examine recent trends in land use change as they relate to forests in the pre-enlargement European Union member countries, Switzerland and Norway, and to construct narratives and preliminary quantitative estimates of future trends in forest land use that are consistent with the four storylines presented by the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). These storylines describe different types of future worlds during the 21st century defined according to societal values (ranging between consumerist/individualist and community-minded values) and according to scales of governance (between globalised and localised). Several quantitative scenarios are associated with each storyline. The analysis indicates a continuous growth of forest area in most parts of Europe in recent years, with an average annual increase of about 0.3 percent. For the future, the study estimates decreasing forest area in the consumer-orientated worlds and slightly accelerated area growth rates in the community-orientated worlds. The scenarios are at a national scale, and could not be used directly as projections on the regular geographical grid employed in ATEAM. Rather, they were intended to serve as reliability or consistency checks for more comprehensive scenarios incorporating urban and agricultural land uses, protected areas and biofuels, constructed within the project. A firm conclusion of the study is that national forest policies currently play a central role in determining future land use in Europe. Future work on scenario development will require a comprehensive framework that integrates policies as key driving forces of land use change.

Here we have a system that not only resembles a system with physical analogues of nodes and links, but also one that very much behaves like a system. In some respects it is closer to an organism than it is to a machine. It tells a fascinating and timely story about evolution and co-evolution, about complexity and emergence, and about how users and technology have become woven into a single entity. It also allows us to try systems concepts developed in other disciplines for size and to contemplate the future role of civil engineering. Systems thinking will mean that society will be looking for small, clever, user-centred interventions which yield disproportionately beneficial effects as much as ‘grand gestures’ that sometimes fail to meet them. The Grid is an 80-year-old civil and electrical engineering exemplar whose systemic success is taken for granted.

Third, shakeouts in patent specialisations in leading cities are less dramatic compared to those in lagging cities. Fourth, invention activities among cities co-evolve.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay. ?? 2006.

AB  - Based on the theories of the information entropy of urban land use structure, co-integration and error correction model, this thesis analyses the relationship between economic growth, urbanization level and the information entropy of urban land use structure. The information entropy values of China's urban land use structure from 1981 to 2004 have been calculated in this paper. The relationship between China's GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is investigated in details. The results indicate a co-integration relationship between GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure. However, there is no co-integration relationship between urbanization and the information entropy of urban land use structure. On the basis of the above analyses, the error correction model on GDP and the information entropy of urban land use structure is instituted. The application of the model shows that every 1% decrease in the information entropy value of urban land use structure demands a 59.53% growth in GDP. Because of the existing co-integration relationship between the economic growth and the information entropy of urban land use structure, the order degree of China's urban land use structure has relied heavily on the economic growth for a long time. The economic growth will significantly affect the optimal regulation of urban land use structure in the future. Further investigation also shows that economic growth and urbanization act as the direct driving force of the optimization of urban land use structure, but the optimization of urban land use structure can't promote the economic growth and the urbanization. Therefore, it becomes a very pressing strategic issue to adjust the economic structure and industrial distribution to optimize the distribution of urban land use and to optimize the structure of urban land use to improve the efficiency and promote the socio-economic development.

This paper introduces the Sequenced Activity-Mobility Simulator (SAMS), a dynamic and integrated microsimulation forecasting system for transportation, land use and air quality, designed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional four-step travel demand forecasting systems. The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected exter- nally to be input into the forecasting process.

AB  - This research examines how representational gestures (Kita 2000), made by scientists during collaborative discussion in a biochemistry lab, are used in formulating scientific theory. By analyzing digital video of lab meetings and interviews, we find that representational gestures are frequently used to reference, modify, and embody portions of existing material structure such as models, diagrams, and graphs. Representational gestures appear to play a significant role in how scientists both conceptualize and communicate theories. We believe that representational gestures operate as instantiations of essential spatio-dynamic features that are not efficiently conveyed in other modalities, like language and graphical representations, and, as such, are essential resources for shaping theoretical understandings when used in collaborative, face-to-face activity. Gestures may also serve to align cognitive processes in a “community of practice” (Lave 1991) and can package theoretical conjectures into a single semiotic form that can be used symbolically to evoke a rich, shared conceptual history. We use a theoretical framework provided by distributed cognition and embodied cognition to examine jointly shared representational gestures as cognitive artifacts produced and modified by the biochemistry lab community during the practice of theory construction.

AB  - One way to cope with the increasing demand in transporta- tion networks is to integrate standard solutions with more intelligent measures. This paper discusses the effects of inte- grating co-evolving decision-making regarding route choices (by drivers) and control measures (by traffic lights) We use microscopic modeling and simulation, in opposition to the classical network analysis. General questions here are whether co-evolution pays off, and, if so, what kind of evolutionary approach shall be used. This is challenging for networks other than the two-route one due to the complexity of route- choice behavior, as well as control strategies by the traffic lights. Moreover, the more agents, the less effective learn- ing strategies are, especially when the integration among them depicts complex interelationships. The approach was tested in different scenarios using centralized and decentral- ized methods.

AB  - The objective is to assess the ability of land use transportation models to address some current policy issues. The nature of the relationship between land use and transportation is examined briefly in terms of empirical evidence and the results from modeling exercises. Two studies that the use of such models and that are being carried out in Britain are examined. Despite these and some convincing arguments by expers, there is little evidence of widespread use of such models. A number of current policy issues are discussed, and then a set of policy instruments that can be used to meet the policy objectives are identified. Evidence on the ability of land use transportation models to represent the impacts of the policy instruments is presented. It is shown how such models can contribute significantly in some areas of policy analsys, for example, reducing congestion and energy use, but can contribute very little to the objective of moving toward a market economy.

AB  - This paper describes a series of tests carried out with a comprehensive transportation, land use and air quality simulation system, which has been designed for planning application at the metropolitan or regional scale, within the framework of the U.S. Government's Clean Air legislation. The urban location portion of the system was developed at the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of S. H. Putman. The air quality sections incorporate models formulated in earlier studies. The system was tested with data from the San Francisco Bay area, for the period 1975–1980. The test policies included changes in regional transportation costs and population totals; local interventions in the transportation network; and controls on pollutant emissions from mobile and stationary sources. To assess net impacts, the outcomes predicted for each policy were compared with the outcomes predicted in a “benchmark”, or base run of the system. The tests showed that the system is sensitive to a broad range of air quality policies, and that it is capable of predicting important air quality consequences of transportation and land use policies. Some further development will be needed before the system can be used in practical planning situations, but there is little doubt as to the soundness of its central theoretical constructs and logical structure.

AB  - Land use/cover change (LUCC) is one of the most concerned environmental problems by scientists, land managers and policy makers. LUCC can affect energy flow, biogeochemical and hydrological cycling in terrestrial ecosystems through altering land surface and species composition. Ecosystem carbon cycling responds differently to various LUCC types, showing a pattern of CO2 release into the atmosphere when LUCC from a high-biomass forest to low-biomass grassland, cropland or urban area. Previous reports indicated that global terrestrial ecosystem released 2.21 Pg C (1 Pg C=1015 g C) per year induced by LUCC during the 1990s, which explains about 25% of the global C emission per year in the same period; and in the last two centuries, the released C from LUCC accounts for 50% of the C emission from fossil fuel combustion. The LUCC patterns are totally diversified for regions around the world, which cause obviously different C fluxes among them. The reports showed that LUCC in the tropics is a C source, while it is a C sink in the middle and high latitude regions in the northern hemisphere, which possibly explain a large part of the "missing carbon sink" in the terrestrial ecosystems. Currently, modelling is the most popular way to simulate LUCC-induced changes in ecosystem C cycling. The quantitative relationship between LUCC patterns and their related processes and ecosystem carbon cycling remains uncertain. This uncertainty causes great discrepancies in the estimation of terrestrial ecosystem CO2 fluxes from land use/cover changes. In the near future, except for carrying on long-term experiments to determine these quantitative relationships, model development by integrating LUCC with vegetation dynamic model and ecosystem process model will be essential for making an accurate estimation of C fluxes induced by LUCC. Sound land management can greatly increase C storage in the terrestrial ecosystems during LUCC processes. However, the quantification of land management effects is not well-established yet and land management is thus not included in most simulation models of LUCC impacts, which needs more researches in the future.

AB  - In Virginia, off-network, or local network, VMT calculations are performed based on counts taken as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) program. A regional average VMT is calculated based on counts taken at a number of region-wide locations, This VMT average is then applied to overall local road lengths to calculate the local network VMT. This calculation method has been approved by the EPA for use in Air Quality Conformity analysis. The off-network VMT calculated with this method was found to be 22 percent of total VMT for the Hampton Roads non-conforming region. Geographical Information System (GIS) analysis tools were used to identify issues that would cause an inflated off-network calculation. Analysis included determining whether the data derived from these count sites represented regional average travel. The methods employed included an identification of regional land use averages, a determination of whether network roads were double counted, and analysis of whether count site locations were representative of average, local road characteristics, The issues identified by this analysis resulted in a recalculation of off-network VMT using a smaller portion of the previously used HPMS count data which more accurately represented regional averages. This recalculation resulted in a 45 percent reduction in the off-network VMT,value used for air conformity. The paper outlines some of the drawbacks of using HPMS data to derive off-network VMT values and identifies a number of issues that may be inflating these values in other areas of the country.

AB  - Although there are only a limited number of rigorous research papers focussed specifically on land use perceptions, there is an extensive literature on: environmental attitudes in general and urban growth in particular, as well as on the land use perceptions of farmers and on public perceptions about the use of land for the production of food and raw materials. A number of key themes emerge. First, the urban public are resistant to urban growth and have an ingrained and deep attachment to 'traditional' and romanticised visions of rural land use. Second, farmers, the main managers of land use, have proved resistant to concepts of multifunctional land use. Third, there is a perception gap between the practice of food production as a damaging land use exercise and consumer ignorance about the realities of how food and other raw materials are produced. However, consumers support the ideas of farmers being paid to use their land in a more environmentally friendly way. Fourth, there is a value-action gap between people's perceptions of the land use damage they are doing and their lack of willingness to actually change their behaviours. The drivers behind these perceptions are likely to change as carbon reduction policies begin to impact. So the paper concludes with a discussion about future perceptions and possible behavioural change. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - This article examines the changes that occurred in the rail network and density of population in London during the 19th and 20th centuries. It aims to disentangle the ‘chicken and egg’ problem of which came first, network or land development, through a set of statistical analyses clearly distinguishing events by order. Using panel data representing the 33 boroughs of London over each decade from 1871 to 2001, the research finds that there is a positive feedback effect between population density and network density. Additional rail stations (either Underground or surface) are positive factors leading to subsequent increases in population in the suburbs of London, while additional population density is a factor in subsequently deploying more rail. These effects differ in central London, where the additional accessibility produced by rail led to commercial development and concomitant depopulation. There are also differences in the effects associated with surface rail stations and Underground stations, as the Underground was able to get into central London in a way that surface rail could not. However, the two networks were weak (and statistically insignificant) substitutes for each other in the suburbs, while the density of surface rail stations was a complement to the Underground in the center, though not vice versa.

AB  - Marginal land provides an alternative potential for food and bioenergy production in the face of limited land resources; however, effective assessment of marginal lands is not well addressed. Concerns over environmental risks, ecosystem services and sustainability for marginal land have been widely raised. The objective of this study was to develop a hierarchical marginal land assessment framework for land use planning and management. We first identified major land functions linking production, environment, ecosystem services and economics, and then classified land resources into four categories of marginal land using suitability and limitations associated with major management goals, including physically marginal land, biologically marginal land, environmentally ecologically marginal land, and economically marginal land. We tested this assessment framework in southwestern Michigan, USA. Our results indicated that this marginal land assessment framework can be potentially feasible on land use planning for food and bioenergy production, and balancing multiple goals of land use management. We also compared our results with marginal land assessment from the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and land capability classes (LCC) that are used in the US. The hierarchical assessment framework has advantages of quantitatively reflecting land functions and multiple concerns. This provides a foundation upon which focused studies can be identified in order to improve the assessment framework by quantifying high-resolution land functions associated with environment and ecosystem services as well as their criteria needed to improve the assessment framework. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This article reviews empirical studies of the relationship between transportation facilities—highways, heavy rail, and light rail transit systems—and property values. The main ob- jective is to develop an explanation for inconsistent results presented in this literature over the past several decades. Results from these studies vary based on whether travel time or travel distance is used as a measure of accessibility. When researchers measure access to highways and rail transit in terms of travel time, study results usually indicate the expected inverse relationship between access to transportation facilities and property values. When studies use travel distance as a measure of access to transportation facilities, results tend to show mixed property value effects. The delineation of study areas also appears to influence the direction of results. This article offers a new interpretation of the transportation facility-property value literature that improves our ability to measure this relationship and to anticipate land-market responses to transportation facilities.

It is shown that separate sensitivity analysis procedures for a land use model with exogenous travel costs and a transportation network with elastic demand can be combined to get a sensitivity analysis procedure for the integrated model. Sensitivity-analysis-based techniques can then be used for the optimal design of land use plans and transportation policies so that certain social surplus functions are optimized.

AB  - Impact fees have become a common funding mechanism for growth-related transportation improvements. The most common impact fee program includes a range of street and road projects, the cost of which are partially paid by new development based upon their usage of these facilities. The purpose of this paper is to describe an innovative application of impact fees to pay for transit and nonmotorized improvements in Portland OR. The City of Portland initiated a study of System Development Charges, or SDC's to help pay for growth impacts on a variety of multimodal facilities. The city is largely built-out with respect to roads, but has an aggressive program to improve transit and nonmotorized facilities. The City and a consultant team developed several innovative methods to attribute the impacts of growth to projects such as corridor-level transit facilities, sidewalks, bike lanes, and a downtown streetcar system. Special steps were needed to convert the traditional ITE vehicle trip generation rates into comparable rates for the transit and nonmotorized modes. The paper details the methodology, analysis techniques, and assumptions required. In addition, the paper describes the steps used to gain acceptance of the controversial impact fee program by a diverse group of citizens and business interests.

AB  - Land use and transportation are linked by complex, yet identifiable, relationships. Tools are needed to formalize this relationship and to take it into account when decisions are made about urban and suburban transportation systems. This paper reviews foundational concepts of performance measures of metropolitan transportation systems. It offers a rationale for the types of tools needed to measure and assess land use and transportation system efficiency. One tool being developed by the Washington State Department of Transportation-the Transportation-Efficient Land Use Mapping Index (TELUMI)-illustrates how research findings can be applied in metropolitan transportation planning. TELUMI uses cartographic modeling (CM) techniques and parcel-level geographic information system data. The fine resolution of the data measures microscaled land use conditions associated with travel patterns in built-up areas. CM generates maps of zones in a region that match land use conditions with travel behaviors. Zones are defined by land use variables, such as density of activities, presence and agglomeration of destinations, block size, and transportation infrastructure attributes. CM also performs advanced quantitative analyses of map attributes, and it is effective with lay and professional audiences. TELUMI's use of individual land use variables makes it possible to target intervention strategies, such as augmenting density or building sidewalks, and to evaluate their effectiveness in improving transportation efficiency. TELUMI assists transportation and local planning authorities in allocating transportation investments appropriate to multimodal travel.

AB  - In densely populated areas, space for development is confined, making spatial planning essential to reconcile the interests of all stakeholders. In the process of policymaking, possible future land-use scenarios are often very valuable as a reference point, but the optimal configuration in terms of costs and effects might provide even more valuable inputs when decisions have to be taken. Tools for exploring optimal land-use configurations are therefore of great interest to policymakers. With these tools, plans can be evaluated and adjusted. Spatial optimisation is a powerful method to explore the potentials of a given area to improve the spatial coherence of land-use functions. In the Netherlands, there are many different planning issues in which multi-objective spatial optimisation can play an important role.

AB  - Exposure to air pollution has become an exceedingly inescapable part of urban living. The presence of pollutants in urban air is reported to cause adverse effects on human health, as as damage to structures and materials. Their presence can also be an aesthetic nuisance around urban centres. Modelling of urban air pollution is an important facet of pollution control and abatement. Models explain the occurrence, Intensity, and movement of pollutants. Current techniques used for modelling urban air pollution use dispersion characteristics to predict pollutant levels at locations away from defined sources. They work well in relatively simple situations with few sources in consideration. However, these models cannot handle the mathematics in an airshed with many point and non-point sources of urban air pollutants, This is because many simplifying assumptions have to be made, which limit the accuracy of predictions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling is a technique that offers many advantages in modelling non-linear type processes Such as those that govern complex urban air pollution situations. This technique uses historical data sets and can recognize the patterns that occur between different pollutants the urban airshed. ANN modelling is a "black-box" method, where equations describing the complex situations are not known or required. The model simply extrapolates patterns, and "learns" based on historical data, much the same,way: the human mind learns. Therefore, ANN may be suitable for air pollution modelling of situations where the governing equations are too complex or expensive to derive. This paper describes the use of ANN to predict behavior of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within a defined region of the City of Edmonton, Alberta.

It focuses on bilateral and multilateral development agencies. Since the first compilation exercise was carried out in 2001, the ICT for development landscape has changed in a number of ways that are well reflected in the survey findings, including: * most donors have now developed a strategy not only to use ICT for development within their existing and new programmes but also to integrate ICT within their own agencies to improve the way they deliver their development programmes * strategies are shaped by long-term experience in the field of ICT for development, pilot projects or by in-depth studies. They are guided by the needs of developing countries, particularly the priorities identified in the Millennium Declaration * ICTs are considered in the broad sense, encompassing both traditional, old technologies (radio, television) and high technologies (Internet, mobile phones) and some donors emphasise the interest of combining both new and old technologies to maximise benefits * ICTs are in most cases seen as tools to help meet development objectives and not as a separate sector. Some donors also underline the need to create an enabling environment as a prerequisite for effective and efficient use of ICTs as tools for development. For those donors, investment in telecommunications infrastructure and the creation of the necessary technological, legal, regulatory and human framework remains a priority * in all cases, donors put ICT to the service of the achievement of their broader strategic objectives. The focus is on meeting objectives not on technology per se * donors’ guiding principles for use of ICT for development emphasise respect for national ownership and that support should be demand-driven, encouraging and assisting developing country governments to formulate their own ICT development strategies. When developing countries decide to harness ICT for development, some donors recommend that those developing country governments include their ICT for development strategy in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) * most donors have built their ICT for development strategy on partnerships involving a number of actors from other bilateral and multilateral agencies, ministries (communications, education…), civil society, the private sector, universities and research institutions The difficulty in identifying or quantifying the ICT component of projects might be the clearest demonstration that most donors have indeed mainstreamed ICT in their development programmes. However, it is estimated that: * there has not been a significant increase in funding for ICT since 2001 * that the amount directly for ICT, including to the telecommunications sector, remains well short of $1 billion

AB  - The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land-use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality

AB  - In this paper, two research approaches to specify the relation between land use types and their explanatory factors are applied to the same modelling framework. The two approaches are used to construct land suitability maps, which are used as inputs in two model applications. The first is an inductive approach that uses regression analysis. The second applies a theoretical, actor decision framework to derive relations deductively using detailed field data. Broadly speaking, this classification coincides with the distinction between empirical and theoretical models and the distinction between deriving process from pattern and pattern from process. The two modelling approaches are illustrated by a scenario analysis for a case study in a municipality in the Philippines. Goodness-of-fit of the deductive approach in predicting current land use is slightly lower compared to the inductive approach. Resulting land use projections from the modelling exercise for the two approaches differ in 15 percent of the cells, which is caused by differences in the specification of the suitability maps. The paper discusses the assumptions underlying the two approaches as well as the implications for the applicability of the models in policy-oriented research. The deductive approach describes processes explicitly and can therefore better handle discontinuities in land use processes. This approach allows the user to evaluate a wide range of scenarios, which can also include new land use types. The inductive approach is easily reproducible by others but cannot guarantee causality. Therefore, the inductive approach is less suitable to handle discontinuities or additional land use types, but is well able to rapidly identify hotspots of land use change. It is concluded that both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks for different purposes. Generally speaking, the inductive approach is applicable in situations with relatively small land use changes, without introduction of new land use types, whereas the deductive approach is more flexible. The choice of modelling approach should therefore be based on the research and policy questions for which it is used. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The urgency of the environmental debate has renewed the interest in the application of integrated models of urban land use and transportation. In the United States new legislation inspired by growing environmental awareness such as the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 requires that transportation planning must consider the interaction between transportation and land use in a consistent fashion – as it can be done only by land-use transportation models. However, this new interest in land use models also presents new challenges to the land use modelling community. A new generation of activity-based travel models and new neighborhoodscale transportation planning policies require more detailed information on household demographics and employment characteristics and the location of activities. Moreover, the models need to be able to predict not only economic but also environmental impacts of land-use transportation policies. Today there exist several operational urban land-use transportation models which have the potential to respond to these challenges. At the same time there exist exciting opportunities to incorporate new theoretical developments and methodologies into the field. The paper reviews the current state of the art of operational land-use transportation models using criteria such as comprehensiveness, overall structure, theoretical foundations, modeling techniques, dynamics, data requirements, calibration and validation, operationality and applicability and evaluates their suitability with respect to the new requirements and speculates about the most promising avenues to further improvement and diffusion of this kind of model.

AB  - Land use and land cover are important determinants of the state of the natural environment. As a result, measures of land use and land cover change have been widely used as indicators of environmental condition and quality. This review explores the range of measures that have been applied in the UK at national, regional and local scales, and their sensitivity to particular drivers of change. The extent to which these indicators are important properties in themselves or are surrogates for wider environmental qualities is considered. The discussion focuses on the evolving frameworks used to analyse the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment. The limitations and strengths of the DPSIR reporting and analytical framework are explored. Recent approaches to the assessment of the impacts of future land use change on the natural environment using model-based scenario methods are examined, and the need to develop new types of aggregate measure of land use function is identified. There is also a pressing need to link assessments of trends to the analysis of sustainability thresholds or limits. It is concluded that the concept of a socio-ecological system offers a more fruitful approach to the analysis of the relationships between land use and the state of the natural environment than the simplistic cause-effect models that have been used in the past. ?? 2009 Queen's Printer and Controller of HMSO.

AB  - An empirical assessment of the interaction between the land use—transportation system and travel behavior is presented. A methodology for identifying a range of land use—transportation systems by a clustering technique with network and land use inputs was developed. Twenty neighborhoods from Orange County, California, were considered in this process. Three groups, or themes, were found to best represent the neighborhoods in the sample area: one each associated with the conventional definition of traditional and neotraditional neighborhood design (TND) and planned unit development (PUD) neighborhoods and one representing neighborhoods that blend characteristics of TND and PUD. Conventional measures of individual travel behavior were compared with an analysis of variance between the themes to identify significant differences, controlling for socioeconomic characteristics. Research results include the development of (a) a systematic methodology to identify a more explicit land use—transportation dimension, (b) an estimate of the potential effectiveness of design-oriented solutions to reduce automobile congestion by using the developed themes, and (c) a preliminary assessment of the extent to which development themes can be used to improve the current modeling framework.

Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided.

The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings from a range of disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems due to the nature of the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of this, this themed edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Drawing on recent work in environmental economics, this paper introduces the concept of the land use intensity of economic activity, analogous to the more familiar materials and energy intensities. It then considers how this might be measured, looking at a range of economic and land use change statistics, and how it might be reduced. Environmental compensation is seen as a possible means of achieving the latter objective. It is argued that no single measure of land use Intensity would be meaningful, because concern about [`]lost land' Is typically not about land in terms of hectares or economic value, but about the environmental significance of land use change. This in turn reflects a variety of material, post-material and non-instrumental values. The paper concludes that composite measures of the land use intensity of economic activity are likely to be the most useful; that environmental compensation may be a useful policy instrument within a carefully formulated framework; and that differences in values have to be confronted if sustainable land use change is ever to be defined.

AB  - The pattern of urban development strongly affects sustainability - energy and water use, food production, waste generation and disposal, biodiversity and equal opportunity. So regional planning must be a tool in achieving sustainability. The traditional urban pattern was a cluster of activities that people do together (city downtowns and neighborhood centers) surrounded by residences in a density gradient. That remains the most sustainable pattern. After World War II, the automobile promoted a pattern of scattered activities and spread out residences. Most other countries resisted the spread and scattered pattern, though without complete success; the US has only begun to recentralize. Three strategies are proposed to recentralize: Pricing goods and services to reflect sustainable needs, improving the magnetism of cities and legislating enforceable regional plans. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A zero - one integer-programming formulation of the simultaneous optimization of the problems of land-use assignment and transportation-network design is presented. The problem is modeled through a set-partitioning approach and incorporates a multiple-criteria objective function, appropriate upper- and lower-bound constraints on area assignments, and construction costs. A simple example and a more complicated urban-design case study are included to demonstrate the viability of this approach in solving the simultaneous-optimization problem. As a secondary benefit, this set-partitioning model can be reformulated as an integer, generalized-network, flow problem for which new efficient computer codes, capable of solving networks with thousands of nodes and variables, are available.

AB  - This paper presents a system dynamics approach to simultaneous land use/transportation system performance modeling. A model is designed based on the causality functions and feedback loop structure between a large number of physical, socioeconomic, and policy variables. The model system consists of 7 sub-models: population, migration of population, household, job growth-employment-land availability, housing development, travel demand, and traffic congestion level. The model is formulated in DYNAMO simulation language, and tested on a data set from Montgomery County, MD. In Part I: Methodology, the overall approach and the structure of the model system is discussed and the causal-loop diagrams and major equations are presented. In Part II: Application, the model is calibrated and tested with data from Montgomery County, MD. Least square method and overall system behavior are used to estimate the model parameters. The model is fitted with the 1970-80 data and validated with the 1980-1990 data. Robustness and sensitivities with respect to input parameters such as birth rate or regional economy growth are analyzed. The model performance as a policy analysis tool is also examined by predicting the year by year impacts of highway capacity expansion on land use and transportation system performance. While this is a first attempt in using dynamic system simulation modeling in simultaneous treatment of land use and transportation system interactions, and model development and application are limited to some extent due to data availability, the results clearly indicate that the proposed method is a promising approach in dealing with complex urban land use/transportation modeling.

AB  - Provision of recreational open space is a major factor in determining resident quality of life in cities. However, urban growth and land use change models typically omit park location and allocation issues when simulating changing urban environments. This paper introduces a method for exploring the spatial allocation of urban parks (public, recreational open spaces) given differing municipal and county investment decisions. Park planning literature has established level of service metrics as rough indicators of provision of public park amenities that are useful guides for future park investment decisions within a given jurisdiction. In this study, we create a dynamic-demand location model that simulates political feedback from population growth and LOS metrics to allocate new parklands (similar to 0.5 ha <= neighborhood parks <= similar to 4 ha) in multi-jurisdictional urbanizing regions. We frame parks as a new development type that augments residential development currently driving a version of the Regional Urban Growth (RUG) urban simulation model, an open source, raster-based simulation platform. Our approach allows planners and researchers to explore urban patterns and distributive outcomes associated with different local open space requirements and investment choices. We illustrate this approach under scenarios for the rapidly growing, three-county Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill region of North Carolina, USA. We test varying delays in park planning, purchase, and construction, varying maximum park sizes, and the effects of increased investment levels in two jurisdictions within our study area. This model suggests that the most important aspect of successful park planning is the length of the lag time between residential and park development. Perhaps the most successful park planning strategy is to plan parks along with residential areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Workflow-based applications are normally used in contexts where evolution is the norm. To address this, we are developing a model- based framework for building workflows, which takes inspiration on the ideas about separation of concerns. In this framework, we have identified co-evolution relationships and consistency problems related to evolution. In this short paper we briefly present our framework, and introduce a classification of co-evolution scenarios and consistency problems found within it. Finally, we discuss a strategy to take advantage of these rela- tionships, and reduce the number of subsequent consistency problems.

AB  - Co-evolution has an important function in the evolution of species and it is clearly manifested in certain scenarios such as host-parasite and predator-prey interactions, symbiosis and mutualism. The extrapolation of the concepts and methodologies developed for the study of species co-evolution at the molecular level has prompted the development of a variety of computational methods able to predict protein interactions through the characteristics of co-evolution. Particularly successful have been those methods that predict interactions at the genomic level based on the detection of pairs of protein families with similar evolutionary histories (similarity of phylogenetic trees: mirrortree). Future advances in this field will require a better understanding of the molecular basis of the co-evolution of protein families. Thus, it will be important to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the similarity observed in phylogenetic trees of interacting proteins, distinguishing direct specific molecular interactions from other general functional constraints. In particular, it will be important to separate the effects of physical interactions within protein complexes ('co-adaptation') from other forces that, in a less specific way, can also create general patterns of co-evolution.

AB  - This study examines the impact of uncertainty in the land use component of a partially integrated land use-transportation modeling system called UrbanSim. Outputs from the land use model (LUM) act as inputs for a traditional 4-step travel demand model (TDM), and travel times from the traffic-assignment stage of the TDM are fed forward into the subsequent years LUM. This work examines the propagation of uncertainty across model stages as well as at each model stage over time. A factorized design approach is used to model uncertainty in demographic inputs (which include aggregate growth rates and mobility rates) to the land use model, as well as uncertainty in various model parameters. The results suggest that while several model inputs may affect model outputs in the short run, only those inputs that have a cumulative effect are likely to have a significant impact on outputs in the long run. The results also suggest that uncertainty in model outputs may increase for the first few years for which the model is run, as modified inputs send shocks through the urban system. However, the level of uncertainty appears to come down in later years, as households, jobs, and developers respond to changed input conditions

AB  - In conservation areas, land use conﬂicts frequently occur due to the increasing number of land resource managers and users who usually have different interests, objectives and perceptions. Sharing all these apriori legitimate differences is a prerequisite for better collective management of the land. The companion modelling approach is used to build a shared representation of interactions between vegetation dynamics, reforestation efforts and livestock grazing in a forest conservation area of northern Thailand. This article focuses on the participatory modelling process that led to the co-construction of an agent-based model. Sensitizing exercises on vegetation dynamics and an agent-based simulator associated with a role-playing game were the main tools used. The social interactions and decision-making processes observed during the gaming and simulation sessions were used to construct a set of rules implemented in a subsequent autonomous agent-based model. It will be used to simulate future land management scenarios with local stakeholders.

AB  - Land-use change is one of the main drivers of many environmental change processes. It influences the basic resources of land use, including the soil. Its impact on soil often occurs so creepingly that land managers hardly contemplate initiating ameliorative or counterbalance measures. Poor land management has degraded vast amounts of land, reduced our ability to produce enough food, and is a major threat to rural livelihoods in many developing countries. To date, there has been no single unifying volume that addresses the multifaceted impacts of land use on soils. This book has responded to this challenge by bringing together renowned academics and policy experts to analyze the patterns, driving factors and proximate causes, and the socioeconomic impacts of soil degradation. Policy measures to prevent irreversible degradation and rehabilitate degraded soils are also identified.

AB  - Transportation and land use research of the past decade has focused in large part on the question of whether manipulating land uses in the direction of smart growth alternatives can reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or otherwise improve travel behavior. Yet the notion of manipulating land uses implies that the alternative is somehow self-organized or market-based. This view appears to underestimate the extent to which current planning interventions in the United States largely focused on lowering development densities, mandating ample road and parking designs, and separating land uses impose an auto-oriented template on most new development. Rather than a market failure, the paucity of smart growth alternatives may be a planning failure the result of municipal regulatory exclusion. This problem definition would shift the burden of proof for policy reform, as uncertainty in travel-behavior benefits would hardly justify the con- tinuation of exclusionary regulations. If municipal regulations in fact constrain alternatives to low- density, auto-oriented development, one would expect developers to perceive unsatisfied market interest in such development. This article studies, through a national survey (676 respondents), US developers perceptions of the market for pedestrian-and transit-oriented development forms. Overall, respondents perceive considerable market interest in alternative development forms, but believe that there is inadequate supply of such alternatives relative to market demand. Developer- respondents attribute this gap between supply and demand principally to local government regu- lation. When asked how the relaxation of these regulations would affect their product, majorities of developers indicated that such liberalization would lead them to develop in a denser and more mixed-use fashion, particularly in close-in suburban locales. Results are interpreted in favor land- policy reform based on the expansion of choice in transportation and land use. This view contrasts with a more prevalent approach which conditions policy interventions on scientific evidence of travel-behavior modification.

AB  - Computer simulation plays an increasingly important role in engineering education as a tool for enhancing classroom learning. This research investigates the efficacy of using simulation in teaching the topic of transportation network growth through an experiment conducted at the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota. In the experiment, a network growth simulator program (SONG) was incorporated into a senior/graduate class in transportation system analysis. Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - The decade since the initiation of the Land-Use/Cover Change (LUCC) project in 1995 (see Chap. 1) has witnessed considerable advances in the field of modeling of land-use/cover change. The science plan of the project indicated that the major task would be the development of a new generation of land-use/cover change models capable of simulating the major socioeconomic and biophysical driving forces of land-use and land-cover change. In addition, these models were supposed to be able to handle interactions at several spatial and temporal scales. Recent publications indicate that the LUCC science community has successfully met this challenge and a wide range of advanced models, aiming at different scales and research questions, is now available (Briassoulis 2000; Agarwal et al. 2001; Veldkamp and Lambin 2001; Parker et al. 2003; Nagendra et al. 2004; Veldkamp and Verburg 2004; Verburg et al. 2004b; Verburg and Veldkamp 2005). One of the most important observations that can be made examining the range of available land-use/ cover change models is the wide variety of approaches and concepts underlying the models. This chapter intends to describe the variety of modeling approaches, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches and indicate the remaining challenges for the land-use science community. Not being able to discuss all individual models and approaches, we will focus on broad distinctions between approaches and discuss how modelers have dealt with a number of important aspects of the functioning of the landuse system. A land-use system is understood here as a type of land use with interrelated determining factors with strong functional relations with each other (see Fig. 1.2). These factors include a wide range of land-use influencing factors than can be biophysical, economic, social, cultural, political, or institutional. The discussion of modeling approaches in this chapter is illustrated with examples of models and results from selected research projects.

AB  - In response to the concerns about the costs of sprawl and to guide growth development of Maryland's future, the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Economic Growth, Resource Protection, and Planning Act of 1992 and recently passed the Smart Growth and Neighborhood Conservation Act of 1997. While the first legislation established new visions for growth and development of Maryland's future, the second legislation gives the State programmatic and fiscal tools to assist local governments implementing the Visions. The growth management legislation has very important implications for land use development and transportation system in the Baltimore region. This research simulates the land use-transportation interactions by means of an integrated land use and transportation model, and evaluates economic and environmental impacts of smart growth and alternative policies and their distributional impacts by income groups in the Baltimore metropolitan region. The mode simulates the demand and supply in both land and transportation markets and models explicitly the feedback from the transportation system to the land use system and induced demand associated with transportation improvements. Consumers' surplus is used to evaluate the result and impacts of various policy scenarios on different income groups. This paper reports the mode design and database development for this modeling effort. Recently, the Baltimore Metropolitan Council (BMC) initiated the integrated land use/transportation modeling project. This paper summarizes the progress of this project. It first reviews the forces driving integrated modeling applications and the state of art in urban and regional modeling. Then, it outlines the model design for the Baltimore region. Finally it reports the database development for model calibration and forecasting.

The goal of the project is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of urban areas through compatible systems-level planning of land uses, urban form, and investments in public transportation facilities. The project also seeks to improve the communication of these concepts to elected officials and the public through the development of enhanced visualization techniques. The research is intended to answer questions about the interactions of land use policies and transit investments, posed in two forms. First, if alternative transit investment proposals are being evaluated for a community, what land use policies will be needed to optimize the effectiveness of those investments? Second, if specific changes in land use policy are being considered for a community, what types of transit investment will be most cost-effective for each land use policy scenario?. © ASCE.

Analysis of these data suggests that networks vary in their elasticity - where the internal network of the agency was rigid, but the extra-organizational network quite fluid. Further, the data suggest that, consistent with theories of socialization, individuals differ in plasticity - how they are affected by the network - where the cross-sectional analysis of the data suggest that individuals were molded by the organization, but that the attitudes of individuals who left were unaffected by the change in milieu.

Analogously, this hypothesis forms the foundation of a new co-evolution model in manufacturing between products design and manufacturing capabilities which is mathematically formulated and interpreted using parsimony analysis of cladograms. The model is validated using case studies involving assembly of automotive engine accessories.

No single measure best quantifies  effective coordination because this coordination supports potentially conflicting goals, such as better access management and\nincreased local autonomy.

AB  - Urban cities around the world are busy finding ways to manage traffic congestion that increasingly reduces the quality of life of the citizens and the productivity of the city. Many governments of developed countries had already learned that building your way out of congestion is totally cost ineffective and counterproductive, and is certainly not a recommended long-term strategy for congestion management. Instead, transportation professionals are calling the attention of the policymakers to focus on integration of land use and transportation as an effective mean to manage congestion. While coordinated land use planning can certainly help to enhance the movements of people and goods for the two primary modes of transportation, automobiles and public transport, the presentation will concentrate on the public transport sector instead of the highway sector. It will introduce the concept of Transit Oriented Development including background and principles, and the discussion will touch on of the following technical elements: Factors that favoring and hindering development around transit.

These include direct impacts on land used for transportation facilities, and indirect impacts caused by changes to land use development patterns. In particular, certain transportation planning decisions tend to increase sprawl (dispersed, urban-fringe, automobile-dependent development), while others support smart growth (more compact, infill, multi-modal development). These development patterns have various economic, social and environmental impacts. This paper describes specific methods for evaluating these impacts in transport planning.

AB  - Carmakers and suppliers currently experiment with new forms of relationships in order to prepare and develop coherent and valuable innovations that feature incrementally evolving new products (new services, architectural breakthroughs, etc.). We observe diversity both in the very nature of co-innovation partnerships and in the in-house organisational settings. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of these configurations for the partners? The aim of our research is to analyse the impact of the organisational forms of co-innovation on the performance of innovation processes. We first define co-innovation situations in contrast to the co-development model. We then present the innovation route analytical framework in order to empirically analyse co-innovation processes and assess their performance. Once this groundwork is laid, we compare four cases: two innovations both developed by a European (EASYCAR) and an Asian car manufacturer (NIPCAR). The comparison of the scenarios shows the variety of innovation cooperation processes and their related performance profiles. Keywords:

AB  - A supportive distribution of residential density is perceived to be an essential component of strategies aimed at increasing the use of public transit. To alter substantially land use-transport dynamics in a fashion that favours public transit patronage, residential density policies must be deployed over long periods and unfold at local and metropolitan levels simultaneously. The article narrates policies that attempted, since the late 1950s, a juxtaposition of high residential density and quality public transit services in the Toronto metropolitan region. Findings highlight the difficulties of pursuing such policies due to the power of neighbourhood-based interests, disagreement among jurisdictions within the metropolitan region and changes in priorities and intervention capacity. The article ends with proposals that seek to enhance the possibility of transforming the structure and dynamics of cities in ways that are compatible with smart growth principles.

AB  - Problem: Since the late 1980s, U.S. metropolitan regions have increasingly engaged in a style of land use-transportation scenario planning that merges techniques borrowed from military and business strategic planning with long-range transportation systems planning and project-level alternatives analysis. Aside from occasional anecdotal descriptions, the effectiveness of such approaches in generating compact growth plans has not been evaluated comprehensively. Purpose: We analyzed a wide range of scenario planning studies to determine how far compact growth scenarios are predicted to reduce vehicular travel below existing trends. Methods: Using hierarchical modeling, we developed a regional vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) model based on 85 scenarios in 23 planning studies from 18 metropolitan areas. Results and conclusions: Using coefficients from this model, we conservatively estimate that compact growth scenarios reduce VMT in 2050 by 17% below scenarios assuming a continuation of existing trends. Takeaway for practice: Existing transportation models remain largely insensitive to changes in land use and transportation policy. This must change for scenario planning to achieve its full potential. In the future, scenario planning should incorporate the best current knowledge about how global economic and environmental trends will affect regions.

AB  - In the past fifty years we have seen enormous growth in computing capability – computing is everywhere and has impacted nearly everything. In this talk, Dr. Douglas Engelbart, who pioneered much of what we now take for granted as interactive computing, examines the forces that have shaped this growth. He argues that our criteria for investment in innovation are, in fact, short-sighted and focused on the wrong things. He proposes, instead, investment in an improvement infrastructure that can result in sustained, radical innovation capable of changing computing and expanding the kinds of problems that we can address through computing. In this talk, Dr. Engelbart describes both the processes that we need to put in place and the capabilities that we must support in order to stimulate this higher rate of innovation. The talk closes with a call to action for this Co- Evolution Symposium audience, since this is a group that has both a stake in innovation and the ability to shape its direction.

AB  - Humankind is dependent upon Earth's ecological life support system,\nwhose well-being, in turn, depends upon the practices of human society.\nThe health of both systems requires harmonious, mutualistic interactions\nbetween them. Because of its population size and demographic\ndistribution (increasingly urbanized), humankind is also dependent upon\nits technological life support system, which, as currently managed,\nthreatens the ecological life support system. A fundamental difference\nexists between the two systems humankind is capable of using\nintelligence and reason to regulate its activities but the 30+ million\nother life forms that comprise the ecological life support system\ncannot. As a consequence, empathy for the other system is the\nresponsibility of human society. Sustainable co-evolution requires that\nhuman society has a high level of ecological literacy and acts in a\nnurturing, compassionate way toward the other system. Only then will\nsustainable co-evolution be possible since both systems are dynamic and\ncontinually changing.

AB  - In a previous paper [McCusker, B., Carr, E.R., 2006. The co-production of livelihoods and land use change: Case studies from South Africa and Ghana. Geoforum 37 (5), 790-804], we argued that land use and livelihoods could best be understood as co-produced, where land use and livelihoods are not separate objects of knowledge related to one another through abstract processes, but different manifestations of social processes through which individuals and groups come to understand the challenges facing their everyday lives, the various resources available to them to negotiate these challenges, and the strategies by which they can conduct that negotiation. In this paper, we examine the theoretical basis for "co-production" with the goal of using this approach to inform development interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review explores the role of land use and land use change as a determinant of the soil's ability to sequester and store carbon in the UK. Over 95 percent of the UK land carbon stock is located in soils which are subjected to a range of land uses and global changes. Land use change can result in rapid soil loss of carbon from peatlands, grasslands, plantation forest and native woodland. Soil carbon accumulates more slowly (decadal) but gains can be made when croplands are converted to grasslands, plantation forest or native woodland. The need for land for food production and renewable forms of energy could have considerable influence on UK soil carbon storage in the future. There is a need to recognise the risk of soil carbon losses occurring when land use change to increase carbon storage is offset by compensatory land use conversions elsewhere that result in net carbon release. The protection of peatland and other organic soil carbon stocks, and the management of cropland, grassland and forest soils to increase carbon sequestration, will be crucial to the maintenance of the UK carbon balance. It will be necessary to develop policy to balance trade-offs between soil carbon gains with other land use priorities. These include the sustainable production of food, bio-energy and fibre crops and livestock, water quality and hydrology, greenhouse gas emission control and waste management, all of which are underpinned by the soil.

AB  - A land use and transportation interaction model was developed for the Sacramento, California, region, using the MEPLAN framework. The model represents land markets directly together with location-choice processes of different industry and household categories and the interactions among them. These resulting economic interactions lead to trip matrixes that are assigned to a multimodal, capacity-restrained transportation network, generating travel times and disutilities that influence the location-choice process in the period from 1990 to 2015. A range of different policy options is simulated for that period. Five different scenarios are compared with a trend scenario, three representing different long- and short-term government transportation supply scenarios, one representing incentives and disincentives to encourage land use patterns complementary to an improved transit system, and one combining the land-incentive scenario with higher prices for private vehicle use. The scenario predictions differ in mode choice, firm location, residential location, development patterns, vehicle kilometers traveled, and land rents. Various land uses are seen to be bidding against each other, and the differences in spatial arrangements between scenarios are quite complex and demonstrate the richness of the model. Certain changes take time to develop, demonstrating the need for a long-term approach to planning.

AB  - This special issue consists of 10 papers that aim at deriving sustainability indicators based on the concept of socioeconomic metabolism. Its focus is on indicators that relate socioeconomic metabolism to land use. Six of the papers focus on methods to derive indicators. Of these, four examine approaches and applications of ecological footprints, one considers the 'material and energy flow accounting' toolbox that also includes human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP), and another one considers an approach for comparing the sustainability of landscapes based on remotely sensed GIS data. Two papers focus on conceptual and theoretical issues that are common to a number of tools: one discusses basic conceptual issues of observing progress towards sustainability, whereas the other compares basic conceptual considerations and research questions driving HANPP on the one hand, and the ecological footprint on the other. Three papers present case studies, two on Austria and one compares three countries (Austria, South Korea and the Philippines) to the global level. One paper uses broad empirical datasets to test hypotheses on the relations between HANPP and landscape structure.

AB  - NEV travel is rapidly increasing in the City of Lincoln. What was once considered a sleepy community has opened itself up to a tremendous opportunity for Smart Growth. This pilot NEV Transportation Plan will be an example to all cities in California. With, the expected population growth, aging citizens, and future residential development, the timing is ideal. Many positive impacts will make themselves present, such as the ability for residents to easily travel to local services, medical facilities, and commercial centers as the City's NEV-planned infrastructure development is fully implemented. Neighboring cities are working together to promote a network of safe routes for NEV travel. The NEV is a viable transportation alternative. The City plans to educate residents young and old about the benefits of driving NEVs. Families can use an NEV as a second vehicle for intracity travel and short trips, and high school/college students can use them to commute. The number of older Americans is expected to double over the next twenty-five years. Hopefully in the near future, the "restricted" driver's license program for the elderly will be codified and supported by all DMV offices. Within the text of AB 2353, Chapter 7 Neighborhood Electric Vehicle Transportation Plan, it states:"It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this chapter, to encourage discussions between the Legislature, the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the California Highway Patrol regarding the adoption of a new classification for licensing motorists who use neighborhood electric vehicles." In accordance with the intent stated in AB 2353, it is recommended that the State of California expand the current restricted license program and establish an. NEV driver's license program. In addition, it is recommended that an incentive program be established to encourage drivers with physical challenges to exchange their automobile driver's license for an NEV driver's license. This program should be aimed at those who no longer feel comfortable driving in high-speed traffic. One retired highway patrolmen suggested a one to two-year automatic extension incentive when exchanging licenses. The need for mobility in an aging population makes this suggestion worth pursuing. The Cities of Lincoln and Rocklin are working toward nationwide uniformity of NEV Transportation Plan design elements. The trend of transportation using electric vehicles is catching on quickly. It is a tremendously desirable mode of transportation because it is good for the environment, economical, safe and fun. Transportation planning by local governments, in cooperation with the citizens in many communities, is proliferating throughout the nation. In the future, the standardization of signs, pavement markings, vehicle codes and design standards will assist with an efficient transition and modernization of roadways and infrastructure to allow for safe NEV travel.

AB  - Urban sustainable mobility solutions are being discussed throughout the world to deal with problems of high use of land, congestion situations, energy consumption and emissions derived from road transportation. Part of these solutions concerns the promotion of public transportation as an alternative to individual transportation. Public transport only becomes an attractive option if, for the mobility provided (passenger x km), emits less pollutants and consume less energy. This paper focuses on comparing the fuel consumption and tailpipe emissions (CO2, HC, CO, NOx, PM) between urban Diesel buses (10 litres and 2.7 litres turbocharged Diesel) and typical gasoline and diesel European light duty vehicles (1.2 litres gasoline, 1.9 litres turbocharged Diesel). Results are analyzed as a function of transported passengers. For the proposed analysis, typical low traffic and congested traffic driving cycles were selected as an input to the EcoGest model, combined with driver behaviour characteristics and vehicle characteristics. Main results are easy-to-use charts highlighting where each mode is more attractive as a function of the number of passengers inside the bus and the number of people inside the vehicle. Results were obtained using EcoGest, a numerical model developed in our research institute. This model allows simulating the energetical and environmental performance of a road vehicle in a predefined route, accounting for the driving behaviour, vehicle specifications, powertrain specifications, occupation rate and road grade. The model has been used to simulate light duty and heavy duty vehicles, including gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen cars, and diesel and natural gas buses. Predicted results have been compared with measured fuel consumption and tail-pipe emissions in real-traffic situations, standard cycles (FTP75, NEDC), and predicted results of similar models (e.g. ADVISOR). Predictions of EcoGest are, usually, very good. Copyright ASCE 2008.

AB  - The paper starts by distinguishing between two types of software evolution studies. The first addresses evolution as a noun and focuses on it as a phenomenon. The second addresses the topic as a verb and focuses on methods and tools intended to facilitate software evolution and the tasks that implement it. Both views are necessary to achieve increased insight and a degree of mastery of the evolution phenomenon and to develop improved tools and technology.  Keywords: co-evolution, noun and verb, management, software evolution, software process, tools  1 INTRODUCTION  The universal experience that software that is used undergoes continuing evolution was first discussed in the early seventies [leh74]. More recently the theme of evolution has roused widespread interest as demonstrated by various workshops, conferences and research investigations. In the context of this activity it is apparent that those involved divide into two groups. The first and larger group is concerned with the quest...

AB  - Future changes in land Use in the coastal zone will be dominated by the effects of climate change. The major effect of climate change on the coastal zone will be clue to increasing sea level which, in combination with possible increases in the frequency and intensity of storms, will bring about: change in patterns of erosion and sedimentation increased risk of flooding change in the distribution and types of coastal habitats. The coastline has always been subject to change through erosion and other natural Processes. Climate change may speed this change. This will mean profound impacts on low-lying coastal areas over the next 50 years, particularly along the eastern coast of England. These physical changes in the coastal zone will occur alongside, and interact with. a variety of human impacts and drivers of change. Agricultural policy reform, and changes in production in response to this and to climate change, will alter coastal landscapes as well as sediment and nutrient inputs into coastal waters. Demographic change - an increasing UK population, who are on average older and who potentially have more leisure time - will be likely to bring about an increased demand for the recreational opportunities that the coast provides. This will mean more demand for land for housing and recreational facilities. A continuing trend of rising income levels may also fuel further demand for imported goods and hence the need for further port development, particularly in the south east of England. Coastal landscapes are also likely to be heavily impacted by the construction of renewable energy infrastructure, i.e. offshore wind farms and wave and tidal power projects.

AB  -  Summary form only given. This research focuses on the problem of the semantic linking and co-evolution of the different design diagrams and models of an object-oriented software application. The blueprint of an object-oriented software application consists mainly of models drawn in a modeling language. The state-of-the-art modeling language in object-oriented software development is the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Our research hypothesis is that using decidable fragments of first order logic to express the different UML diagrams enables the semantic linking of the different diagrams and models and enables the support of co-evolution which can be semi-automated, enhancing the reusability, maintainability and understandability of the design of the software application and of the software application in general. We propose to develop a formal framework to support the linking of the different diagrams and models within the software development life cycle (SDLC). The advantages of such a framework are: reasoning capabilities are provided, co-evolution is more guaranteed, adaptability of the design is improved and reuse and understandability of the software design increases. To support co-evolution of the design models in a semi-automatic way we investigate the query capabilities of these logic families.
