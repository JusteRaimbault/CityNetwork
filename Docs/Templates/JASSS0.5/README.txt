A CLASS AND TEMPLATE FOR JASSS ARTICLES v.0.5, 2016-03-24
Author: Giangiacomo Bravo <giangiacomo.bravo@lnu.se> 

The bundle is composed by five files. The 'JASSS.cls', jasss.bst, 'JASSS.png' and 'bar.png' files are needed to build the output. They should be included in your localtexmf directory (remeber to refresh the file-name database) or simply copied in the one where you keep your LaTeX code.

In addition, a template is provided in the 'TemplateJASSS.tex' file. Please always use this template for your submissions.
 
In order to correctly build the output, the following packages should be installed in your system: graphicx, xcolor, booktabs, amsmath, ifthen, geometry, authblk, natbib, endnotes.

Please always use pdfLaTeX and BibTeX (not BibLaTeX).

The font used is Source Sans Pro, normally included in Tex Live and other  major LaTeX distributions. In case of problems, the font location at CTAN is http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/sourcesanspro/

Remember to include the bibliographic database (the bib file) when submitting.
