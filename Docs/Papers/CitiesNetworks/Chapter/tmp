Introduction
1.1
Structuring effects of transportation networks
The confusion on possible simple causal relationships has fed a scientific debate that is still active nowa-
days. The underlying question relies on more or less deterministic attributions of impacts to trans-
portation infrastructures or to a new transportation mode on territorial transformations. Precursors of
such a reasoning can be tracked back in the twenties: McKenzie, from the Chicago school, mentions
in [Burgess et al., 1925] some “modifications of forms of transportation and communication as determin-
ing factors of growth and decline cycles [of territories]” (p. 69). Methodologies to identify what is then
called structuring effects of transportation networks has been developed for planning in the seventies:
[Bonnafous and Plassard, 1974] situates the concept of structuring effect in the perspective of using the
transportation offer as a planning tool (the alternatives are the development of an offer to answer to a
congestion of the network, and the simultaneous development of associated offer and planning). These
authors identify from an empirical viewpoint direct effects of a novel offer on the behavior of agents,
on transportation flows and possible inflexions on socio-economic trajectories of concerned territories.
[Bonnafous et al., 1974] develop a method to identify such effects through the modification of the class of
cities in a typology established a posteriori. More recently, [Bonnafous, 2014] recalls that the institution of
permanent observatories for territories makes such analyses more robust, allowing a continuous monitoring
of the territories that are the most concerned by the extent of a new infrastructure.
According to [Offner, 1993] which follows ideas already given by [Plassard, 1977] for example, a not rea-
soned and out-of-context use of these methods has then been developed by planners and politicians which
generally used them to justify transportation projects in a technocratic manner: through the argument of
a direct effect of a new infrastructure on local development (for example economic), politics are able to ask
for subsidies and to legitimate their action in front of the people. [Offner, 1993] insists on the necessity of
a critical positioning on these issues, recalling that there exists no scientific demonstration of an effect that
would be systematic. A special issue of the journal L’Espace Géographique [Offner et al., 2014] on that
debate recalled that on the one hand misconceptions and misuses were still greatly present in operational
and planning communities, which can be explained for example by the need to justify public actions, and
on the other hand that a scientific understanding of relations between networks and territories is still in
construction. A. Bonnafous (interview on the 09/01/2018, see Appendix ??) gives the current example
of the project of the Seine-Nord-Europe canal 1 as a transportation project for which traffic previsions were
largely overestimated and that politics of concerned territories have largely instrumentalized.

11.2
Co-evolution of cities and networks
The evolutive urban theory considers systems of cities as systems of systems at multiple scale, from the
intra-urban microscopic level, to the macroscopic level of the whole system, through the mesoscopic level of
the city [Pumain, 2008]. These systems are complex, dynamical, and adaptive: their components co-evolve
and the system answers to internal or external perturbations by modifying its structure and its dynamics.
We will largely develop the multiple implications of this approach all along our work, and retain here
processes of interactions between cities. These interactions consist in material or informational exchanges,
and the diffusion of innovation is therein a crucial component [Pumain, 2010]. These are necessarily carried
by physical networks, and more particularly transportation networks. We expect thus from a theoretical
point of view strong interdependencies between cities and transportation networks at these scales, i.e. a
co-evolution.
From the empirical point of view, it has already been shown: [Bretagnolle, 2009] reveals an increasing
correlation in time between urban hierarchy and the hierarchy of temporal accessibility for the French
railway network (which is a priori clearer for this measure than for integrated measures of accessibility
that are prone to auto-correlation as we will see in ??). This correlation is a witness of positive feedbacks
between urban ranks and network centralities. Different regimes in space and times has been identified: for
the evolution of the French railway network, a first phase of adaptation of the network to the existing urban
configuration was followed by a phase of co-evolution, in the sense that causal relations became difficult
to identify. The impact of the contraction of space-time by networks on patterns of growth potential had
already been shown for Europe with an exploratory analysis in [Bretagnolle et al., 1998].
Modeling results by [Bretagnolle and Pumain, 2010], and more particularly the different parametriza-
tions of the Simpop2 model 2 , show that the evolution of the railway network in the United States has
followed a rather different dynamic, without hierarchical diffusion, shaping locally urban growth in some
cases. This particular context of conquest of a space empty of infrastructures implies a specific regime
for the territorial system. Other contexts reveal different impacts of the network at short and long term:
[Berger and Enflo, 2017] study the impact of the construction of the Swedish railway network on the
growth of urban populations, from 1800 to 2010, and find an immediate causal effect of the accessibility
increase on population growth, followed on long times of a strong inertia for population hierarchy. In each
case, we indeed observe the existence of structural dynamics on long times, which correspond to the slow
dynamics of the urban system structure, and witness in that sense of structuring effects on long times
as [Pumain, 2014] puts it.
We must be careful to differentiate the latest from the structuring effects previously mentioned which
are subject to debates. At the level of the urban system, it is relevant to globally follow trajectories that
were possible, and locally the effect has necessarily a probabilistic aspect. Moreover, we insist on the role of
path-dependency for trajectories of urban systems: for example the existence in France of a previous system
of cities and network (postal roads) has strongly influenced the development of the railway network, or as
[Berger and Enflo, 2017] showed for Sweden. The same way, [Chaudhuri, G. and Clarke, Keith C., 2015]
highlight the importance of historical events in coupled dynamics of the road network and territories,
historical shocks that can be seen as exogenous and inducing bifurcations of the system that accentuate
the effect of path-dependency. Therefore, for these structural dynamics on long times, forecasting can
difficultly be considered.
1.3
Models of co-evolution
We can now switch to models that integrate dynamically the paradigm Territory ↔ Network, which as we
recall assumes that the conditioning of one by the other can not be identified. The ontologies used, as we
2
The generic structure of the Simpop2 model is the following [Pumain, 2008]: cities are characterized by their pop-
ulation ad their wealth; they product goods according to their economic profile; interactions between cities produce ex-
changes, determined by the offer and demand functions; populations evolve according to wealth after exchanges.
2will see, often couple 3 network elements with territorial components, but this positioning is not necessary
and some elements may be hybrid (for example a governance structure for the transportation network
may simultaneously belong to both aspects). In our reading of models, these different specifications will
naturally arise.
We will broadly designate by model of co-evolution simulation models that include a coupling of urban
growth dynamics and transportation network growth dynamics. These are relatively rare, and for most
of them still at the stage of stylized models. The efforts being relatively sparse and in very different
domains, there is not much unity in these approaches, beside the abstraction of the assumption of an
interdependency between networks and territorial characteristics in time. We propose to review them still
through the prism of scales.
1.3.1
Microscopic and mesoscopic scales
Geometrical Models [Achibet et al., 2014] describes a co-evolution model at a very large scale (scale
of the building), in which evolution of both network and buildings are ruled by a same agent, influenced
differently by network topology and population density, and that can be understood as an agent of urban
development. The model allows to simulate an auto-organized urban extension and to produce district con-
figurations. Even if it strongly couples territorial components (buildings) and the road network, described
results do not imply any conclusion on the processes of co-evolution themselves.
A generalization of the geometrical local optimization model described before is developed in [Barthelemy and Flamm
It aims at capturing the co-evolution of network topology with the density of its nodes. The localization
of new nodes is simultaneously influenced by density and centrality, yielding the looping of the strong
coupling. More precisely, the global behavior of the model is the same, as the network extension behav-
ior. Centers then localize following a utility function that is a linear combination of average betweenness
centrality in a neighborhood and of the opposite of density (dispersion due to higher price as a function
of density). This utility is used to compute the probability of localization of new centers following a
discrete choices model. The model allows to show that the influence of centrality reinforces aggregation
phenomena (in particular through an analytical resolution on a one-dimensional version of the model),
and furthermore reproduces exponentially decreasing density profiles (Clarcke’s law) which are observed
empirically.
[Ding et al., 2017] introduce a model of co-evolution between different layers of the transportation
network, and show the existence of an optimal coupling parameter in terms of inequalities for the centrality
in network conception: if the road network is assimilated at a fine granularity to a population distribution,
this model can be compared with the precedent model of co-evolution between the transportation network
and the territory.
Economic models [Levinson et al., 2007] take an economic approach, which is richer from the point of
view of network development processes implied, similar to a four step model (i.e. including the generation
of origin-destination flows and the assignment of traffic in the network) including travel cost and congestion,
coupled with a road investment module simulating toll revenues for constructing agents, and a land-use
evolution module updating actives and employments through discrete choice modeling. The exploration
experiments show that co-evolving network and land uses lead to positive feedbacks reinforcing hierarchies.
These are however far from satisfying, since network topology does not evolve as only capacities and flows
change within the network, what implies that more complex mechanisms (such as the planning of new
infrastructures) on longer time scales are not taken into account. [Li et al., 2016] have recently extended
this model by adding endogenous real estate prices and an optimization heuristic with a genetic algorithm
for deciding agents.
3
We recall the definition of model coupling, which corresponds to the one of system or process coupling given in intro-
duction: it is the construction of a model that is simultaneously the extension of each initial model.
3From an other point of view, [Levinson and Chen, 2005] is also presented as a model of co-evolution,
but corresponds more to a predictive model based on Markov chains, and thus closer to a statistical
analysis than a simulation model based on these processes. [Rui and Ban, 2011] describe a model in
which the coupling between land-use and network topology is done with a weak paradigm, land-use and
accessibility having no feedback on network topology, the land-use model being conditioned to the growth
of the autonomous network.
Cellular automatons A simple hybrid model explored and applied to a stylized planning example of
the functionnal distribution of a new district in [?], relies on mechanisms of accessibility to urban activities
for the growth of settlements with a network adapting to the urban shape. The rules for network growth
are too simple to capture more elaborated processes than just a simple systematic connection (such as
potential breakdown for example), but the model produces at a large scale a broad range of urban shapes
reproducing typical patterns of human settlements. This model is inspired by [Moreno et al., 2012] for its
core mechanisms but yield a much broader generation of forms by taking into account urban functions.
At these relatively large scales, spanning from the urban to the metropolitan scale, mechanisms of
population localization influenced by accessibility coupled to mechanisms of network growth optimizing
some particular functions seem to be the rule for this kind of models: in the same way, [Wu et al., 2017]
couple a cellular automaton for population diffusion to a network optimizing local cost that depends on
the geometry and on population distribution.
Models answering to more remote questions can furthermore be linked to our problem: for example,
in a conceptual way, a certain form of strong coupling is also used in [Bigotte et al., 2010] which by
an approach of operational research propose a network design algorithm to optimize the accessibility to
amenities, taking into account both network hierarchy and the hierarchy of connected centers.
This way, co-evolution models at the microscopic and mesoscopic scales globally have the following
structure: (i) processes of localization or relocalization of activities (actives, buildings) influenced by
their own distribution and network characteristics; (ii) network evolution, that can be topological or not,
answering to very diverse rules: local optimization, fixed rules, planning by deciding agents. This diversity
suggests the necessity to take into account the superposition of multiple processes ruling network evolution.
1.3.2
Urban systems modeling
At a macroscopic scale, co-evolution can be taken into account in models of urban systems. [Baptiste, 1999]
propose to couple an urban growth model based on migrations (introduced by the application of synergetics
to systems of cities by [Sanders, 1992]) with a mechanism of self-reinforcement of capacities for the road
network without topological modification. More precisely, the general principles of the model are the
following.
• Attractivity and repulsion indicators allow for each city to determine emigration and immigration
rates and to make populations evolve.
• Network topology is fixed in time, but capacities of links evolve. The rule is an increase in capacity
when the flow becomes greater given a fixed parameter threshold during a given number of iterations.
Flows are affected with a gravity model of interaction between cities.
The last version of this model is presented by [Baptiste, 2010]. General conclusions that can be
obtained from this work are that this coupling yield a hierarchical configuration 4 and that the addition of
the network produces a less hierarchical space, allowing medium-sized cities to benefit from the feedback
of the transportation network.
4
But we also know that simpler models, only a preferential for example, allow to reproduce this stylized fact. The
model must have as an objective to answer to broader questions, such as the fine understanding of co-evolution processes,
what is not done here. However, one of its operational objectives is otherwise fulfilled, through the application to France
and the study of the impact of a high speed line project, recalling the multiple possible functions of a model (see ??).
4The model proposed by [Blumenfeld-Lieberthal and Portugali, 2010] can be seen as a bridge between
the mesoscopic scale and the approaches of urban systems, since it simulates migrations between cities and
network growth induced by potential breakdown when detours are too large. In the continuity of Simpop
models for systems of cities, [Schmitt, 2014] describes the SimpopNet model which aims at precisely
integrating co-evolution processes in systems of cities on long time scales, typically via rules for hierarchical
network development as a function of the dynamics of cities, coupled with these that depends on network
topology. Unfortunately the model was not explored nor further studied, and furthermore stayed at a
toy-level. [Cottineau, 2014] proposes an endogenous transportation network growth as the last building
brick of the Marius modeling framework, but it stays at a conceptual level since this brick has not been
specified nor implemented yet. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no model which is empirical or
applied to a concrete case based on an approach of co-evolution by urban systems from the point of view
of the evolutive urban theory.
We can see well the opposition to epistemological principles of economic geography: [Fujita et al., 1999]
introduce for example an evolutionary model able to reproduce and urban hierarchy and an organization
typical of central place theory [Banos et al., 2011], but that still relies on the notion of successive equi-
libriums, and moreover considers a “Krugman-like” model, i.e. a one dimensional and isotropic space, in
which agents are homogeneously distributed 5 . This approach can be instructive on economic processes in
themselves but more difficultly on geographical processes, since these imply the embedding of economic
processes in the geographical space which spatial particularities not taken into account in this approach
are crucial. Our work will focus on demonstrating to what extent this structure of space can be important
and also explicative, since networks, and even more physical networks induce spatio-temporal processes
that are path-dependent and thus sensitive to local singularities and prone to bifurcations induced by the
combination of these with processes at other scales (for example the centrality inducing a flow).
At the macroscopic scale, existing models are based on the evolution of agents (generally cities) as a
consequence of their interactions, carried by the network, whereas the evolution of the network can follow
different rules: self-reinforcement, potential breakdown. The general structure is globally the same than
at larger scales, but ontologies stay fundamentally different.

Specification of co-evolution models
This section extends the logic of integrating a system of cities with a transportation network, which has
been pursued in a static way for network behavior in the interaction model developed and explored in
section ??, to propose a macroscopic model of co-evolution for systems of cities.
2.1
Rationale
This first approach relies in a direct extension of the interaction model within a system of cities described in
chapter ??, at a macroscopic scale with an ontology typical to systems of cities. For the sake of simplicity,
we still stick to an unidimensional description of cities by their population.
Concerning network growth, we propose also to stay at a relatively aggregated and simplified level,
allowing to test growth heuristics at different levels of abstraction. In order to be flexible on model mecha-
nisms, diverse processes can be taken into account, such as direct interactions between cities, intermediate
interactions through the network, the feedback of network flows and a demand-induced network growth.
Empirical characteristics emphasized by [Thévenin et al., 2013] for the French railway network suggest
the existence of feedbacks of network use, or of flows traversing it, on its persistence and its development,
whose properties have evolved in time: a first phase of strong development would correspond to an answer
5
The absence of a real space is not an issue in this economic approach that aims at understanding processes out of
their context. In our case, the structure of the geographical space is not separable, and indeed at the core of the issues we
are interested in.

to a high need of coverage, followed by a reinforcement of main link and the disappearance of weakest
links.
The coupling between cities and the network will be achieved by the intermediate of flows between
cities in the network: these capture the interactions between cities and have simultaneously an influence
on the network in which they flow.
2.2
Model description
The urban system is characterized by populations μ i (t) and the network G(t), to which can be associated
a distance matrix d G
ij (t). Flows between cities φ ij follow the expression given in ?? with network distance.
The same way, the evolution of populations follows the specifications of the base model. The Fig. 1 shows
the structure of the model.
Concerning the network, we assume that it evolves following the equation
G(t + 1) = F (G(t), φ ij (t))
(1)
such that the assignment of flows within the network and a local variation of its elements is possible. We
propose in a first time to consider patterns linked to distance only, and to specify a relation on an abstract
network as
G
d G
(2)
ij (t + 1) = F (d ij (t), φ ij (t))
i.e. an evolution of the distance matrix only. In this spirit, we keep an interaction model strictly at a
macroscopic scale, since a precise spatialization of the network would imply to take into account a finer
scale that includes the local shape of the network which determines shortest paths.
6Following a thresholded feedback heuristic, given a flow φ in a link, we assume its effective distance to
be updated by:
  γ s  


1 − φ φ 0
  γ s  
d(t + 1) = d(t) ·  1 + g max · 
(3)
1 + φ φ 0
with γ s a hierarchy parameter, φ 0 the threshold parameter and g max the maximal growth rate at each
step. This auto-reinforcement function can be interpreted the following way: above a limit flow φ 0 , the
travel
  conditions improve, whereas they deteriorate below. The hierarchy of gain is given by γ s , and since
γs

→ φ→∞ −1, g max is the maximal distance gain. This function is similar to the one used by
[Tero et al., 2007] 6 .

3.1
Implementation
The coupling of the interaction model to a finer representation of the network (for example an encoding
of the whole network structure) makes the full integration into an OpenMole plugin more difficult, as it
was done for the model studied in ??. We need here an ad hoc implementation. The use of a workflow as
a mediator for coupling is an interesting solution but which is realistic only for a weak coupling as in ??.
One of the issues that the meta-modeling library for OpenMole that is currently being developed around
OpenMole will have to tackle is the possibility to allow strong coupling (for example in the sense of a
dynamical coupling during the evolution of the simulation) of heterogeneous components in a transparent
way, in order to benefit from the advantages of different languages or of already existing implementations.
We choose here a full implementation with NetLogo, for the simplicity of coupling between components.
A particular care is taken for the duality of network representation, both as a distance matrix and as a
physical network, in order to facilitate the extension to physical network heuristics.
3.2
Exploration on a synthetic system of cities
The model is first tested and explored on synthetic city systems, in order to understand some of its
intrinsic properties. In this case, we consider the model with an abstract network as specified above,
i.e. without spatial description of the network and with evolution rules acting directly on d G
ij given the
previous specifications.
A synthetic city system is generated following the heuristic used in the previous section: (i) N S cities
are randomly distributed in the euclidian plan; (ii) populations are attributed to cities following an inverse
power law, with a hierarchy parameter α S and such that the largest city has a population equal to P max ,
i.e. following P i = P max · i −α S .
To simplify, several meta-parameters are fixed: the number of cities is fixed at N S = 30, the maximal
population at P max = 100000 and the maximal network growth to g max = 0.005. Final time is fixed at
t f = 30, what corresponds to distances divided approximatively by 5 7 , in order to comply to an empirical
constraint: this corresponds to the evolution of the travel time between Paris and Lyon from around ten

Indeed, we can compute that the minimal multiplicative factor for distance is (1 − g max ) t f , what gives for these values
(1 − 0.05) 30 ' 0.214, i.e. a division by 5 of the travel time.
7hours at the beginning of the century to two hours today, showed for example by [Thévenin et al., 2013].
We also neglect network effects at the second order by taking w N = 0.
We explore a grid in the parameter space α S , φ 0 , γ s , w G , d G , γ G . We use the indicators introduced
in ?? to quantify model behavior in the parameter space. We describe the results for α S = 1, what is the
closest to existing city systems (in comparison to 0.5 and 1.5, see the systematic review of the rank-size
law estimations done by [Cottineau, 2017]).
L’évolution de la centralité de proximité moyenne dans le temps est visualisée en Fig. ?? (haut) pour
w G = 0.001, et à (γ G , φ 0 ) variables. Le comportement n’est pas sensible à d G (voir graphique complet
en ??). Cette évolution témoigne d’une transition en fonction du niveau de hiérarchie : lorsque celui-
ci décroit, on observe l’émergence de trajectoires où la centralité moyenne croît dans le temps, ce qui
correspond à des situations où l’ensemble des villes bénéficie en moyenne d’accroissements d’accessibilité.
Concerning the entropy of populations, for which the temporal trajectory is shown in Fig. ?? (bottom),
all parameters give a decreasing entropy, i.e. a behavior of convergence of cities trajectories in time 8 .
Looking at the complexity of accessibility trajectories, we observe for values of φ 0 > 1.5 a maximum
of complexity as a function of interaction distance d G , stable when w G and γ G vary (see also the exhaus-
tive plots in Fig. ??, Appendix ??). This intermediate scale can be interpreted as producing regional
subsystems, large enough for each to develop a certain level of complexity, et isolated enough to avoid
the convergence of trajectories over the whole system. We reconstruct therein a spatial non-stationarity,
typically observed in ??, and rejoin the concept of the ecological niche 9 localized in space: the emergent
subsystems that are relatively independent, are good candidates to contain processes of co-evolution. The
emergence of this intermediate scale can be compared to the modularity of the French urban system
showed by [Berroir et al., 2017].
Finally, the behavior of rank correlations for accessibility reveals that the interaction distance system-
atically increases the number of hierarchy inversions, what corresponds in a sense to an increase in overall
system complexity. The hierarchy parameter diminishes this correlation, what means that a more hier-
archical organization will impact a larger number of cities in the qualitative aspects of their trajectories.
This effect is similar to the “first mover advantage” showed by [Levinson and Xie, 2011], which unveils a
path dependency and an advantage to be rapidly connected to the network: in our case, the modifications
in the hierarchy correspond to cities that benefit from their positioning in the network.
3.3
Application to the French system of cities
The model is then applied to the French system of cities on long time dynamical data: the Pumain-INED
database for populations, spanning from 1831 to 1999 [?], with the evolving railway network from 1840 to
2000 [Thévenin et al., 2013]. Such a time span can be associated with structural effect on long time, as
developed in ??. This application aims on the one hand at testing the ability of the model to reproduce
a real dynamic of co-evolution, and on the other hand at extracting thematic information on processes
through calibrated parameter values.
3.3.1
Data
We work on railway network data constructed by [Thévenin et al., 2013]. The French railway network
is particularly interesting jointly with population data already presented, since the covered time span is
relatively close, and as [Thévenin et al., 2013] recalls, this transportation mode has at any times materi-
alized the implication of public and private actors. It corresponds to different processes depending on the
period, from a more decentralized management to a more centralized recently, and different technological
materializations with for example the recent emergence of high speed trains [Zembri, 1997]. For each date
8
Indeed, the entropy for the population variable gives the dispersion of the distribution of populations, and thus its
decrease translate a trend to concentrate in time.
9
As it was already described in ??, an ecological niche in the sense of [Holland, 2012] corresponds to the relatively
independent ecosystem in which there is co-evolution between the species.
8in the population database, we extract the simplified abstract network in which all stations and inter-
sections with a degree larger than two are linked with abstract links which speed and length attributes
correspond to real values, at a granularity of 1km 10 . This yields the time-distance matrices between the
cities included in the model.
3.3.2
Stylized facts
Before calibrating the model, we can observe the lagged correlation patterns in the dataset, by applying
the causality regimes method. This empirical study should on the one hand allow us to verify well known
stylized facts, and on the other hand to produce a preliminary knowledge of empirical system
behavior.
P
We compute as detailed above the closeness centrality through the network, given by T i = j exp −d ij /d 0 ,
and we study the lagged correlation between its derivative ∆T i and the derivative of the population ∆P i ,
given by ρ̂ τ = ρ̂ [∆P i (t), ∆T i (t − τ )] estimated on a moving window containing T w successive dates. We
show in Fig. 2 the results obtained.
These results are important for at least two reasons. First, the behavior of the number of significant
correlations as a function of T w and d 0 allows us to find stationarity scales in the system. We observe
on the one hand a specific spatial scale that gives a maximum for all temporal windows, at d 0 = 100km,
what suggests the existence of consistent regional subsystems, which existence is stable in time: indeed,
this value corresponds to the interaction distance. It remarkably coincides with the intermediate scale
isolated in the synthetic model. On the other hand, long spatial ranges induce an optimal temporal scale,
for T w = 4 what corresponds to around twenty years: we identify it as the overall temporal stationarity
scale of the system and study the lagged correlations for this value.
Secondly, the behavior of lagged correlations does not seem to comply to the existing literature. At
the intermediate spatial scale, the values of ρ + , ρ − exhibit no regularity. On the whole system, there is
until 1946 close to no significant effect, then no causality between 1946 and 1975 (maximum at τ = 0,
non-significant minimum), and a 5 years shift of accessibility causing population after 1968 (the effect
staying however doubtful). We do not reproduce the correlation effect between network centrality and
place in the urban hierarchy advocated by [Bretagnolle, 2003] 11 , what lead us to question the existence
of the “structural co-evolution” on long time described by Bretagnolle in [Offner et al., 2014]. What
[Bretagnolle, 2003] obtains is a simultaneous correspondence between growth rate and level of connectivity
to the network (and not with network dynamic), but not in our sense a co-evolution, since no statistical
relation is furthermore exhibited.
We rejoin the recent results of [Mimeur et al., 2017] that show the statistical non-significance of the
correlation between growth rate and evolution of network coverage and accessibility, at a zero delay. Our
results are less precise on the class of cities studied (they differentiate large and small cities, and work
on a larger panel), but more general as they study variable delays and accessibility ranges, and are thus
complementary.
3.3.3
Calibration of the abstract model
Expected results of the calibration on real data concern both the more or less accurate reproduction of real
city population growth dynamics, i.e. to what extent the inclusion of a dynamical network can increase
the explanatory power for trajectories, and also how realistic the evolution of network distance is. We still
work with the abstract model.
10
This processing is achieved thanks to the R package for transportation network analysis specifically developed for this
thesis, see ??.
11
As [Lemoy and Caruso, 2017] is not able to reproduce, for density profiles as a function of the distance to the cen-
ter of European metropolis, the transition that allows [Guérois and Pumain, 2008] to define the peri-urban. These more
or less recent works are not reproducible, producing neither code nor data, and giving only a superficial description of the
methods, and it is thus impossible to know the origin of the qualitative divergence obtained. A good reproducibility to-
gether with the construction of systematic comparisons (benchmarks) of models, empirical analysis, that are recent but
also to validate old studies, seems to be a reasonable solution to this kind of issue.

10Model evaluation We can add to the indicators used before a calibration indicator for distance. The
particular property of adjustment for populations, that resides in the existence of a power law for the sizes
of cities that made negligible the performance on medium and small cities in the case of a cumulated error,
and suggested the addition of the indicator on the error on logarithms, is not present for distances that
follow a distribution concentrated on a single order of magnitude. We use therefore a standard measure
of fit, given by



X X 
ε D = log 
d ij (t) − d  ̃ ij (t) 
t
i,j
where d ij (t) are observed distances and d  ̃ ij (t) the simulated distances. It is simply a cumulated squared-
error, as used for the comparison of origin-destination matrices in a similar case of simulation of a trans-
portation network in [Jacobs-Crisioni and Koopmans, 2016].
Results We proceed to a non-stationary calibration, on the (ε P , ε D ) objectives, i.e. the squared-error on
populations and on distances. The estimation is done with a moving window with the periods already used
in ??. In order to have a limited dimension to explore, we take a fixed w N = 0 to study the interactions
only at the first order, knowing that the abstract network parameters (g max , γ S , φ 0 ) are taken into account
in the calibration. The calibration is done with a genetic algorithm in a way similar as in ??. The Fig. 3
shows the obtained Pareto fronts, and the Fig. 4 the evolution in time of parameter values for the optimal
solutions.
We observe a large variability of the shape of Pareto fronts for the bi-objective calibration on population
and distance, what witnesses more or less difficulty to simultaneously adjust population and distance. Some
periods, such as 1891-1911 and 1921-1936, are close to have a simultaneous objective point for the two
objectives, what would correspond to a good correspondence of the model to both trajectories of cities
and trajectory of the network on these periods.
In comparison with calibration results of the model with static network of ??, when comparing the
performances for the objective ε G , we find periods where the static is clearly better (1831 and 1841 for
example) and others where the co-evolutive model is better (1946 and 1962): thus, taking into account
the co-evolution helps in some cases to have a better reproduction of population trajectories.
The values of optimal parameters in time, shown in Fig. 4, seem to contain some signal. The evolution
of w G and γ G are coherent with the evolutions observed for the static model. For d G , the model principally
saturates on the maximal distance and the evolution is difficult to interpret.
However, the evolution of φ 0 could be a sign of a “TGV effect” in recent periods, through the secondary
peak for population after 1960. Indeed, the construction of high speed lines has shortened distances
between cities on top of the hierarchy, and an increase of the threshold φ 0 corresponds to an increase of
the selectivity for a potential diminution of distances.
The calibrated g max can finally be interpreted according to the history of the railway network (at least
of all points in the Pareto front): a significant secondary peak in the first years, a minimum in the years
corresponding to the stabilization of the network (1900), and an increase until today linked to the increase
of train speeds and the opening of high speed lines.
We have this way in a certain extent indirectly quantify interaction processes through the network and
the processes of network adaptation to flows, in the case of a real system.
3.3.4
Model with a physical network
We now sketch the outline of a specification of the model with a physical network, what would in a sense
correspond to an hybrid model combining different scales. The objective of such a specification would
be on the one hand to study the difference in trajectories compared to the abstract network, i.e. to
quantify the importance of economies of scale (due to common links), of congestion and also the possible
compromises to take in order to spatialize the network. On the other hand, it would help to understand
11Figure 3: Pareto fronts for the bi-objective calibration between population and distance.
Fronts are given for each calibration period and are colored according to g max .
12Figure 4: Temporal evolution of optimal parameters. From left to right and top to bottom, val-
ues of parameters (r 0 , w G , d G , γ G , φ 0 , g max ), respectively for the full Pareto front (blue), for the optimal
point in the sense of the distance (red) and the optimal point in the sense of the population (green).
to what extent it is possible to produce realistic networks in comparison to autonomous network growth
models for example. These issues are tackled at an other scale and for other ontological specifications in
chapter ??.
Such a specification follows the frame of [Li et al., 2014], which model the co-evolution between trans-
portation corridors and the growth of main poles at a regional scale.
The physical network we implement aims at satisfying a greedy criteria of local time gain. More
precisely, we assume a self-reinforcement similar to [Tero et al., 2010] A specification analog to the one
used before assumes a growth for each link, given also in a logic of self-reinforcement by:


 γ s 
φ
d(t + 1) = d(t) · 1 + g max ·
max φ
if φ is the flow in the link and d(t) its effective distance. The threshold specification used before
does indeed not allow a good convergence in time, in particular with the emergence of local oscillation
phenomena.
We generate a random initial network, by perturbing the position of vertices of a grid for which a fixed
proportion of links has been removed (40%) and by linking cities to the network through the shortest path.
Links have all the same impedance, which then evolves according to the equation above. An example of a
configuration obtained with this specification is given in Fig. 5. The good convergence properties (visual
stabilization of network structure during restricted experiments) suggest the potentialities offered by this
specification, which systematic exploration is out of the scope of this work.

dom configuration, with uniform impedances; (Right) Final configuration obtained after 100 iterations.

Discussion
Application
The study of particular trajectories within a system of cities can allow to answer to specific thematic
questions: for example, the influence of medium-sized cities on the global trajectory of the system, or the
drivers of a more or less “successful” trajectory for this type of profile. In the case of the application to a
real system, the mapping of deviation to the model in time can suggest regional particularities.
4.2
Developments
We also finally expect to be able through the model to compare urban systems in different geographical and
political contexts, and at different scales. This should foster the understanding the implications of planning
actions on the interactions between networks and territories. For example, French railway network has
emerged through multiple operators, on the contrary to the Chinese high speed railway network, for which
a more precise development could be considered.
