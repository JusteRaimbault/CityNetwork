\section*{Abstract}



We propose a stochastic model of urban growth that generates spatial distributions of population densities, at an intermediate scale between economic models at the macro scale and land-use evolution models focusing on local relations. Integrating simply the two opposite key processes of aggregation (``preferential attachment'') and diffusion (urban sprawl), we show that we can capture the whole spectrum of existing urban forms in Europe. An extensive exploration and calibration of the proposed model allows determining the region of parameter space corresponding morphologically to observed european urban systems, providing an validated thematic interpretation to model parameters, and furthermore determining the effective dimension of the urban system at this scale regarding morphological objectives.

\section*{Introduction}

Urban Systems are complex socio-technical objects




% - > literature on stochastic urban growth, ABM for Urban Growth, CA Models and urban morphogenesis models. Reproducing urban growth at different scales, capturing different processes.
% ⇒ Plus réponse à cette question : pourquoi simuler la croissance urbaine (quels enjeux scientifiques et sociaux ?)

% Macro models (Gibrat and extensions) are partially spatialized (Favaro - Pumain includes distance between cities, Simpops/Marius also) whereas micro (most CA) are ‘’over-spatialized’’ (neighborhood-based).  
% -> Research Question :  What about a simple model at the meso scale, close to macro by the stylized facts (preferential attachment) but producing morphologically consistent spatial distribution of densities ?



\cite{andersson2002urban} propose a micro-based model of urban growth, with the purpose to replace non-interpretable physical mechanisms with agent mechanisms, including interactions forces and mobility choices. Local correlations are used in \cite{makse1998modeling} to modulate growth patterns to ressemble real configurations. In the same spirit, our model situates at similar scales and can be qualified as a morphogenesis model. % model already described in \cite{makse1995modelling}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{The urban growth model}




\paragraph{Rationale}

%Preferential attchment and diffusion, extension of [Batty, 2006]. small litt. prefAtt and then Urban sprawl, opposed forces that must shape morphology of urban systems. choice of a scale at which spatial form has a sense but city system is ‘’wide enough” : 50-100km, meso-scale ?


% \cite{2016arXiv160806313S} : how Simon model generates power law (paper more general to be quoted ?) ; first mover : path dependency of obtained shapes.


% following Florent : \cite{fujita1996economics} oppose agglomeration and sprawl

Our model is based on widely accepted ideas of diffusion-aggregation processes for Urban Processes. The combination of attraction forces with repulsion, due for example to congestion, already yield a complex outcome that has been shown under some simplifying assumptions to be representative of urban growth processes. Such a model is studied by~\cite{batty2006hierarchy}. Indeed, the tension between antagonist aggregation and sprawl mechanisms may be an important process in urban morphogenesis. For example \cite{fujita1996economics} opposes centrifugal forces with centripetal forces in the equilibrium view of urban spatial systems, what is easily transferable to non-equilibrium systems in the framework of self-organized complexity : a urban structure is a far-from-equilibrium system that has been driven to this point by these opposite forces. The two contradictory processes of urban concentration and urban sprawl are captured by the model, what allows to reproduce with a good precision a large number of existing morphologies.


\paragraph{Scale}

% choice of scale : linked to the notion of morphogenesis

The question at which scale is it relevant to quantify urban scale is a difficult one, that probably has no unique response


\paragraph{Settings}

We formalize now the model, together with its parameters and their possible interpretations. The simulation model $D$ proceeds iteratively the following way. An square grid of width $N$, initially empty, is represented by population $(P_i(t))_{1\leq i\leq N^2}$. At each time step, until total population reaches a fixed parameter $P_m$,

\begin{itemize}
\item total population is increased of a fixed number $N_G$ (growth rate), following a preferential attachment such that 
\[\Pb{P_i(t+1)=P_i(t)+1|P(t+1)=P(t)+1}=\frac{(P_i(t)/P(t))^{\alpha}}{\sum(P_i(t)/P(t))^{\alpha}}\]
\item a fraction $\beta$ of population is diffused to four closest neighbors is operated $n_d$ times
\end{itemize}





\subsection{Indicators}


% Literature on morphological analysis, method taken from [Le Nechet 2015] to qualify/quantify urban form. Why would form be relevant at this scale ? -> thematic references on variety of urban developments, rural settlements, etc. : form translates many spatial processes at this scale. [beware question of equifiniality : model is however themtically-based for processes].

\cite{guerois2008built} : sort of morphological analysis


% on other ways to quantify form ? -> ex fractal shape index ; recent research \cite{2016arXiv160808839C}

% Definition of indicators

%Indicators to qualify model outputs are morphological measures of population density, proposed in~\cite{le2015forme}, that are entropy, hierarchy, spatial auto-correlation, mean distance. 


As our model is only density-based, we propose to quantify its outputs through spatial morphology, i.e. characteristics of density spatial distribution. We need therefore quantities having a certain level of robustness and invariance. For example, two polycentric cities should be classified as morphologically close whereas a direct comparison of distributions (Earth Mover Distance e.g.) could give a very high distance between configurations depending on center positions. To tackle this issue, we refer to the Urban Morphology Analysis literature which proposes an extensive set of indicators to describe urban form~\cite{tsai2005quantifying}. The number of dimensions can be reduced to obtain a robust description with a few number of independent indicators~\cite{Schwarz201029}. For the choice of indicators, we follow the analysis done in~\cite{le2015forme} where a typology of large european cities is obtained in consistence with qualitative knowledge. Let denote $(P_i)_{1\leq i \leq N}$ the population of cells, sorted in decreasing order, $d_{ij}$ the distance between cells $i,j$, and $P=\sum_{i=1}^{N} P_i$ total population. The indicators are the following :

\begin{enumerate}
\item Rank-size slope $\gamma$, expressing the degree of hierarchy in the distribution, computed by fitting a power law distribution by $\ln{P_i/P_0} \sim k - \gamma\cdot \ln{i/i_0}$.
\item Distribution Entropy
\[
\mathcal{E} = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{P_i}{P}\cdot \ln{\frac{P_i}{P}}
\]
\item Spatial-autocorrelation given by Moran index, with simple spatial weights given by $w_{ij} = 1/d_{ij}$
\[
r = \frac{\sum_{i\neq j} w_{ij} \left(P_i - \bar{P}\right)\cdot\left(P_j - \bar{P}\right)}{\sum_{i\neq j} w_{ij} \sum_{i}{\left( P_i - \bar{P}\right)}^2}
\]
\item Mean distance between individuals, which captures population concentration
\[
\bar{d} = \sum_{i<j} \frac{P_i P_j}{P^2} \cdot d_{ij}
\]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Real Data}

%% Data source (density grid), computation methodology [comparison of sampling/smoothing to avoid bord effects ?] -> reals values of morpho indics on 50kmx50km grids, on all Europe.
%% + summary stats

%Figure : Distributions of indicators values for real dataset of european densities, computed on 50kmx50km grids, with 10km offset to avoid bord effects. [TODO : add log-normal/normal fits ? ]
%  -> cf Empirical Section

We compute morphological measure on real urban density data, namely the population density grid of th European Union at 100m resolution provided openly by Eurostat~\cite{eurostat}. The morphological measures used for calibration are the one described above that are the same used to classify model outputs. The calibration of the model is thus done on morphological objectives (entropy, hierarchy, spatial auto-correlation, mean distance). We show in Fig.~\ref{fig:empirical} maps giving values of indicators for France, to ease readability. Map of the full European union are available in~\nameref{S1_Text}. The choice of the resolution, the space range, and the shape of the window on which indicators are computed, is made according to the thematic specifications of the model : % TODO justifications
We however tested the sensitivity to window size and shape

\subsection*{Generating Synthetic Patterns}



%Precise description of the implementation (pub openmole exploration etc, importance of intensive computation)


The model was implemented in a first time in NetLogo~\cite{wilensky1999netlogo} for exploration and visualization purposes, later in \texttt{Scala} for performance reasons and easy integration into OpenMole~\cite{reuillon2013openmole} for HPC model exploration. Computation of indicator values on geographical data was done in \texttt{R} using the \texttt{raster} package~\cite{hijmans2015geographic}. Source code, processed data and results are available on the open repository of the project at \texttt{}. % TODO anonymize repo ?




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Generation of urban patterns.}


%variety of genered forms, examples of extreme shapes.


The model as few parameters but is able to generate a very wide variety of shapes, extending beyond existing forms. In particular, its dynamical nature allows through $P_m$ parameter to choose final regime that can be non-stationarity (generally chaotic shapes), semi-stationarity or full stationarity. Fig.~\ref{fig:densitygeneration} shows examples of generated shapes, and illustrates the variety of forms that can be produced by the model.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Model Behavior}

In the study of such a computational model of simulation, the lack of analytical tractability must be balanced by an extensive knowledge 

\paragraph{Convergence}



%convergence properties of indicators ; number of repetitions needed for consistence of results. [histograms and stats of $\sigma$ %TODO]

Indicators show good convergence property and bimodal statistical distribution for cumulated points in the parameter space confirm the existence of superposed regimes : gaussian distribution gives stationary configurations, whereas inverse log-normal distribution are close to real data shape and correspond to non-stationary regime. For one point and a large number of repetitions, we find that 50 repetitions are enough to obtain a 95\% confidence interval smaller than $\sigma$ around indicator mean. 



\paragraph{Exploration of parameter space}

Parameter space is explored using a grid in first experiments, than a Latin Hypercube Sampling exploration. Parameter bounds are $\alpha \in [0.2,2],\beta \in [0,0.1],n_d \in \{0,\ldots , 4\}, N_G \in [500,3000], P_m \in [2000,100000]$. Fig.\ref{fig:densityscatter} shows the result. We also use the parameter space exploration algorithm~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0138212} implemented in OpenMole, and obtain in Fig.~\ref{fig:densitypse} the lower bound in Moran-entropy plan, that unexpectedly exhibit a scaling relationship that we aim to explore further.

A statistical analysis (basic models) of indicator behaviors remains to be done and interpreted (one is done conjointly with network in paper corresponding to next section).




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Model Calibration}



\paragraph{Calibration Process}

We use a specific calibration process : a principal component analysis allows to maximize the cumulated distance between generated points and reals points. We select then the point cloud that overlaps real points in the (PC1,PC2) plan, given a distance threshold. Fig.~\ref{fig:densitycalib} shows the points we obtain for four different values of the threshold ranging from $10^{-6}$ to $10^{-3}$.

We select then the overlapping cloud at threshold $\theta$, by taking models output closer to real point cloud than $\theta$ in the (PC1,PC2) plan.}
\label{fig:densitycalib}
\end{figure}

% 3.3.3 - Calibration Results
\paragraph{Calibration refinement}

We plan in further work to extract the exact parameter space covering all real situations and provide interpretation of its shape (correlations between parameters). Its volume in different directions should give the relative importance of parameters.

%[possible development : application of Calibration Profile algo to check relative influence of parameters + ad hoc linear algebra on regression of 3.2.3 to do the same]




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Discussion}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Thematic interpretation of growth behavior}

We still need to interpret the positions of typical shapes within parameter space in order to confirm the thematic interpretation of parameters. Depending on results of calibration refinement, we may obtain necessary and sufficient parameters to explain growth at this scale and a corresponding interpretation.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Integration into a multi-scale growth model}

It could be possible to couple this model with a Gibrat (or Favaro-pumain) at Europa scale (macro) (with addition of consistence on migration constraints), where meso growth rates which were exogenous before are top-down determined, and bottom-up feedback is done through local aggregation level, influence importance of each area.









%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Conclusion}


In conclusion, this first modeling step provide an accurately calibrated spatial urban growth model at the mesoscopic scale that can reproduce any European urban pattern in terms of urban form. Further work is needed for an interpretation of parameter influence and the determination of effective independent dimensions of the urban system at this scale. We will use this model for other purposes in the following.
