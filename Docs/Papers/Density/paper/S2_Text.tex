\section*{S2 Text : Semi-analytical analysis of the simplified model}


\subsection*{Partial Differential Equation}

We propose to derive the PDE in a simplified setting. To recall the configuration given in main text, the system has one dimension, such that $x\in \left[0;1\right]$ with $1/\delta x$ cells of size $\delta x$, and we use the expected values of cell population $p(x,t) = \Eb{P(x,t)}$. We furthermore take $n_d=1$. Larger values would imply derivatives at an order higher than 2 but the following results on the existence of a stationary solution should still hold. 

Denoting $\tilde{p}(x,t)$ the intermediate populations obtained after the aggregation stage, we have

\[
\tilde{p}(x,t) = p(x,t) + N_g\cdot \frac{p(x,t)^{\alpha}}{\sum_x p(x,t)^{\alpha}}
\]

since all populations units are added independently. If $\delta x \ll 1$ then $\sum_x p^{\alpha} \simeq \int_x p(x,t)^{\alpha}dx$ and we write this quantity $P_{\alpha}(t)$. We furthermore write $p=p(x,t)$ and $\tilde{p} = \tilde{p}(x,t)$ in the following for readability.

The diffusion step is then deterministic, and for any cell not on the border ($0<x<1$), if $\delta t$ is the interval between two time steps, we have

\[
\begin{split}
p(x,t+\delta t) & = (1 - \beta) \cdot \tilde{p} + \frac{\beta}{2} \left[\tilde{p}(x-\delta x,t) + \tilde{p}(x+\delta x,t)\right]\\
& = \tilde{p} + \frac{\beta}{2} \left[\left(\tilde{p}(x+\delta x,t) - \tilde{p}\right) - \left(\tilde{p} - \tilde{p}(x-\delta x,t)\right)\right]
\end{split}
\]

Assuming the partial derivatives exist, and as $\delta x \ll 1$, we make the approximation $\tilde{p}(x+\delta x,t) - \tilde{p} \simeq \delta x\cdot \frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial{x}}(x,t)$, what gives 

\[
\left(\tilde{p}(x+\delta x,t) - \tilde{p}\right) - \left(\tilde{p} - \tilde{p}(x-\delta x,t)\right) = \delta x \cdot \left(\frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial{x}}(x,t) - \frac{\partial \tilde{p}}{\partial{x}}(x - \delta x,t)\right)
\]

and therefore at the second order

\[
p(x,t+\delta t) = \tilde{p} + \frac{\beta \delta x}{2}
\]



\subsection*{Characteristic stationary distance}






\subsection*{Randomness and bifurcations}

The previous analyses were done on a deterministic version of the system. How can randomness influence the final configuration ?
