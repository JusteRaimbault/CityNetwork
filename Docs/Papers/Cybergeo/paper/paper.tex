\begin{abstract}
Patterns of interdisciplinarity in science can be quantified through diverse complementary dimensions. This paper studies as a case study the scientific environment of a generalist journal in Geography, \emph{Cybergeo}, in order to introduce a novel methodology combining citation network analysis and semantic analysis. We collect a large corpus of 200,000 articles with their abstracts and the corresponding citation network. Relevant keywords are extracted for each article through text-mining, allowing to construct a semantic classification. We show the complementarity of the citation and of the semantic classifications and their associated interdisciplinarity measures. The tools we develop accordingly are open and reusable for similar large scale studies of scientific environments.

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


The development of interdisciplinary approaches is increasingly necessary for most of disciplines, both for further knowledge discovery but also societal impact of discoveries, as it was recently by the special issue of Nature~\citep{natureInterdisc}. \cite{banos2013pour} suggests they must occur within a subtle spiral between and inside disciplines. An other way to understand this phenomenon is through the emergence of vertically integrated fields conjointly with horizontal questions as detailed in the Complex Systems roadmap (\cite{2009arXiv0907.2221B}). There are naturally ongoing debates on what is exactly interdisciplinarity (many other terms such as trans-disciplinarity, cross-disciplinarity also exist) and it actually depends of involved domains : recent hybrid disciplines (see e.g. the ones underlined  by \cite{bais2010praise} such as astro-biology) are a good illustration of the case where entanglement is strong and new discoveries are vertically deep, whereas more loose fields such as ``urbanism'', which have no precise definition and where integration is by essence horizontal, are an other illustration of how transversal knowledge can be produced. Interaction between disciplines are not always smooth, as shows the misunderstandings when urban issues were recently introduced to physicists as \cite{dupuy2015sciences} recalls.


These concerns are part of an understanding of processes of knowledge production, i.e. the \emph{Knowledge of the knowledge} as \cite{morin1986methode} puts it, in which evidence-based perspectives, involving quantitative approaches, play an important role. These paradigms can be understood as a \emph{quantitative epistemology}. Quantitative measures of interdisciplinarity would therefore be part of a multidimensional approach of the study of science that is in a way ``beyond bibliometrics''~\citep{cronin2014beyond}. The focus of this paper is positioned within this stream of research. We first review existing approaches to the measure of interdisciplinarity.


The possible methods for quantitative insights into epistemology are numerous. A good illustration of the variety of approaches is given by network analysis Using citation network features, a good predicting power for citation patterns is for example obtained by~\cite{2013arXiv1310.8220N}. Co-authorship networks can also be used for predictive models~\citep{2014arXiv1402.7268S}. A multilayer network approach was proposed in~\cite{omodei2017evaluating}, using bipartites networks of papers and scholars, in order to produce measures of interdisciplinarity using generalized centrality measures. Disciplines can be stratified into layers to reveal communities between them and therein collaboration patterns~\citep{2015arXiv150601280B}. Keyword networks are used in other fields such as economics of innovation: for example, \cite{choi2014patent} proposes a method to identify technological opportunities by detecting important keywords from the point of view of topological measures. In a similar manner, \cite{shibata2008detecting} uses topological analysis of the citation network to detect emerging research fronts.


\cite{moreno2016uncertainty} extend Rao Stirling measure to take unto account uncertainty

\cite{huutoniemi2010analyzing} recall the difference between \emph{multidisciplinary} (an aggregate of works from different disciplines) and \emph{interdisciplinary} (implying a certain level of integration) approaches. They construct a qualitative framework to classify types of interdisciplinarity, and for example distinguish empirical, theoretical and methodological interdisciplinarities.




We develop in this paper a case study coupling citation network exploration and analysis with text-mining, aiming at mapping the scientific landscape in the neighborhood of a particular journal. The choice of the journal yield several challenges and issues that make it particularly relevant for our study. It is an electronic journal in theoretical and quantitative geography, named \textit{Cybergeo}\footnote{\texttt{http://cybergeo.revues.org/}}. First of all, the discipline of Geography is very broad and by essence interdisciplinary: the spectrum ranges from Human and Critical geography to physical geography and geomorphology. Secondly, bibliographical data is difficult to obtain, raising the concern of how the perception of a scientific landscape may be shaped by actors of the dissemination and thus far from objective, making technical solutions as the ones consequently developed here crucial tools for an open and neutral science. Finally it makes a particularly interesting case study as the editorial policy is generalist and concerned with open science issues such as peer-review ethics transparency~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0147913}, data and model practices, etc. 


Our approach combine semantic communities analysis (as done in~\cite{2016arXiv160208451P} for papers in physics but with keyword extraction ; \cite{2015arXiv151003797G} analyses semantic networks of political debates) with citation network to extract e.g. interdisciplinarity measures. Our contribution differs from the previous works quantifying interdisciplinarity as it does not assume predefined domains nor classification of the considered papers, but reconstructs from the bottom-up the fields with the endogenous semantic information. \cite{nichols2014topic} already introduced a close approach, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to characterize interdisciplinarity of awards in particular sciences. \cite{lariviere201410} quantifies interdisciplinarity over a long time range by looking at the field of references of publications.



The rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe in the next section the dataset used and the data collection procedure.

 We then give in section~\ref{sec:results} results on interdisciplinarity landscape obtained through network multilayer analysis of the dataset, which are finally discussed in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Database Construction}
\label{sec:data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



Our approach imposes some requirements on the dataset used, namely: (i) cover a certain neighborhood of the studied journal in the citation network in order to have a consistent view on the scientific landscape; (ii) have at least a textual description for each node. For these to be met, we need to gather and compile data from heterogeneous sources, using therefore a specific application, which general architecture is given in Fig.~\ref{fig:datacollection}. Source code is available on the \texttt{git} repository of the project at \texttt{}.


For the sake of simplicity, we will denote by \emph{reference} any standard scientific production that can be cited by another (journal paper, book, book chapter, conference paper, communication, etc.) and contains basic records (title, abstract, authors, publication year). We will work in the following on networks of references. Note that one significant contribution of this paper is the construction of such an hybrid dataset from heterogeneous sources, and the development of associated tools that can be reused and further developed for similar purposes.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Initial Corpus}

The production database of \textit{Cybergeo} (snapshot taken in February 2016), provided by the editorial board, provides after pre-processing the initial database of articles, with basic information (title, abstract, publication year, authors). The processed version used is available together with the full database constructed, as a \texttt{mysql} dump, at \texttt{}. This base provide also bibliographical records of articles that give all references cited by the initial base (\emph{forward citations} for the initial corpus).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Citation Data}

Citation data is collected from \texttt{Google Scholar}, that is the only source for incoming citations~\cite{noruzi2005google} in our case as the journal is poorly referenced in other databases\footnote{or was just added as in the case of \textit{Web of Science}, indexing \textit{Cybergeo} since May 2016 only}. We are aware of the possible biaises using this single source (see e.g.~\cite{bohannon2014scientific})\footnote{or \texttt{http:\/\/iscpif.fr\/blog\/2016\/02\/the-strange-arithmetic-of-google-scholars}}, but these critics are more directed towards search results or possible manipulations than citation counts. The automatic collection requires the use of an open source data crawling software to pipe requests, namely \texttt{TorPool}~\citep{torpool} that provides a Java API allowing an easy integration into our application of data collection. A crawler can therethrough retrieve html pages and get backward citation data, i.e. all citing articles for a given initial article. We retrieve that way two sub-corpuses: references citing papers in \textit{Cybergeo} and references \emph{citing the ones cited} by \textit{Cybergeo}. At this stage, the full corpus contains around $4\cdot10^5$ references.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Text Data}

A textual description for all references is necessary for a complete semantic analysis. We use for this an other source of data, that is the online catalog of \textit{Mendeley} reference manager software~\cite{mendeley}. It provides a free API allowing to get various records under a structured format. Although not complete, the catalog provides a reasonable coverage (over 55\%), yielding a final corpus with full abstracts of size $2.1\cdot 10^5$. The structure and descriptive statistics of the corresponding citation network is recalled in Fig.~\ref{fig:citationnetwork}.

\subsection*{Citation Network Properties}

\paragraph{Properties}

% summary stats : should be in data description ?
As detailed above, we are able by the reconstruction of the citation network at depth $\pm 1$ from the original 1000 references of the journal to retrieve around $45\cdot 10^6$ references, on which $2.1\cdot 10^5$ are retrieved with abstract text allowing semantic analysis. A first glance on citation network properties provides useful insights. Mean in-degree (that can be interpreted as a stationary integrated impact factor) on references where it is defined has a value of $\bar{d}=$ % TODO
, whereas for articles in \textit{Cybergeo} we have $\bar{d}=3.18$. This difference suggests a variety for status of references, which is confirmed by the hierarchical organisation showed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ranksize} with the three superposed regimes. Other topological properties of the citation network reveal typical patterns: for example, the existence of high-order cliques implies certain citation practices which compatibility with the cumulative nature of knowledge may be questionable~\cite{pumain2005cumulativite}.

\subsection*{Semantic Communities Construction}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Relevant Keywords Extraction}

We recall that our corpus with available text consists of around $2\cdot 10^5$ abstracts of publications at a topological distance shorter than 2 from the journal \textit{Cybergeo} in the citation network.


Text processing is done with the method used by~\cite{bergeaud2017classifying}. We use the python library \texttt{nltk}~\cite{bird2006nltk} that provides state-of-the-art operations in Natural Language Processing. We add a particular treatment for language detection with \emph{stop-words}~\cite{baldwin2010language}.


We then use a specific tagger, \texttt{TreeTagger}~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}, for  languages other than english. To summarize, the relevant keywords extraction workflow goes through the following steps :


\begin{enumerate}
\item Language detection using \textit{stop-words}
\item Parsing and tokenizing / pos-tagging (word functions) / stemming done differently depending on language :
\begin{itemize}
\item English : \texttt{nltk} built-in pos-tagger, combined to a \emph{PorterStemmer}
\item French or other : use of \texttt{TreeTagger}~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}
\end{itemize}
\item Selection of potential \textit{n-grams} (with $1 \leq n \leq 4$) following the given patterns: for English $\bigcap \{NN \cup VBG \cup JJ \}$, and for French $\bigcap \{NOM \cup ADJ\}$. Other languages are a negligible proportion of the corpus and are discarded.
\item Estimation of \textit{n-grams} relevance, following co-occurrences statistical distribution
\end{enumerate}

% \item Database insertion for instantaneous utilisation (reducing effective time from 10 days to 2 minutes)



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Semantic Network}


We keep a fixed number $K_W$ of keywords, based on their relevance score.

most relevant keywords yield the co-occurrence matrix that can be directly interpreted as a weighted adjacency matrix. 

% TODO what value of K_W ; WHY ?







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Sensitivity Analysis}


The topology of raw networks does not allow the extraction of clear communities, in particular because of the presence of hubs that correspond to frequent terms common to many fields (e.g. \texttt{model}, \texttt{space}). We assume these highest degree terms do not carry specific information on particular classes and can be thus filtered given a maximal degree threshold $k_{max}$. Similarly, edges with low weight (i.e. rare co-occurrences) are considered as noise and are filtered accordingly to a minimal edge weight threshold $\theta_w$. Keywords are preliminary filtered by a document frequency window $\left[ f_{min},f_{max} \right]$ which is slightly different from network filtering and complementary.

A sensitivity analysis of resulting network topology to these parameters is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivity}. We choose parameter values that maximize modularity under the constraint of a community number and size distribution of same magnitude as technological classes. This multi-objective optimization does not have a unique solution as objectives are somehow contradictory, and a compromise point must be chosen. We take

\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Semantic Communities}

We then retrieve communities in the semantic network (using standard Louvain algorithm, with the optimized filtering parameters). At the exception of a small proportion apparently resulting from noise (representing less than 10 keywords, i.e. 0.33\% of keywords), communities correspond to well-defined scientific fields (and/or domains, approaches). An expert validation allow us to give names to these, in order to stick here to a certain level of supervision. Table~\ref{tab:domains} summarizes the communities, giving their names, sizes, and corresponding most relevant keywords. 


%a more elaborated naming procedure would eventually be possible (as in~\cite{} for the case of patents % TODO cite patent paper with community naming where a chi-square test on distribution of documents in classes)

Filtering parameters are here taken according to the multi-objective optimization done in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivity}, i.e. $(k_{max}=,e_{th}=,f_{min},f_{max}=)$. The graph spatialization algorithm (Fruchterman-Reingold), despite its stochastic and path-dependent character, unveils information on the relative positioning of communities.}

\subsection*{Measuring interdisciplinarity}





Distribution of keywords within reconstructed disciplines provides an article-level interdisciplinarity, and we can construct various measures at the journal level. Combination of citation and semantic layers in the hyper-network provide second order interdisciplinarity measures.

More precisely, a reference can be viewed as a probability vector on semantic classes



Given this setting, we simply measure interdisciplinarity using Herfindhal concentration index~\cite{porter2009science}

% Discussion max 1.5 pages in small sample of papers
%  -> short and concrete


\paragraph{Comparison of journals}

The construction of null models for comparison and the collection of currently missing data (journals for other papers) are currently ongoing so these results are not presented here.


\paragraph{Performance of the semantic classification}

A further validation of the relevance of using complementary information contained in the semantic classification could be done by the analysis of modularities within the citation network, as done in~\cite{bergeaud2017classifying}. This would however require a baseline classification to compare with, which is not available in the type of data we use. Open repository such as arXiv or Repec provide API to access metadata including abstracts, and could be starting points for such targeted case studies.
