\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most of scientific disciplines seem to be in a need of more interdisciplinarity and transversal approaches, as highlighted by the special issue of Nature (\cite{natureInterdisc}), for diverse reasons that may include the development of vertically integrated fields conjointly with horizontal questions as detailed in the Complex Systems roadmap (\cite{2009arXiv0907.2221B}). There are naturally ongoing debates on what is exactly interdisciplinarity (many other terms such as trans-disciplinarity, cross-disciplinarity also exist) and it actually depends of involved domains : recent hybrid disciplines (see e.g. the ones underlined  by \cite{bais2010praise} such as astro-biology) are a good illustration of the case where entanglement is strong and new discoveries are vertically deep, whereas more loose fields such as ``urbanism'' which has no precise definition and integration is by essence horizontal is an other illustration of how transversal knowledge can be produced (leading to misunderstandings when recently introduced to non-aware physicists as warned by~\cite{dupuy2015sciences}). This question projects itself naturally into the field of scientific communication : what are corresponding alternatives for an efficient dissemination of knowledge ? Elements of answer to such a high-level issue imply, in an evidence-based perspective, quantitative measures of interdisciplinarity, that would be part of a multidimensional approach of the study of science that is in a way ``beyond bibliometrics'' (\cite{cronin2014beyond}).

The possible methods for quantitative insights into epistemology are numerous. %Existing works in quantitative epistemology using various types of networks have shown interesting potentialities.
 Using citation network features, a good predicting power for citation patterns is for example obtained by~\cite{2013arXiv1310.8220N}. Co-authorship networks can also be used for predictive models (\cite{2014arXiv1402.7268S}). A multilayer network approach was recently proposed in~\cite{2016arXiv160106075O}, using bipartites networks of papers and scholars, in order to produce measures of interdisciplinarity. Disciplines can be stratified into layers to reveal communities between them and therein collaboration patterns (\cite{2015arXiv150601280B}). Keyword networks are used in other fields such as economics of innovation: for example, \cite{choi2014patent} proposes a method to identify technological opportunities by detecting important keywords from the point of view of topological measures. \cite{shibata2008detecting} uses topological analysis of the citation network to detect emerging research fronts.


We develop in this paper a case study coupling citation network exploration and analysis with text-mining, aiming at mapping the scientific landscape in the neighborhood of a particular journal. The choice of the journal yield several challenges and issues that make it particularly relevant for our study. It is an electronic journal in theoretical and quantitative geography, named \textit{Cybergeo}\footnote{\texttt{http://cybergeo.revues.org/}}. First of all, the discipline of Geography is very broad and by essence interdisciplinary: the spectrum ranges from Human and Critical geography to physical geography and geomorphology. Secondly, bibliographical data is difficult to obtain, raising the concern of how the perception of a scientific landscape may be shaped by actors of the dissemination and thus far from objective, making technical solutions as the ones consequently developed here crucial tools for an open and neutral science. Finally it makes a particularly interesting case study as the editorial policy is generalist and concerned with open science issues such as peer-review ethics transparency~\cite{10.1371/journal.pone.0147913}, data and model practices, etc. Our approach combine semantic communities analysis (as done in~\cite{2016arXiv160208451P} for papers in physics but with keyword extraction ; \cite{2015arXiv151003797G} analyses semantic networks of political debates) with citation network to extract e.g. interdisciplinarity measures. Our contribution differs from the previous works quantifying interdisciplinarity as it does not assume predefined domains nor classification of the considered papers, but reconstructs from the bottom-up the fields with the endogenous semantic information. \cite{nichols2014topic} already introduced a close approach, using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to characterize interdisciplinarity of awards in particular sciences. \cite{lariviere201410} quantifies interdisciplinarity over a long time range by looking at the field of references of publications.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows : we describe in section~\ref{sec:data} the nature of the dataset used and the data collection procedure. We then give in section~\ref{sec:results} results on interdisciplinarity landscape obtained through network multilayer analysis of the dataset, which are finally discussed in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Database Construction}
\label{sec:data}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% precise what we mean by reference ? !! it is scientometrics, may require precise use of terms

Our approach imposes some requirements on the dataset used, namely: (i) cover a certain neighborhood of the studied journal in the citation network in order to have a consistent view on the scientific landscape; (ii) have at least a textual description for each node. For these to be met, we need to gather and compile data from heterogeneous sources, using therefore a specific application, which general architecture is synthesized in Fig.~\ref{fig:datacollection}. For the sake of simplicity, we will denote by \emph{reference} any standard scientific production that can be cited by another (journal paper, book, book chapter, conference paper, communication, etc.) and contains basic records (title, abstract, authors, publication year). We will work in the following on networks of references. Note that one significant contribution of this paper is the construction of such an hybrid dataset from heterogeneous sources, and the development of associated tools that can be reused and further developed for similar purposes.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Initial Corpus}

The production database of \textit{Cybergeo} (snapshot dump taken at date), provided by the editorial board, provides after pre-processing the initial database of articles, with basic information (title, abstract, publication year, authors). The processed version used is available together with the full database constructed, as a \texttt{mysql} dump, at \texttt{}. This base provide also bibliographical records of articles that give all references cited by the initial base (\emph{forward citations} for the initial corpus).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Citation Data}

Citation data is collected from \texttt{Google Scholar}, that is the only source for incoming citations~\cite{noruzi2005google} in our case as the journal is poorly in other databases\footnote{or was just added as in the case of \textit{Web of Science}, indexing \textit{Cybergeo} since May 2016}. We are aware of the possible biaises using this single source (see e.g.~\cite{bohannon2014scientific})\footnote{or \texttt{http:\/\/iscpif.fr\/blog\/2016\/02\/the-strange-arithmetic-of-google-scholars}}, but these critics are more directed towards search results than citation counts. The automatic collection requires the use of an open source data crawling software to pipe requests, namely \texttt{TorPool}~\cite{torpool} that provides a Java API allowing an easy integration into our application. Using it, a crawler can retrieve html pages and get backward citation data, i.e. all citing articles for a given initial article. We retrieve that way two sub-corpuses: references \emph{citing} Cybergeo and references \emph{citing the ones cited} by cybergeo. At this stage, the full corpus contains around $4\cdot10^5$ references.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Text Data}

A textual description for all references is necessary for a complete semantic analysis. We use for this an other source of data, that is the online catalog of \textit{Mendeley} reference manager software~\cite{mendeley}. It provides a free API allowing to get various records under a structured format. Although not complete, the catalog provides a reasonable coverage (over 55\%), yielding a final corpus with full abstracts of size $2.1\cdot 10^5$, which structure is recalled in Fig.~\ref{fig:citationnetwork}

\subsection*{Citation Network Properties}


% summary stats : should be in data description ?
As detailed above, we are able by the reconstruction of the citation network at depth $\pm 1$ from the original 1000 references of the journal to retrieve around $45\cdot 10^6$ references, on which $2.1\cdot 10^5$ are retrieved with abstract text allowing semantic analysis. A first glance on citation network properties provides useful insights. Mean in-degree (that can be interpreted as a stationary integrated impact factor) on references where it is defined has a value of $\bar{d}=$ % TODO
, whereas for \cite{cybergeo} we have $\bar{d}=3.18$. This difference suggests a variety for status of references, which is confirmed by the hierarchical organisation showed in Fig.~\ref{fig:ranksize} with the three superposed regimes. Other topological properties reveal typical patterns: for example, the existence of high-order cliques implies certain citation practices which compatibility with the cumulative nature of knowledge may be questionable~\cite{pumain2005cumulativite}.

\subsection*{Semantic Communities Construction}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Relevant Keywords Extraction}

Corpus consists of around $2\cdot 10^5$ abstracts of publications at a topological distance shorter than 2 from the journal \texttt{cybergeo} in the citation network.

Text processing is done using a method adapted from~\cite{chavalarias2013phylomemetic}. We use the python library \texttt{nltk}~\cite{bird2006nltk} that provides state-of-the-art operations in Natural Language Processing. A particular treatment is required for language detection with \emph{stop-words} and a specific tagger \texttt{TreeTagger} is used for other languages than english (\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}). More precisely, we go through the following steps :


\begin{enumerate}
\item Language detection using \textit{stop-words}
\item Parsing and tokenizing / pos-tagging (word functions) / stemming done differently depending on language :
\begin{itemize}
\item English : \texttt{nltk} built-in pos-tagger, combined to a \emph{PorterStemmer}
\item French or other : use of \texttt{TreeTagger}~\cite{schmid1994probabilistic}
\end{itemize}
\item Selection of potential \textit{n-grams} (with $1 \leq n \leq 4$) following the given patterns: for English $\bigcap \{NN \cup VBG \cup JJ \}$, and for French $\bigcap \{NOM \cup ADJ\}$
\item Database insertion for instantaneous utilisation (reducing effective time from 10 days to 2 minutes)
\item Estimation of \textit{n-grams} relevance, following co-occurrences statistical distribution
\end{enumerate}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Semantic Network}

% describe co-occurrence nw




Keeping the $K_W$ most relevant keywords yield the co-occurrence matrix that can be directly interpreted as a weighted adjacency matrix. 

% TODO what value of K_W ; WHY ?







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Sensitivity Analysis}


% sensitivity analysis to params/meta-params

The topology of raw networks does not allow the extraction of clear communities, in particular because of the presence of hubs that correspond to frequent terms common to many fields (e.g. \texttt{model}, \texttt{space}). We assume these highest degree terms do not carry specific information on particular classes and can be thus filtered given a maximal degree threshold $k_{max}$. Similarly, edge with small weight must not carry significant information and are filtered according to a minimal edge weight threshold $w_{min}$. Keywords are preliminary filtered by a document frequency window $\left[ f_{min},f_{max} \right]$ which is slightly different from network filtering and complementary. A sensitivity analysis of resulting network topology to these parameters is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:sensitivity}. We choose parameter values that maximize modularity under the constraint of a community number and size distribution of same magnitude as technological classes. This multi-objective optimization does not have a unique solution as objectives are somehow contradictory, and a compromise point must be chosen. We take

\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Semantic Communities}

We then retrieve communities in the semantic network (using standard Louvain algorithm, with the optimized filtering parameters). At the exception of a small proportion apparently resulting from noise (representing x/y, i.e. z\% of keywords) % TODO exact number 
, communities correspond to well-defined scientific fields (and/or domains, approaches). An expert validation allow us to give names to these, a more complicated naming procedure would eventually be possible (as in~\cite{} for the case of patents % TODO cite patent paper with community naming
 where a chi-square test on distribution of documents in classes), but we prefer to stick here to a certain level of supervision. Table~\ref{tab:domains} summarizes the communities

\subsection*{Measures of Interdisciplinarity}





Distribution of keywords within reconstructed disciplines provides an article-level interdisciplinarity, and we can construct various measures at the journal level. Combination of citation and semantic layers in the hyper-network provide second order interdisciplinarity measures.

More precisely, a reference can be viewed as a probability vector on semantic classes
