\begin{abstract}
We propose a simple model of urban growth for systems of cities, which investigate in particular the role of physical networks on interdependence of growth rates. Under the assumption of stochastic independence, a generalized non-linear formulation of recursive population growth captures spatial interactions between cities. At the second order, feedback of physical network, introduced as an abstraction of transportation network, is introduced as influencing average growth rates. Model exploration and calibration using large-scale computation and specific algorithms, yield typical characteristics of spatial interaction, such as decay distance, and their evolution in time under non-stationarity hypothesis. Furthermore, network effects are revealed by a fit improvement when adding network module.

\section*{Introduction}


Cities are paradoxically both unsustainable and source of negative externalities, but also the best chance to reach sustainability and resilience to climate change~\citep{glaeser2011triumph}. The dynamics of Urban Systems at a macroscopic scale, and more precisely drivers of urban growth, are crucial to be understood to meet these potentialities. A better knowledge of how cities differentiate, interact and grow is thus a relevant topic both for policy application and from a theoretical perspective. \cite{pumain2009innovation} suggests that cities are incubators of social change, their fate being closely linked to the one of societies. Various disciplines have studied models of urban growth with different objectives and taking diverse aspects into account. For example, Economics are still reluctant to include spatial interactions in the models~\citep{krugman1998space} but are extremely detailed on market processes, even for models in Economic Geography, whereas Geography focuses more on territorial specificities and interactions in space but will produce general conclusion with more difficulty. The example of this two disciplines shows how it is difficult to make bridges, as it needed exceptional efforts to translate from one to the other (as P. Hall did for Von Thunen work~\citep{taylor2016polymath}), and therefore how it is far from evident to grasp the complexity of Urban Systems in an integrated way.


The simplest model to explain urban growth, the Gibrat model, that assumes random growth rates, has been shown by~\cite{gabaix1999zipf} to asymptotically produce the expected rank-size law (Zipf's law) for system of cities which is considered as one of the most regular stylized facts, at least in its generalized scaling law formulation~\citep{nitsch2005zipf}. Explaining urban scaling laws is closely related to the understanding of urban growth, as \cite{bettencourt2008large} suggests that these reflect underlying universal processes and that all cities are scaled version of each other. This approach however does not reflect the complex relation between economic agents for which~\cite{storper2009rethinking} advocates. Using a bottom reconstruction of urban areas using dynamical microscopic population data, \cite{rozenfeld2008laws} shows indeed that positive deviations to the rank-size law systematically exist, and that these must be an effect of spatial interaction between urban areas. Complexity approaches are good candidates to integrate these into models. \cite{andersson2006complex} introduce for example a model of urban economy as a growing complex network of relations. The Evolutive Urban Theory, introduced by~\cite{pumain1997pour}, focuses on cities as co-evolving entities and produces explanations for growth at the system of cities level. \cite{pumain2006evolutionary} shows that scaling laws could be due to functional differentiation and diffusion of innovation between cities. The positioning regarding universality of laws is more moderate than Scaling theories, as \cite{pumain2012urban} highlights that ergodicity can difficultly be assumed in the frame of complex territorial systems. One crucial feature of this paradigm is the importance of interactions between agents, generally the cities, to produce the emergent patterns at the scale of the system. \cite{pumain2013theoretical} has investigated the advantages of Agent-based models compared to more classical equation systems, and this methodological aspect is in accordance with the theoretical positioning, as it allows to take into account the heterogeneity of possible interactions, the geographical particularities, and to naturally translate emergence between levels and render multi-scale patterns.


In this paper we aim at exploring further the assumption, central to Pumain's Evolutive Urban Theory, that spatial interactions between cities are significant drivers of their growth. More precisely, we consider both abstract interactions and flow interactions mediated through the physical networks, mainly transportation network. We extend existing models accordingly. Our contribution is twofold: (i) we show that very basic interaction models based on population only can be fitted to empirical data and that fitted parameter values are directly interpretable; and (ii) we introduce a novel methodology to quantify overfitting in models of simulation, as an extension of Information Criteria for statistical models, which applied to our calibrated models confirms that fit improvement is not only due to additional parameters, but that the extended model effectively capture more information on system processes. This will unveil network effects in an indirect way. We first review modeling approach to urban growth based on spatial interactions.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Urban Growth and Spatial Interaction}

First of all, we must precise that we consider only models at the macro-scale, ruling out the numerous and rich approaches at the mesoscopic scale, that include for exemple Cellular Automata models, models of Urban Morphogenesis or Land-use change models. We also naturally rule out economics models that do not include explicitly spatial interactions. Several models of Urban Growth at the macro scale have insisted on the role of space and spatial interactions. \cite{bretagnolle2000long} proposed a spatial extension of the Gibrat model. The gravity-based interaction model that~\cite{sanders1992systeme} use to apply concept of Synergetics to cities is also close to this idea of interdependent urban growth, contained physically in the phenomenon of migration between cities. A more refined extension with economic cycles and innovation waves was developed by~\cite{favaro2011gibrat}, yielding a system dynamics version of the core of Simpop models~\citep{pumain2012multi}. This family of models have started with a toy-model based on economic interactions between cities as agents, that yield hierarchical patterns at the scale of the system~\citep{sanders1997simpop}. Later, the Simpop2 model, still based on distance interaction for commercial exchanges, including successive innovation waves, unveiled structural differences between the European and the US Urban Systems~\citep{bretagnolle2010comparer}. The SimpopLocal model~\citep{pumain2017simpoplocal} is used to show the emergence of initial settlement patterns. The Marius model~\citep{cottineau2014evolution} couples population and economic growth with cities interaction, allowing to accurately reproduce real trajectories on the former Soviet Union after calibration with multi-modeling of processes.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Urban Growth and Transportation Networks}


Under similar assumptions of previously reviewed models, the inclusion of transportation networks has been rarely pursued, contrary to the mesoscopic scale at which relations between networks and territories have been widely studied by Luti models for example~\citep{chang2006models}. Network growth models~\citep{xie2009modeling}, prolific in Economics and Physics, can not be utilized to explain urban growth. \cite{bigotte2010integrated} studies an optimization model for network design combining the effects of urban hierarchy and of transportation network hierarchy. \cite{baptiste1999interactions} has modeled dynamical interplay between network links capacity and city growth on a subset of French city system. The SimpopNet model~\citep{schmitt2014modelisation} goes a step further in modeling the co-evolution between cities and transportation networks, as it allows new network links to be created in time. These examples shows the difficulty of coupling these two aspects of urban systems in models of growth, and we will for this reason take into account network effects in a simplified way as detailed further.


The rest of this paper is organized as follows : our model is introduced and formally described in next section; we then describe results obtained through exploration and calibration of the model on data for French cities, in particular the unveiling of network effects significantly influencing growth processes thanks to a novel methodology introduced. We finally discuss the implications of these results.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Model Description}




\paragraph{Rationale}


Some confusion may arise when surveying at stochastic and deterministic models of urban growth. To what extent is a proposed model ``complex'' and is the simulation of stochasticity necessary ? Concerning Gibrat model and most of its extensions, independence assumptions and linearity produce a totally predictable behavior and thus not complex in the sense of exhibiting emergence, in the sense of weak emergence~\citep{bedau2002downward}. In particular, the full distribution of random growth models can be analytically at any time~\cite{gabaix1999zipf}, and in the case of studying only first moment, a simple recurrence relation avoids to proceed to any Monte-Carlo simulation. Under these assumptions, it is natural to work with a deterministic model, as it is done for example for the Marius model~\cite{cottineau2014evolution}. We will work under that hypothesis, capturing complexity through non-linearity. We work on simple territorial systems assumed as regional city systems, in which cities are basic entities. The time scale corresponds to the characteristic scale associated to this spatial scale, i.e. around one or two centuries. Spatial interactions will be captured through gravity-type interactions, this simple formulation having the advantage of being simple and of capturing the first law of Tobler, namely that interaction strength fades with distance. Other approaches introduced recently perform similarly at this scale~\citep{masucci2013gravity}.


\paragraph{Model description}

We  consider on a deterministic extension of the Gibrat model, what is equivalent to consider only expectancies in time. Let $\vec{P}(t)=(P_i(t))_i$ be the population of cities in time. Under Gibrat independence assumptions, we have $\Covb{P_i(t)}{P_j(t)}=0$. A linear extended version would write $\vec{P}(t+1)=\mathbf{R}\cdot \vec{P}(t)$ where $\mathbf{R}$ is an independent random matrix of growth rates (identity in the original case). It yields directly thanks to the independence assumption that $\Eb{\vec{P}(t+1)}=\Eb{\mathbf{R}}\cdot\Eb{\vec{P}}(t)$. We generalize this linear relation to a non-linear relation that allows to be more consistent with model interpretation and more flexible. Denoting $\vec{\mu}(t)=\Eb{\vec{P}(t)}$, we take $\vec{\mu}(t+1)=\Delta t\cdot f(\vec{\mu}(t))$. Note that in that case, stochastic and deterministic versions are not equivalent anymore, precisely because of the non-linearity, but we stick to a simple deterministic version for the sake of simplicity. The specification of the interdependent growth rate is given by

\begin{equation}
f(\vec{\mu}) = r_0\cdot \mathbf{Id}\cdot \vec{\mu} + \mathbf{G}\left(\vec{\mu}\right)\cdot \vec{1} + \vec{N}\left(\vec{\mu}\right)
\end{equation}


where $\vec{1}$ is the column vector full of ones, and $\mathbf{G} = G_{ij} = w_G\cdot \frac{V_{ij}}{<V_{ij}>}$ such that the interaction potential $V_{ij}$ follows a gravity-type expression given by 

\begin{equation}
V_{ij} = \left(\frac{\mu_i\mu_j}{\sum{\mu_k}^2}\right)^{\gamma_G}\cdot \exp{(-d_{ij}/d_G)}
\end{equation}

The network effect term $\vec{N}$ is given by


\begin{equation}
N_{i} = w_N \cdot \sum_{kl} \left(\frac{\mu_k\mu_l}{\sum\mu}\right)^{\gamma_N} \cdot \exp{(-d_{kl,i})/d_N}
\end{equation}

where $d_{kl,i}$ is the distance to shortest path between $k,l$ computed in the geographical space with slope impedance $Z=\left(1+\alpha/\alpha_0\right)^{n_0}$. The first component is the pure Gibrat model, that we obtain by setting the weights $w_G = w_N = 0$. The second component captures direct interdependencies between cities, under the form of a separable gravity potential such as the one used in~\cite{sanders1992systeme}. The rationale for the third term, aimed at capturing network effects by expressing a feedback of network flow between cities $k,l$ on the city $i$. Intuitively, a demographic and economic flow physically transiting through a city or in its surroundings is expected to influence its development (through intermediate stops e.g.), this effect being of course dependent on the transportation mode since a high speed line with few stops will skip most of the traversed territories.
 Under assumption of non-stationarity, temporal evolution of fitted parameters corresponding to this feedback should therefore contain information on the evolution of transportation modes.

\subsection*{Data}

\paragraph{Population data}

We work with the Pumain-INED historical database for French Cities~\cite{pumain1986fichier}, which give populations of \emph{Aires Urbaines} (INSEE definition) at time intervals of 5 years, from 1831 to 1999 (31 observations in time). The latest version of the database integrates Urban Areas, allowing to follow them on long time-period, according to Bretagnole's long time cities ontology~\cite{bretagnolle:tel-00459720}, that constructs a definition of cities as evolving entities which boundaries are not fixed in time.



\paragraph{Physical flows}

As stated above, this modeling exercise focuses on exploring the role of physical flows, whatever the effective shape of the network. We choose for this reason not to use real network data which is furthermore not easily available at different time periods, and physical flows are assumed to take the geographical shortest path that include terrain slope. It avoids geographical absurdities such as cities with a difficult access having an overestimated growth rate. Using a 1km resolution Digital Elevation Model, we construct an impedance field of the form

\[
Z = \left(1 + \frac{\alpha}{\alpha_0}\right)^{n_0}
\]

We take fixed parameter values $\alpha_0 = 3$ (corresponding to approximatively the real world value of a 5\% slope) and $n_0 = 3$. 



\paragraph{A semi-parametrized model}

Our model is assumed as hybrid as it relies on semi-parametrization on real data. It could be possible to be a full toy-model, initial configuration and physical environment being constructed as synthetic data. As~\cite{raimbault2016generation} points out, it should even be a step in an extensive study of model, using synthetic data to unveil sensibility of dynamics to meta-parameters defining setup. This enterprise is however out of the scope of this paper, as we aim here to extract advanced stylized facts from a dataset, and we focus therefore on the semi-parametrized version of the model.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Model Evaluation}

We work on an explanatory rather than an exploratory model. Therefore, indicators to evaluate model outputs are not directly linked to intrinsic properties of trajectories or obtained final states, but rather to a distance to the phenomenon we want to explain, i.e. the data. Given real population $p_i(t)$ (historical realizations of $P_i(t)$) and simulated expected populations $\mu_i(t)$ obtained with $\vec{\mu}(t_0) = \vec{p}(t_0)$

\begin{itemize}
\item Logarithms of mean-square error
\item Mean-square error on logarithms
\end{itemize}







%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Results}




\subsection*{Stylized facts}

Basic stylized facts can be extracted from such a database, as it has already been widely explored in the literature~\cite{guerin1990150}.

We show in figure~\ref{fig:ts-correlations} mean time-series correlation as a function of distance

More precisely, we consider overlapping 50 years time-windows finishing respectively in (1881,1906,1931,1962,1999) and compute on each, for each couple of cities $(i,j)$, an estimated correlation $\hat{\rho}_{ij}=\rho\left[\Delta \tilde{P}_i, \Delta \tilde{P}_j\right]$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Model Exploration}


\paragraph{Implementation}


Data preprocessing, result processing and models profiling are implemented in \texttt{R}. For performances reasons and an easier integration into the OpenMole software for model exploration described by~\cite{reuillon2013openmole}, a \texttt{scala} version was also developed. The typical question of trade-off between implementation performance and interoperability appeared quickly as an issue, as a blind exploration and calibration can difficultly provide useful thematic conclusions for that kind of model. Finding an improvement in model fit among one parameter dimension is significant if the geographical situation is visualized and the improvement is confirmed as reasonable and not an absurdity.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Calibrating the Gravity Model}


\cite{batty1972calibration}

saturation : better for logmse == error on big cities : a priori the interaction range would change with size - as potential development for future model

We propose to interpret the distance decay parameter the following way. Let fix an arbitrary fraction $\alpha$ and typical ranges for a local urban system $d_L$ and for a long range urban system $d_R$. Seeing $d_G$ as the decay at which the fraction $\alpha$ between the migration flow of these two systems is realized, we have $d_G = \frac{d_R - d_L}{\left| \ln{\alpha} \right|}$


\paragraph{Non-stationarity in time}




\paragraph{Calibration using Genetic Algorithms}


The optimization problem associated to model calibration does not present features allowing an easy solving (closed-form of a likelihood function, convexity or sparsity of the optimization problem, etc.), we must rely on alternative techniques to solve it. Brute force grid search is rapidly limited by the dimensionality curse

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Full Model Calibration}

We focus in this last experiment on quantifying the ``performance'' of the model, taking into account its predictive abilities, but also its structure. More precisely, we want to tackle the issue of overfitting, which has been for long recognized in Machine Learning for example~\cite{dietterich1995overfitting}, but for which there is a lack of methods for models of simulation.


\paragraph{Quantifying overfitting : Empirical AIC}


% \cite{2017arXiv170108673P} : selecting number of states in HMM, analog ?
% \cite{biernacki2000assessing} : other type of computational aic-type indicator.

\cite{2017arXiv170609773B} : model extraction - very similar, with different purpose

A large part of statistical models allow to compute tools for model comparison and selection, in particular to take into account possible overfitting due to additional degrees of freedom. The Akaike Information Criterion provides the gain in information between two models, and many extensions have been proposed since~\cite{}.% TODO cite AIC
Note that cross-validation type of methods are not suitable to our case because of the small size of the dataset. We can formalize the proposed method based on the intuitive idea of approaching models of simulation by statistical models and using the corresponding AIC under certain validity conditions. Let $(X,Y)$ be the data and observations. Computational models are functions $(X,\alpha_k) \mapsto M_{\alpha_k}^{(k)}(X)$ mapping data values to a random variable. What is seen as data and parameters is somehow arbitrary but is separated in the formulation as corresponding dimensions will have different roles. We assume the model has been fitted to data in the sense that an heuristic has been used to approximate $\alpha^{\ast}_k = \argmin_{\alpha_k}\norm{M_{\alpha_k}^{(k)}(X) - Y}$. The gain of information between two computational models is not directly accessible and we propose an indirect way, through the fitting of statistical models. For all computational model, a large set of statistical models with similar degree of freedom are fitted.

Let $S_k$ be the statistical models fitting best $M^{(k)}_{\alpha^{\ast}_k}(X)$. We can compute

\[
\Delta D_{KL} \left(M^{(1)}|M^{(2)}\right) = \Delta D_{KL} \left(S^{(1)}|S^{(2)}\right) + \left[ \Delta D_{KL} \left(S^{(2)}|M^{(1)}\right) + \Delta D_{KL} \left(S^{(1)}|M^{(2)}\right) \right]
\]

Under certain assumptions, the order of magnitude of second term appears to be negligible. More precisely, with $s^{(k)}=M^{(k)}-S^{(k)}$, we have

\[
\norm{\int f \log{\left(\frac{S^{(k)}}{M^{(k')}}\right)}} = \norm{\int f \log{\left(1 + \frac{s^{(k)}}{M^{(k')}}\right)}}
\]

\section*{Discussion}


%  - multimodeling etc
%  - back to the simple arg ? rgs argument also ?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Theoretical implications}

- how this example illustrates well the theory

We propose to support our hypothesis that \textit{physical transportation networks are necessary to explain the morphogenesis of territorial systems} (aka \textit{Network Necessity}) by showing on a relatively simple case that the integration of physical networks into some models effectively increase their explanative power (being careful on the precise definition of model improvement to avoid overfitting).

\subsection*{Methodological implications}

%  - reflexions on iterative calibration, here ?



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Further developments}


\paragraph{Specificity of the Urban System}

- not tested on other system of cities

The model has not yet been tested on other urban systems and other temporalities.



\paragraph{Towards co-evolutive models of cities and transportation networks}

- no network data -> development with train ?

Our focus on network effects remains quite limited since (i) we do not consider an effective infrastructure but abstract flows only, and (ii) we do not take into account the possible network evolution, due to technical progresses (\cite{bretagnolle2000long}) and infrastructure growth in time. An ambitious but necessary development would be the inclusion of both in a model of co-evolution between urban growth and transportation network growth, in order to investigate to what extent the refinement of network spatial structure and network dynamics can improve the explanation of urban system dynamics. It has been shown by \cite{raimbault2016models} that disciplinary compartmentalization may be at the origin of the relative absence of such type of models in the literature.



- bayesian iterative formulation ? (mcmc)
- how does formulation influence ? equivalence in certain cases between stoch-cov and interdependent expectancies ?
- Q under which conditions we can impose a covariance structure that produces interdependencies between expectancies ? seems to be a very broader question, need to do some thinking on that.

%For example, if your journal is short A4 sized, uses Times fonts and has Harvard style references then you would need\\
%{\small\verb+\documentclass[ShortAfour,times,sageh]{sagej}+}
%
%Most \textit{SAGE} journals are published using Times fonts but if for any reason you have a problem using Times you can
%easily resort to Computer Modern fonts by removing the
%\verb"times" option.

%\section{The body of the article}
%
%\subsection{Mathematics} \textsf{\journalclass} makes the full
%functionality of \AmS\/\TeX\ available. We encourage the use of
%the \verb"align", \verb"gather" and \verb"multline" environments
%for displayed mathematics. \textsf{amsthm} is used for setting
%theorem-like and proof environments. The usual \verb"\newtheorem"
%command needs to be used to set up the environments for your
%particular document.
%
%\subsection{Figures and tables} \textsf{\journalclass} includes the
%\textsf{graphicx} package for handling figures.
%
%Figures are called in as follows:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics{<figure name>}
%\caption{<Figure caption>}
%\end{figure}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%For further details on how to size figures, etc., with the
%\textsf{graphicx} package see, for example, \cite{R1}
%or \cite{R3}.
%
%The standard coding for a table is shown in Figure~\ref{F2}.

%\caption{Example table layout.\label{F2}}
%\end{figure}
%
%\subsection{Cross-referencing}
%The use of the \LaTeX\ cross-reference system
%for figures, tables, equations, etc., is encouraged
%(using \verb"\ref{<name>}" and \verb"\label{<name>}").
%
%\subsection{End of paper special sections}
%Depending on the requirements of the journal that you are submitting to,
%there are macros defined to typeset various special sections. \pagebreak
%
%The commands available are:
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{acks}
%To typeset an
%  "Acknowledgements" section.
%\end{acks}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{biog}
%To typeset an
%  "Author biography" section.
%\end{biog}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{biogs}
%To typeset an
%  "Author Biographies" section.
%\end{biogs}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{dci}
%To typeset a "Declaration of
%  conflicting interests" section.
%\end{dci}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{funding}
%To typeset a "Funding" section.
%\end{funding}
%\end{verbatim}
%\begin{verbatim}
%\begin{sm}
%To typeset a
%  "Supplemental material" section.
%\end{sm}
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\subsection{Endnotes}
%Most \textit{SAGE} journals use endnotes rather than footnotes, so any notes should be coded as \verb+\endnote{<Text>}+.
%Place the command \verb+\theendnotes+ just above the Reference section to typeset the endnotes.
%
%To avoid any confusion for papers that use Vancouver style references,  footnotes/endnotes should be edited into the text.
%


%
%\subsection{References}
%Please note that the files \textsf{SageH.bst} and \textsf{SageV.bst} are included with the class file
%for those authors using \BibTeX. For APA style references please use \textsf{mslapa.bst} which should be part of most modern \TeX\ distributions.
%
%See the above instructions regarding choosing the correct reference option.
