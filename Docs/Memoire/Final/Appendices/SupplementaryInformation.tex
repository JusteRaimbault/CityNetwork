This chapter gathers various technical developments, that have the common points to be not essential to the core of the thesis and difficult to digest.


This appendix also gathers more precise model explorations, generally needed to support conclusions in main text but too long or repetitive to be included.

%  -> as code, unreadable directly : put listing of statistical analysis
%   find a way to automatically generate stat anal files from R ?
