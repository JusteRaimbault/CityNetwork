\subsection{Introduction}{Introduction}

\bpar{
There is an increasing expectation on people to be aware and to get involved in the environmental issues that our world is facing. However, expert knowledge is often required to understand most of these issues. One of the challenges in science today lies in explaining complex issues in a simple and understandable way to an unspecialized audience. Games can turn out to be a good medium for scientific vulgarization. Indeed, the first form of learning we all experienced was by playing. Games are very popular, and from an educational point of view, they present many advantages. They are dynamic and interactive. Therefore, the player engagement increases, as well as its knowledge retention. In addition, the player is immerged into a new world and discovers a virtual environment where he needs to develop strategies and to identify crucial processes. Those characteristics can be wisely used to spread scientific topics, and gamification has already been proposed as a tool for an easier propagation of scientific thinking~\cite{morris2013gaming} such as in pharmacology~\cite{cain2015serious} or geosciences~\cite{reynard2015application}. In this context, our project aims at developing game-based tools to transmit the basic concepts of freshwater ecology. We choose to focus on a classical board game and on a computer based game because they are complementary in the targeted audience (groups versus online gamers) and the possibilities offered, in particular regarding the interactions between players and the system dynamics.

L'attente de prise de conscience et d'implication pour le public concernant les questions environnementales est croissante. Toutefois, une connaissance experte est souvent nécessaire pour comprendre le enjeux sous-jacents à la plupart de ces problèmes. L'un des défis de la science aujourd'hui réside dans le fait d'expliquer des questions complexes de façon simple et compréhensible à une audience non-spécialisée. Les jeux apparaissent comme un medium pertinent pour la vulgarisation scientifique. En effet, la première forme d'apprentissage est en général par le jeu. Les jeux sont très populaires et présentent divers avantages d'un point de vue éducatif. Ceux-ci sont dynamiques et interactifs. Ainsi, l'engagement du joueur est augmenté, ainsi que sa rétention de connaissances. De plus, le joueur est immergé dans un monde nouveau et découvre un environnement virtuel où il doit développer des stratégies et identifier les processus fondamentaux. Ces caractéristiques peuvent être aisément utilisées pour transmettre des concepts scientifiques, et la gamification a déjà été proposée comme un outil pour une meilleure propagation de la pensée scientifique~\cite{morris2013gaming} comme en pharmacologie~\cite{cain2015serious} ou les géosciences~\cite{reynard2015application}. Dans ce contexte, ce projet vise à développer des outils basés sur les jeux pour transmettre des concepts basiques en écologie d'eau douce. Nous nous intéressons à un jeu de plateau classique et à un jeu informatique car ceux-ci sont complémentaire dans l'audience visée (joueurs en groupe et joueurs en ligne) et dans les possibilités offertes, en particulier concernant les interactions entre joueurs et les dynamiques du système.

%Objective : TO DEVELOP A BOARD GAME AND A COMPUTER-BASED GAME TO EXPLAIN THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF AQUATIC ECOLOGY

\subsection{Material and Methods}{Méthodologie}

\bpar{
The general methodology is divided in five steps: (1) selection of species; (2) definition of the instructions (object, game board, rules); (3) incorporation of environmental stressors (biotic and abiotic), (4) design and construction of interfaces (board and computer model); (5) test with players. All steps are necessarily interdependent and are tackled in parallel during the development of the games.

La méthodologie pour la conception des deux types de jeux est divisée de manière similaire en 5 étapes : (1) sélection des espèces ; (2) définition des instructions (objets, environnement du jeu, règles) ; (3) inclusion des stress environnementaux (biotiques et abiotiques) ; (4) conception et construction des interfaces (plateau et implémentation informatique) ; (5) test avec des joueurs. L'ensemble des étapes sont interdépendantes et sont menées en parallèle pendant le développement des jeux.

\bpar{
While the board game is inspired by past experiences of player, the computer game is based on a model of simulation of the ecosystem. In order to introduce notions of equilibrium and its perturbations that occur at a larger time scale than on the board game, we propose to implement an agent-based model (ABM) and to couple its dynamics with gaming actions. ABM have already been widely used in ecology~\cite{grimm2005pattern}. Therefore, we selected a trophic chain dynamic model (extended prey-predator model) that can capture fish behavioral rules and spatially heterogeneous environment. It is particularly suitable for the game implementation: fish behaviors are influenced by players whereas the ecosystem is disturbed by external events.

Tandis que le jeu de plateau est inspiré d'experiences de joueurs, le jeu informatique se base sur un modèle de simulation de l'écosystème. De manière à introduire les notions d'équilibre et ses perturbations qui surviennent à une échelle de temps plus longue que celle du jeu de plateau, nous proposons d'implémenter un modèle basé-agent (ABM) et de coupler sa dynamique avec des actions de jeu. Les ABM sont déjà largement utilisés en écologie~\cite{grimm2005pattern}. Ainsi, nous choisissons un modèle dynamique de chaine trophique (modèle proie-prédateur étendu) qui est capable d'inclure des règles comportementales pour les poissons et un environnement spatial hétérogène. Un tel modèle est particulièrement adapté pour l'implémentation du jeu : les comportements des poissons sont influencés par les joueurs tandis que l'écosystème est perturbé par des évènements extérieurs.

\subsection{Results}{Résultats}

% Table 1 gives an overview on how the game can be introduced to a specific audience:
% ``You, little fish, just reached a new lake after an extremely intense rain event. This new area is to be conquered. But you are not the only one: three other fish species just arrived. Which player will find its territory first? Which of you will reproduce fast enough to reach a stable population and therefore remain forever and ever in the lake? Be careful! Nature is often hostile and might stay in your way. You will need to use strategy to avoid enemies; to compete for resources, to grow up and eventually you will reproduce \ldots and become the next master of water!''

\bpar{
Both games are based on the same general rules, even if slight modifications have to be expected according to the type of game. The virtual ecosystem is presented from a fish perspective. The object of the game is to reach a given number of adults and juveniles that will guarantee the stability of the population in the lake. For this purpose, each player has to find resources accordingly to his fish species. The resources are converted into “units” that can be used thereafter by the player for different purposes, such as reproduction, juvenile growth, to escape a predator or to attack a pray. The external perturbations are illustrated by “events” that are supposed to reflect abiotic (e.g. water temperature, light, water scarcity) and biotic (e.g. chemicals, parasites, fisherman) stressors. The current version of the game includes four players, each of them being a different species, namely the roach (Rutilus rutilus), the pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), the zander (Sander lucioperca), and the bleak (Alburnus alburnus). The rationale behind lies in maximizing interactions between players (predation and competition, see fig. 1) and to illustrate feeding and reproduction strategies from different perspectives (from a big solitary fish to a shoal fish, including a invasive fish species).

\subsubsection{The board game}{Jeu de plateau}


% The player is a fish, either a predator or a prey% The objective of the game is to reach a stable population of fish% Concepts illustrated: feeding strategy, reproduction, predation and competition

% Species: the roach (Rutilus rutilus) as a prey and the pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) as a predator, two common european small fish% Illustration of a native european shoal fish (the roach) and of an invasive species (the pumpkinseed) with specific life history characteristics

% The board represents the edge of a lake with plants, crustaceans, and mollusks% The player choses a fish species and starts the game with 2 token (male +female)% The players use dices to move the tokens on the board and to find ressources% Each ressource provides the fish with a given amount of energy that he accumulates% This energy can further be used to reproduce (adult fish), to grow (juvenile) or to attack a prey (predator)% Each turn, the player takes a card « chance » representing the events impacting the lake

\bpar{
The board is basically composed of boxes. Each of them represents a type of resource (e.g. crustacean, plants, insects), and some boxes are combined with an ``event'' to include the external perturbations in the game. The player has 2 token on the board (one male and one female) and is moving them by throwing dice. The ecological characteristics of each species are kept on a record paper by each player. It describes the species-specific rules (feeding preferences, time and resources needed to reproduce, how to escape/attack etc). A first prototype is currently being tested to determine and adjust the board game design, the ecological characteristics of each species and the characterization of events, in particular their impacts on players. The design of the board is under progress and will figure the edge of a lake.

\subsubsection{Computer-based game}{Jeu pour ordinateur}

% The player controls an ecosytem with preys (the roach) and predators (the pumpkinseed)
% The objective of the game is to maintain the stability of the ecosystem% Concepts illustrated: population dynamic and ecosystem resilience

%An agent-based model2 (ABM) for a simple prey-predator system isproposed as a basis of the computer game (Netlogo software)% ABM simulate the behavior and interactions between agents (fish) to reconstruct the population dynamic (bottom-up approach)% Stochasticity is included with spatialized interactions (smoothed brownian motions), illustrating the randomisation of prey-predator interactions

% model calibration :
% Systematic exploration of parameter space using OpenMole software3, to verify theoretical average trajectories in phase space, which allows analytical and numerical determination of initial position (attractor) and justify the use of this system for the game. The figures show estimated average trajectories for two points in parameter space.

% The player starts the game with a stable ecosystem: the initial position is the attractor% The button « one turn » makes the ecosystem evolve during 50 time steps% The player sees the changes in the fish populations simustaneoulsy on the screen% The trajectory can be corrected towards the attractor in the phase space by changing the parameters of the model (predator survival, prey reproduction and hunting behavior)% External events randomly perturbate the ecosystem% The game includes 5 levels of difficulty based on event strength

\bpar{
The aforementioned species and natural ressources are the basis of the system. Discrete dynamics consist in the following steps : (a) wandering of species in their prefered zone of the lake; (b) trophic interactions (fish-fish and fish-ressources) ; (c) renewing of fish (reproduction) and of ressources. The model parameters include reproduction rates, movement parameters, etc. Large-scale model exploration and calibration are currently running (Using OpenMole model exploration platform~\cite{reuillon2013openmole} to explore the NetLogo implementation which source code is openly available on the repository of the project at https://github.com/JusteRaimbault/MediationEcotox) in order to find parameter ranges at which ecosystem is in equilibrium1. The equilibrium will constitute the default state of the system without user control. User interactions are then integrated after each turn, at given time intervals (one month, when one time step is 6h for example). It allows the system to evolve in-between. During this time frame, the players observe the consequences of its actions and the reaction of the ecosystem to external events. Further developments will consist in model refinment and user latitude adjustements thanks to player feedbacks.

\subsection{Discussion}{Discussion}


%Demonstration of the proof-of-concept: the prototypes are available for testing% Both game are complementary as they integrate different time scales and illustrate diverse basic concepts of aquatic ecology% No knowledge in aquatic ecology is needed to play both games: wide possibilities in targeted audiences% The methodology is flexible and adaptable: 
% - On-going development of the games% - Refinements and changes are easy to integrate in new versions of the games

%Short term perspectives:% Next step of the project: test the games and gather player feedbacks 
%  - do players like the games?
%  - Identification of potential players (children, school/university, family, adults...) and adaptation of the games accordingly (simplication/complexification) Long term perspectives:% Potential uses of the games as educational tools (with educative support) or sensibilisation tools (e.g. adapting the species and perturbations)% Funding and diffusion of the board game through crowdfunding plateforms and game festivals% Diffusion of the computer-based game: open online access through Netlogoweb and development of mobile applications

\bpar{
A prototype of each game is currently available for testing and refinements are expected while experiencing the games. In a short term, next versions of the games will be developed after player feedback and will include the aesthetic design of the games and refined processes parameters. Mid-term and long-term objectives are oriented towards an online version of the computer game as described before, and the use of crowdfunding platforms to offer and diffuse the board game. The very first objective of our games remains to be entertaining, keeping in mind that the ludic rather than pedagogical aspects are central in the success of such game-based media. If players forget that the game is about ecology, our precise objective is reached. It would mean that the underlying scientific concepts are clearly understood.
