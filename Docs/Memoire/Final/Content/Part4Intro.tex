%\subsubsection*{Roadmap}{Feuille de Route}


%We give the following (non-exhaustive and provisory) roadmap for modeling explorations (theoretical and empirical domains being still explored conjointly) :

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item Complete the exploration of independent and weak coupled urban growth and network growth processes (all models presented in chapter~\ref{ch:modeling}), in order to know precisely involved mechanisms when they are virtually isolated, and to obtain morphogenesis scales.
%\item Go further into the exploration of toy-model of non conventional processes such as governance network growth heuristic to pave the road for a possible integration of such modules in hybrid models.
%\item Build a Marius-like generic infrastructure that implement the theory in a family of models that can be declined into diverse case studies.
%\item Launch it and adapt it on these case studies.
%\end{enumerate}

%Next steps would be too hypothetical if formulated, we propose thus to proceed iteratively in our construction of knowledge and naturally update this roadmap constantly.
