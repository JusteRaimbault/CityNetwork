% General Tips:
% 1) Make sure to edit the classicthesis-config.file
% 2) New enumeration (A., B., C., etc in small caps): \begin{aenumerate} \end{aenumerate}
% 3) For margin notes: \marginpar or \graffito{}
% 4) Do not use bold fonts in this style, it is designed around them
% 5) Use tables as in the examples
% 6) See classicthesis-preamble.sty for useful commands

% Part II : Empirical analysis / Toy-modeling
%
\ctparttext{This part provides building blocks for the final objective of constructing models of co-evolution. These contain both stylized facts from empirical analyses and toy and hybrid modeling. They correspond to three distinct components of our overall construction: first analyses at the micro-scale confirming the chaotic and non-stationary nature of interactions between networks and territories, secondly a morphogenetic vision of these that corresponds roughly to a meso-scale, and finally an application of the evolutive urban theory at the macro-scale.}

% Part - Conclusion
%
\ctparttext{A building is never used the way it was designed, that is a reality which grasping makes the difference between good and excellent architects. The effective functional use give sense to any construction. So goes it for a knowledge edifice. We shall now take a look back on what we constructed and try to take a step back. This part develops first theoretical apparels emerging from the various aspects already tackled. It then proposes to extract fundamental open questions that future research on territorial complex systems will have to tackle in the incoming decades.}
