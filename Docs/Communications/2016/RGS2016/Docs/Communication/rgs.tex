%% Abstract

%\textbf{Keywords : }\textit{Data Deluge, Computational Science, City-transportation Interactions, Spatio-temporal Correlations}

%The so-called \emph{big data revolution} resides as much in the availability of large datasets of novel and various types as in the always increasing available computational power. Although the \emph{computational shift} (\cite{arthur2015complexity}) is central for a science aware of complexity and is undeniably the basis of future modeling practices in geography as \cite{banos2013pour} points out, we argue that both \emph{data deluge} and \emph{computational potentialities} are dangerous if not framed into a proper theoretical and formal framework. The first may bias research directions towards available datasets (as e.g. numerous twitter mobility studies) with the risk to disconnect from a theoretical background, whereas the second may overshadow preliminaries analytical resolutions essential for a consistent use of simulations. We illustrate this idea with an example on well-studied geographical objects that are interactions between networks and territories. We compute static correlations between indicators of urban form and indicators of road network topology, using open datasets of european population density (\cite{eurostat}) and OpenStreetMap. A mathematical derivation of the link between spatial covariance at fixed time and dynamical covariance for spatio-temporal stochastic processes, combined with a theory of city-transportation interactions within evolutive urban systems on long times (\cite{bretagnolle:tel-00459720}), allows to infer knowledge on involved \emph{geographical processes} from empirical static correlations. In particular we show the regional nature of dynamic interactions, confirming the non-ergodicity of urban systems (\cite{pumain2012urban}). We argue that the two conditions for this result are indeed the ones endangered by incautious big-data enthusiasm, concluding that a main challenge for future Geocomputation is a wise integration of novel practices within the existing body of knowledge.

}





\sframe{Empirical Findings (Formalization)}{

$Y_i\left[\vec{x},t\right]$ spatio-temporal stochastic process, verifies empirically :

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item Local spatial autocorrelation is present and bounded by $l_{\rho}$ (in other words the processes are continuous in space) : at any $\vec{x}$ and $t$, $\left|\rho_{\norm{\Delta \vec{x}} < l_{\rho}}\left[Y_i (\vec{x}+\Delta \vec{x},t), Y_i (\vec{x},t) \right]\right| > 0$.
\medskip
\item Processes are locally parametrized : $Y_i = Y_i\left[\alpha_i\right]$, where $\alpha_i (\vec{x})$ varies with $l_{\alpha}$, with $l_{\alpha} \gg l_{\rho}$ and weakly locally stationary in space.
\medskip
%\item Spatial correlations between processes have a sense at an intermediate scale $l$ such that $l_{\alpha}\gg l \gg l_{\rho}$.
%\item Processes covariance stationarity times scale as $\sqrt{l}$.
%\item Local ergodicity is present at scale $l$ and dynamics are locally chaotic.
\item Processes are multi-scalar : since $\rho(\delta = \infty) > \rho (\delta = 0 )$, a necessary non-linear correction on processes spatial averages in correlation computation is present.
% add computation in supplementary materials / papers. -> later
\end{enumerate}
}


\sframe{Analytical Deductions}{

1. \textbf{Regimes of temporal correlations.} Let assume local ergodicity in $\vec{x}_0$ at scale $\delta \cdot l_0$ (reasonable with urban growth and network extension in recent times). The Ergodic theorem implies that $\exists \mathcal{T}$ such that

\[<Y_i (t) >_{\norm{\vec{x}-\vec{x}_0} < \delta\cdot l_0} = <Y_i (\vec{x}_0)>_{t\in \mathcal{T}}\] 

With spatial stationarity, $<Y_i>_{\vec{x}_0}=<Y_i>_{\vec{x}_1}$, thus $\mathcal{T}$ must be constant to be invariant by translation. By contraposition and (2), processes have different dynamical characteristics.
% if translate in a given direction, looses a small part, must be compensated by the area translated by delta (overlap), thus must be constant.

\bigskip

2. \textbf{Global non-ergodicity.} Let $X_k$ a partition of space into local areas. We have $<\cdot>_x = \sum_k w_k <\cdot>_{x_k} =_{(1)} \sum_k w_k <\cdot>_{\mathcal{T}_k} $. On the other hand, global ergodicity would give $<\cdot>_t = <\cdot>_{\mathcal{T}} = \sum_k w_k <\cdot>_{\mathcal{T}}$ and $\sum_k w_k \left(<\cdot>_{\mathcal{T}} - <\cdot>_{\mathcal{T}_k}\right) = 0$. Being true on each subset implies $\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}_k$, what contradicts (1).

%\begin{itemize}
%\item Assuming local ergodicity, spatial local stationarity implies and temporal local stationarity

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sframe{Case study : implications}{
% thematic conclusion of the case study on ergodicity

$\rightarrow$ Still points to explore :
\begin{itemize}
\item variable correlations areas (size and shape in space)
\item same work on cities population/train network data, which are also dynamical databases : extrapolation of ergodicity parameters ?
\item correlations of returns : link between $\rho\left[\Delta_t Y\right]$ and $\rho\left[\Delta_x Y\right]$ (more difficult : if pure local ergodicity, $\exists$ a permutation making the correspondance) % may be difficult to identify 
\item Link between $\Delta_{\delta}\rho (\delta)$ and process derivatives ?
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ We show the regional nature of network-territories interactions, in particular the non-ergodicity of urban systems on \textbf{the interaction these components}

\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ No direct results on time dynamics, but indirect : spatio-temporal processes do not have same speed and react/diffuse differently

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sframe{Discussion}{

\justify

1. \textit{Is a theory-free quantitative geography possible ?}

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ close to the trap of black-box data-mining analysis ; still poor explanatory power, can exhibit relations but not reconstruct processes


\bigskip

2. \textit{Is a pure computational quantitative geography possible ?}

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ even gaining 3 orders of magnitudes in computational power does not solve the dimensionality curse

\bigskip

\textbf{In our case study : } Without theory, would not know which objects, measures and properties to look at (e.g. multi-scale and dynamical nature of processes) ; without analytics : no conclusion from empirical analysis.


}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\sframe{Conclusion}{

\justify

$\rightarrow$ Nothing is really new, and more than ever we need simple but powerful theories {\`a}-la-Occam~\cite{batty2016theoretical}

\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Need for a wise integration of new techniques/rediscovering into existing body of knowledge : multi-modeling and model families (see Cottineau, Rey and Reuillon presentation) as one way to do that ?

\bigskip

$\rightarrow$ Interdisciplinarity (and Nexus ?!) necessary to achieve that.
