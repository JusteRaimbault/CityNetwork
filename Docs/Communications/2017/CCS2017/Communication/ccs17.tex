\sframe{Modeling Urban Morphogenesis}{

% Urban settlements and transportation networks are widely admitted to be co-evolving in the thematic and empirical studies of territorial systems. However, modeling approaches of such dynamical interactions between networks and territories are less developed. We propose to study this issue at an intermediate scale, focusing on morphological and functional properties of the territorial system in a stylized way.

\section{Methods and Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\sframe{Model : Rationale}{

% % We introduce a stochastic dynamical model of urban morphogenesis that couples the evolution of population density within grid cells with a growing road network. 

\justify

\vspace{-1cm}

$\rightarrow$ Coupled grid population distribution and vector transportation network, following the core of \cite{raimbault2014hybrid}

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ Local morphological and functional variables determine a patch-value, driving new population attribution through preferential attachment ; combined to population diffusion (aggregation-diffusion processes studied in \cite{2017arXiv170806743R})

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ Network growth is also driven by morphological, functional and local network measures, following diverse heuristics corresponding to different processes (multi-modeling)

\bigskip
\bigskip

\textit{Local variables and network properties induce feedback on both, thus a strong coupling capturing the \textbf{co-evolution}}

}



\sframe{Model : Specification}{

% With an overall fixed growth rate, new population aggregate preferentially to a potential for which parameters control the dependance to various explicative variables, namely local density, distance to the network, centrality measures within the network and generalized accessibility. A continuous diffusion of population completes the aggregation to translate repulsion processes generally due to congestion. 

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/mesocoevol}


}

\sframe{Network Generation}{


% Because of the different time scales of evolution for urban scape and networks, the network grows at fixed time steps, with rules that can be switched in a multi-modeling fashion. A fixed rule ensure connectivity of newly populated patches to the existing network.
%Two different heuristics are then compared: one based on gravity potential breakdown for which links are created if a generalized interaction potential through a new candidate link exceeds a certain times the potential within the existing network; a second one implementing biological network growth, more precisely a slime mould model. Both are complementary since the gravity model would be more typical of planned top-down network evolution, whereas the biological model will translate bottom-up processes of network growth.\justify

At fixed time steps :

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Add new nodes preferentially to new population and connect them
	\item \justify Variable heuristic for new links, among: nothing, random, gravity-based deterministic breakdown, gravity-based random breakdown (from \cite{schmitt2014modelisation}), cost-benefits (from \cite{louf2013emergence}), biological network generation (based on \cite{tero2010rules})

\sframe{Results : Calibration}{

% We obtain a full coverage of real configurations with simulation results in a principal component plan for indicators, for which most of them a close correlation structure is found. Both network heuristics are necessary for the full coverage. The model is thus able to reproduce existing urban form and networks, but also their \emph{interaction} in the sense of correlations.

\sframe{Discussion}{

\justify

\vspace{-1cm}

\textbf{Implications}

$\rightarrow$ This rather simple model reproduces most of existing urban forms in Europe for both population distribution and road network : which intrinsic dimension to the urban system and its morphological aspect ?

$\rightarrow$ Ability to reproduce static correlations and a variety of dynamical lagged correlation regimes suggests that the model captures some of the processes of co-evolution

\bigskip

\textbf{Developments}

% NOTE : not fair between heuristics, not same number of params - but open question.

% NOTE : indicators not sufficient to capture full nw topology ?

% - check best processes for a particular given configuration.

$\rightarrow$ Towards a dynamical calibration, despite the sparsity of dynamical data

$\rightarrow$ Investigate the link between spatial non-stationarity and non-ergodicity through simulation by the model

$\rightarrow$ Compare network in a ``fair'' way (correcting for additional parameters, open question for models of simulation)

}




\sframe{Conclusion}{

\justify

$\rightarrow$ A novel model of urban morphogenesis at the mesoscopic scale systematically explored : need for more coupling and comparison of models.

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ At the macro scale of the system of cities ? Need for multi-scale models.

\medskip

$\rightarrow$ With more refined urban characteristics and other dimensions ? Need for more interdisciplinarity.

\sframe{Defining co-evolution}{


\justify

No clear definition of co-evolution in the literature : \cite{bretagnolle:tel-00459720} distinguishes ``reciprocal adaptation'' where a sense of causality can clearly be identified, from co-evolutive regimes 


\bigskip
\bigskip

\cite{raimbault2017identification} identifies multiple causality regimes in a simple strongly coupled growth model $\rightarrow$ to be put in perspective with a theoretical definition of co-evolution based on the conjunction of Morphogenesis and the Evolutive Urban Theory, summarised by~\cite{raimbault2017co}

\sframe{Calibration Method}{


% The model is calibrated at the first order (indicators of urban form and network measures) and at the second order (correlations) with Eurostat population grid coupled with street network from OpenStreetMap through the following workflow: indicators (Moran index, mean distance, hierarchy, entropy for morphology, mean path length, centralities, performance for network) are computed on real areas of width 50km for all Europe (what corresponds to the typical scale of processes the model includes); parameter space of the model is explored using grid computing (with OpenMole model exploration software), from simple synthetic initial configurations (few connected punctual settlements), computing indicators on final simulated configurations;  among candidate parameters for given contiguous (in space and indicator space) real areas on which correlations can be computed, the one with the closest correlation matrix computed on repetitions is chosen.



\begin{itemize}
	\item Brute force exploration of a LHS sampling, 10 repetitions of the model for each parameter point.
	\item For each simulated point, closest in indicator space (euclidian distance for normalized indicators) among real points are selected.
	\item Among these, point with lowest distance to correlation matrix are taken.
\end{itemize}
