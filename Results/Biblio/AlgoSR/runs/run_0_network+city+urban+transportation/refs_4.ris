AB  - The Israeli Ministry of Transport initiated a project to restructure the bus network in the Metropolitan Tel Aviv, Israel, area, as part of a program to improve transit patronage. In addition to examining improvements in travel times, the project addressed ways to make the bus network easier to use. A study identified system legibility as a barrier to use. To evaluate alternative networks, a team of transportation planners developed a set of measures to evaluate the legibility of a transit network. The measures are a synthesis of common principles for city planning, transportation planning, and cognitive processes of wayfinding. These measures allow public transportation planners to evaluate the inherent legibility of various public transportation networks before the addition of navigational aids, such as maps, diagrams, signs, and others.

AB  - In the USA, there is a renewed effort towards ensuring that the design of transportation facilities enhances the cultural, social, historical, and of course, the natural environment. This shift in emphasis has been promoted in part by the ISTEA and TEA-21 acts of 1991 and 1998 and is reflected at the federal level by policy initiatives such as the recently published 'Flexibility in Highway Design from the FHWA. At the local level, an example of the new approach is seen in the increased use of traffic calming techniques as viable design solutions. "In this paper, we will evaluate the system of highway classification that is used in the USA and in Germany. Our goal is to develop guidelines concerning how the American system can be modified so that community livability issues are integrated in the overall approach to the system of highway design."

AB  - Under the United States federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, states must implement transportation system management (TSM) tactics in urban areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of using TSM tactics to improve air quality. Based on this assessment, the authors conclude that TSM measures should be effective in eliminating localized carbon monoxide problems, but that such measures are not likely to contribute significantly toward reducing regional oxidant levels. In addition, because most individual TSM tactics can have only marginal impacts on regional motor vehicle emissions, coordinating the planning and implemen- tation of a portfolio of TSM measures will be an essential element of an effective TSM program for improving air quality.

AB  - Transportation congestion is reaching intolerable levels in many urban and suburban areas in the U S. Reliance upon traditional responses, such as transit and new highway capacity, is not working -- especially in suburban areas. Although methods for dealing with suburban congestion are often different, there are a number of common features that must be considered in developing short term as well as more permanent and long lasting solutions. In proposing short term solutions, a "Menu of Actions" is described. It includes transportation actions (the traditional transit and transportation management options) where there are opportunities for getting more out of the existing systems; land use/growth management actions which will result in more rational land use-transportation interactions; financial incentives, to encourage or discourage appropriate actions; more comprehensive and systematic land use and transportation planning; and the organizational and institutional actions required to implement rational solutions. While the "Mann of Actions" provides a broad array of possible actions to provide relief in the short run, over time the growth in traffic is likely to outpace their effectiveness. Consequently, longer term and often more difficult solutions must be considered and implemented as appropriate. They could include changes in land use development and land use management policies; changes in lifestyle and business practices; improvements through technological innovation; changes in the traditional ways of providing transportation services; and greatly expanded research and development.

AB  - Traffic impact assessment (TIA) is a powerful tool for engineers and planners to determine the possible effects of a project on the transportation and traffic system. Often it is applied only to the direct impact area and countermeasures for potential negative impacts are specific for the development. This paper presents TIA as a useful tool for local governments, especially for managing traffic and in planning their respective transportation systems. Two cases involving projects that were required to undertake TIA are compared, and results are examined in relation to the sustainability of traffic management and transportation planning strategies in Metro Manila and in other cities as well. The experiences presented and discussed in this paper underline the need for the government to take an active role in promoting TIA. This will ensure that stakeholders would participate in the TIA process, leading to the careful and substantive assessment of impacts of proposed developments.

AB  - The concepts of transport mode energy consumption and road network capacity are explained in the paper, which are applied to forecast the minimum energy consumption in a Meg polis. A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

AB  - Historically, transportation planning has emphasized mobility by private vehicles. A more balanced approach, one that respects resource limits and acknowledges sustainability goals, is needed. Transportation is a means, not an end in and of itself, and must be planned accordingly. In estimating future travel demand, researchers are now using statistical models that recognize new highway improvements induce new trips. The focus is also shifting to understanding how urban activities and interpersonal relationships shape travel behavior. Planning for accessibility as a complement to mobility-based planning gives legitimacy to land-use initiatives like traditional neighborhood designs and transit-supportive developments. When concerns like livability and sustainability are weighed, transportation initiatives such as traffic-calmed streets and cooperative-based car-sharing gain wider acceptance. Evolving economic, demographic, and urbanization trends pose significant challenges to the future of transportation planning. Advanced information technologies will allow motorists to follow less congested paths. Also, they enable congestion charges to be passed on to motorists, as currently applied in Singapore. Hardware improvements, however, must be matched by supporting institutional initiatives which improve the coordination between transportation and land-use programs. Public–private partnerships, regional transportation authorities, and large-scale smart-growth are promising ways of delivering efficient and safe transportation services that promote a more livable and sustainable future.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - In determining the marginal cost of congestion, economists have traditionally relied upon directly measuring traffic congestion on network links, disregarding any "network effects," since the latter are difficult to estimate. While for simple networks the comparison of the network-based congestion costs with the link-based ones can be done within a theoretical framework, it is important to know whether such network effects in real large-scale networks are quantitatively significant. In this paper we use a strategic transportation planning model (START) to compare marginal congestion costs computed link-by-link with measures taking into account network effects. We find that while in aggregate network effects are not significant, congestion measured on a single link is a poor predictor of total congestion costs imposed by travel on that link. Also, we analyze the congestion proliferation effect on the network to see how congestion is distributed within an urban area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A framework is presented for evaluating the accessibility of urban networks to the transportation needs in urban areas. Accessibility has been defined from the point of view of the network configuration and its relationship to key factors influencing travel demand. The definition is a departure from the traditional methods of accessibility, which primarily describe the interaction of people and places. The definition in this study helps in assessing the interaction between the trip maker and the transportation network, thus helping in an evaluation of the utility of the network to trips in a study region. The methodology uses the computational capabilities of a geographic information system and relates them to the traditional urban transportation planning process. Specific indexes are presented to quantify the accessibility of the network with respect to key factors influencing trip production and attraction. The methodology presented is applicable to the analysis of accessibility of other transportation system networks and to comparisons of the accessibilities of networks of different urban areas.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Integrated Transportation Planning is a concept which suggests that a detailed package of environmental, social, economic and political tools is necessary to ensure the safe accessibility and mobility of people who wish to travel from one place to another. The notion of integrated transportation planning has steadily progressed over the years.  It began with traditional transport planning, oriented toward automobile traffic engineering, then progressed to "multi-modal planning" to include public transit modes.  It later broadened to include pedestrians, cycling, small vehicles and variable land use, and now extends furthermore to considerations of full environmental and cost impacts. Integrated transportation planning applies to rapidly urbanizing areas in growing economies and implies also that any environmental impacts should be minimized through comprehensive planning and implementation.  Integrated transportation planning includes a number of elements with the principal ones being: Enhanced Accessibility and Mobility for all, Environmental Sustainability, Participatory Planning, Transportation Demand Management, Transportation Systems Management, Comprehensive Land Use Planning, and Least Cost Optimization.  In a climate where traffic congestion, often unbearable air pollution, and ever dwindling energy supplies are becoming a major problem the world over, this paper considers blending specific elements to better achieve environmental and energy sustainability and to better serve the needs of people who wish to travel without impediment.

AB  - This paper assesses governmental performance in its investment, provision and regulation of urban transportation. Attention is given to public bus and rail transit and road transportation. Evidence based on urban transport in US cities reveals substantial allocative and technical inefficiencies that have led to large public transit deficits and severe highway congestion.I argue that it is futile to expect public officials to remedy the situation by pursuing more efficient policies such as congestion pricing and weighing costs and benefits when deciding transit service. The problem is that urban transportation policy is largely shaped by entrenched political forces that inhibit constructive change. The only realistic way to improve the system is to shield it from those influences and expose it to market forces by privatising it. This position is supported by empirical evidence based on simulations for the US and the UK's early experience with privatisation.

The implications for road planning are discussed where land use–transport integration is the core objective rather than simply traffic efficiency. If sustainable travel is to be facilitated there is a need to change both the operation of public transport and the urban structure and these changes are mutually supportive.

AB  - This research is driven by the critical need for a technological breakthrough in taxi-out prediction, and intelligence-based decision making capabilities for an airport operating system. With the advent of sophisticated automation, the use of information-driven intelligent decision support system (IIDSS) to control service operations such as airport has become a necessity to ensure efficiency and throughput. However, airlines, airports, and air traffic controller (ATC), still lack the use of intelligent systems that can assist them in delay prediction, schedule adjustments, and optimal decision making in the face of uncertainties. As per U.S. Govt. Joint Program Development Offices roadmap, new technology is needed to accurately predict delays and efficiently utilize the existing capacity to support the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). Hence, new research is needed to accurately predict taxi-out times which in turn can assist in making schedule adjustments to reduce congestions and delays, and provide a means for better utilization of ground staff of the airlines. We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation scheme for predicting taxi-out times that was tested on data from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport (DTW). Initial results show that the average prediction error for >80% of the flights are <3 min.

AB  - This report investigates ways that public transportation affects human health, and ways to incorporate these impacts into transport policy and planning decisions. This research indicates that public transit improvements and more transit oriented development can provide large but often overlooked health benefits. People who live or work in communities with high quality public transportation tend to drive significantly less and rely more on alternative modes (walking, cycling and public transit) than they would in more automobile-oriented areas. This reduces traffic crashes and pollution emissions, increases physical fitness and mental health, and provides access to medical care and healthy food. These impacts are significant in magnitude compared with other planning objectives, but are often overlooked or undervalued in conventional transport planning. Various methods can be used to quantify and monetize (measure in monetary units) these health impacts. This analysis indicates that improving public transit can be one of the most cost effective ways to achieve public health objectives, and public health improvements are among the largest benefits provided by high quality public transit and transit-oriented development.

Drawing on the literature and lessons from transportation planning practice, this paper describes the characteristics of a ” communicative” form of transportation planning and compares them with conventional practices. A communicative rationality paradigm would place language and discourse at the core of transportation planning. The paper argues that it would lead to greater attention to desired transportation ends (goals), better integration of means and ends, new forms of participation and learning, and enhanced deliberative capacity. The paper explains the implications of this paradigm for the role of the transportation planner, the purpose of planning, the planning process, communicative practices, problem framing, and the nature of planning analysis. The paper concludes with an assessment of communicative rationality's ability to promote more effective transportation planning.

Sustainable Development with Sustainable Urban Transport are key solutions to our urban environmental, social and economic problems. Sustainable Urban Transport helps to improve our environment, health, quality of life, conserves our natural resources and is inline with the basic principles of Sustainable Development to bring about order, equality and sustainability in our society at all levels, the economy and environment. This report aims to highlight various challenges to Sustainable Development and Sustainable Transportation, both internationally and South African, and sheds a light on various policies and initiatives, proposed and in implementation, to achieve sustainability and efficiency in the Urban Transport System. The development of Transport Corridors together with Sustainable Public Transport is one of the many options we can investigate to ensure an efficient and Sustainable Urban Transport System.

AB  - Benchmarking of rail firms has become a matter of substantial interest and many authors have emphasised the importance of transaction costs in regard to assessing the desirability of vertical separation. However, due to data and methodological limitations, previous rail efficiency studies have been unable to explicitly analyse the role that transaction cost measures play in determining the relative efficiency performance of different rail firms or rail systems. This paper incorporates recently produced measures of transaction costs into a two-stage bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA), applied to a sample of 43 Swedish, German and British train operating firms. In the first stage, the number of transaction staff is included as a separate (physical) input within the DEA. This is followed by a second-step Tobit regression which seeks to evaluate the impact of institutional (vertical separation and type of operation), environmental (competition) and transactional (monetary values of transaction costs) factors on technical efficiency. The results of the analysis show that transactional factors are more important in determining technical efficiency than institutional factors and the opening-up of competition.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - Drawing upon relevant literature, this article reviews research on socially sustain- able urban transportation (SSUT). Arguing that the social dimensions of sustain- ability are more often implied rather than explicit, this article subsequently considers how urban transportation influences the achievement of social sustain- ability in urban regions. Socially sustainable urban transportation is implied in the literature through the elements of social equity, social exclusion, and quality of life. Several well-established research areas provide potential theoretical, meth- odological, and applied insight into the development of future socially sustainable urban transportation research agendas, including: urban form, location- and individual-based accessibility, and city=regional planning for sustainability.

AB  - Effective management of interfaces between procurement, supply, production and distribution for higher efficiency in the supply chain is an important issue in global manufacturing, where the synchronization of production and transportation planning represents important savings in operational costs. This paper focuses on the synchronization of production planning and transportation planning in a production distribution network, where transportation is subcontracted to a professional transportation enterprise (PTE) for vehicle-hiring. Dynamic and flexible numbers of vehicles are used to cater for fast changing market demands. Thus, the number of vehicles to be hired is viewed from the planning point of view as an operational decision considered simultaneously with production and transportation planning. A mathematical model - SPTP/MTDS - for synchronized production and transportation planning under multiple times and direct shipping strategy (MTDS) is discussed, and a Lagrange relaxation decomposition-based two layer decision procedure (LRD-TLDP) is developed. By introducing artificial decision variables and Lagrange multipliers, SPTP/MTDS is decomposed into a production decision sub-problem (SPTP-PD), and a distribution decision sub-problem (SPTP-DD). A priority-based assignment heuristic and a partial chain-based genetic algorithm are developed to solve SPTP-PD and SPTP-DD, respectively. An illustration of the application of the model in an electronic appliance manufacturing enterprise in China is presented.

AB  - If we are to accommodate the rate of urban growth which North America will face in the first half of the twenty-first century, it is the contention of this paper that we must build new cities, not new towns, beyond commuting distance of existing cities. These can be located in open countryside on virgin land, or they can grow around existing small towns, all in conjunction with the construction of an innovative personal transportation system. In this paper a hexagonal modular structure, in which self-contained urban units can be combined and added to over time, is proposed as a new urban form and AVCS maglev - which will serve the new cities efficiently - is proposed as a key transportation strategy.

AB  - Several urban transportation systems are compared on the basis of the energy resources consumed in the manufacture of their vehicle and guideway systems and in their operation. Four systems, the auto, bus, rapid rail and personal rapid transit, are extensively analyzed, while the energy characteristics of dial-a-ride systems and the motorcycle are estimated. Analyses of bicycling and walking are also included for a comparison of motorized modes with human propulsion systems. For each system the energy required to manufacture a vehicle, the energy required to manufacture the guideway, and energy of operation are estimated. The average energy consumed per available seat-mile is calculated to compare the system when they are operating at capacity. An example containing assumed average occupancy levels gives a more realistic comparision on the basis of energy consumed per passenger-mile.

AB  - The greatest effects of the Federal Aid highway-oriented policy have been social, economic, and environmental. People have been displaced, neighborhoods have been changed, business patterns have been altered, the air has been polluted, and our cities even look very different—primarily as a result of building urban highways and freeways. A study of a freeway under construction in Akron, OH illustrates some of these effects of highway-oriented transportation planning. This particular freeway, although only partially finished, has had numerous social, economic, environmental effects and if finished will have many more. Some of the effects have either tended to perpetuate or aggravate already existing problems, with the result that the overall quality of life has been impacted thereby.

AB  - Cities play a vital role in promoting economic growth and prosperity. The develop- ment of cities largely depends upon their physical, social, and institutional infrastruc- ture. In this context, the importance of intraurban transportation is paramount. This article provides an overview of urban transport issues in India. Rather than covering every aspect of urban transportation, it primarily focuses on those areas that are important from a policy point of view. The article first reviews the trends of vehicular growth and availability of transport infrastructure in Indian cities. This is followed by a discussion on the nature and magnitude of urban transport problems such as congestion, pollution, and road accidents. Building on this background, the article proposes policy measures to improve urban transportation in India. Indian cities cannot afford to cater only to private cars and two-wheelers and there has to be a general recognition that policy should be designed in such a way that it reduces the need to travel by personalized modes and boosts public transport sys- tem. This requires both an increase in quantity as well as quality of public transport and effective use of demand as well as supply-side management measures. At the same time, people should be encouraged to walk and cycle and government should support investments that make cycling and walking safer.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban transportation system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops and influenced by transportation, social, economical, and environmental factors. Conventional transportation modeling approaches are unsuitable to simulate and evaluate its performance. This paper presents a system dynamics approach based on the cause-and-effect analysis and feedback loop structures. The proposed SD model comprises 7 submodels: population, economic development, number of vehicles, environmental influence, travel demand, transport supply, and traffic congestion. The model runs in Vensim PLE software using the data from Dalian, China. The coefficient of the intervention policy of vehicle ownership is chosen as the control variable for simulation, and the impacts of different policy scenarios on urban development and transportation system are analyzed. It suggests that Dalian should restrict the total number of vehicles to improve the sustainability of transportation system.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Board’s Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Board’s survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - Much of the current concern with sustainable transportation focuses on the alleged ills of the automotive industry. Global warming and a range of detrimental impacts are attributed to increased atmospheric concentrations of automotive emissions. Within Canada, various groups have attempted to achieve consensus on a variety of policies and measures intended to reduce automobile dependence. This paper is based on the premise that, from the standpoint of sustainability, the key goals for urban transportation involve first, reducing total vehicle-km of travel by altering both average trip lengths and modal split and, second, improving fuel efficiency by technological means. After examining the range of policy instruments available to achieve these goals, the highest priority policies are identified in terms of their likelihood of moving Canadian cities to more sustainable forms of land use and transportation development.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - To address climate change, many U.S. states are taking action to establish policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all economic sectors. With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided. The information in this paper provides a starting-point for transportation practitioners to use when initiating their own evaluations of greenhouse gas mitigation options at the regional, state, or local level.

AB  - An aggregative economic approach to the theory of city size is presented along with some empirical findings which suggest that even the largest cities have not yet reached excessive sizes from the point of view of growth and productivity. Urban magnitude is no simple 1 dimensional phenomenon. Modern urban centers are surrounded by very large, diffuse zonal boundaries, within which there are marked variations in the proportion of firms and people associated with that center, and in the intensity of the association. In sum, population does not constitute a conventional, countable set. In general, population will be considered as the basic magnitude and as a conventionally definable number. Most approaches to city size have emphasized the presumed diseconomy of urban scale and have sought to establish that population at which costs per capita are least, regarding this as optimal. It is argued here that both the logic and the factual basis of this approach are faulty. The argument of minimum costs is insufficient in its own terms. Such an objective is reasonable only if output per capita is constant, but it appears that output per capita is an increasing function of urban size. In that case, a more sensible objective of public policy would deal with the relation of outputs and inputs, rather than only with inputs. In every country for which evidence was found, local product per capita (or some index for it, such as income or wages) rises with urban size, and where comparable figures on cost are available, these rise far more slowly if at all. Although all of the data desirable are not available for any single country, the overall pattern is clear. Possibly the most surprising element in the data is the marked decline with increasing density in Social Overhead Captial Stocks (SOCS) per capita. This runs counter to common belief that the bigger the city the more infrastructure per capita is needed and may be the result of such effects as the greater linear quantities of roads per capita necessary in low density areas. Since it appears that the biggest cities are not too big from the perspective of economic efficiency, it may be that higher average incomes of bigger cities do not mask sharper inequalities among their citizens, so that efficiency is gained at the cost of equity. This does not appear to be the case at least for the US. On the contrary, some studies indicate that there is less poverty and a more equal distribution of incomes in big cities than in smaller cities. There are some weak indications of a downturn in the product curve at the largest urban sizes, but even should the downturn be real, this would not be inconsistent with the efficiency of those larger sizes in a hierarchical system of cities.

AB  - Urban transportation is a complex phenomenon. Since many agents are constantly interacting in parallel, it is difficult to predict the future state of a transportation system. Because of this, optimization techniques tend to give obsolete solutions, as the problem changes before it can be optimized. An alternative lies in seeking adaptive solutions. This adaptation can be achieved with self-organization. In a self-organizing transportation system, the elements of the system follow local rules to achieve a global solution. Like this, when the problem changes the system can adapt by itself to the new configuration. In this chapter, I will review recent, current, and future work on self-organizing transportation systems. Self-organizing traffic lights have proven to improve traffic flow considerably over traditional methods. In public transportation systems, simple rules are being explored to prevent the "equal headway instability" phenomenon. The methods we have used can be also applied to other urban transportation systems and their generality is discussed.

AB  - The primary objective of the research project was to develop an interactive decision tool (SNAMUTS) to assist in examining scenarios for the future growth of the Perth metropolitan area in activity centres framed around the accessibility of the transport network and the accessibility of place. The SNAMUTS tool enables the quantification of the effect of transport infrastructure improvements and modifications, and of land use intensification, on the accessibility of activity centres and corridors by different modes of transport. The SNAMUTS tool provides an in-depth examination of the potential accessibility by public transport to all centres across the metropolitan area. Accessibility is measured using an impediment variable that factors in travel time, frequency of service and transfers. In this way accessibility is measured from the perspective of a traveller who also has the choice of car travel to any location within the metropolitan area. In order to provide that choice across multiple journey purposes the inter-peak period is measured. SNAMUTS applies seven different accessibility indicators. Most measure different properties of the public transport network, including speed competitiveness with car travel; one measures the accessibility of place in terms of numbers of residents and jobs within the public transport catchment. A composite indicator for overall public transport accessibility is then compiled drawing on these indicators. A total of five future scenarios were developed to assess different assumptions for priorities in public transport service and infrastructure improvements, and (in four of these five scenarios) for the spatial distribution of urban growth in metropolitan Perth: Frequency Boost (FRB) examines the effect on network performance that can potentially be achieved in the short term by increasing service levels across the network without (or with only minor) adaptations to the physical infrastructure. Correspondingly, this scenario makes no assumptions for urban growth but is based on the same population and job numbers, and their spatial distribution, as the Status Quo scenario. The service upgrades included in the Frequency Boost scenario also form part of each subsequent scenario. • Light Rail Corridors (LRC), like the three subsequent scenarios, anticipates a growth in residents and jobs across metropolitan Perth of 42 percent to a total of 2.6 million between 2006 and 2031. It is based on accommodating all of this growth in the immediate vicinity of a network of linear activity corridors in the inner and middle suburbs anchored by a new seven-route, predominantly street-running light rail system. The focus is on corridors with existing concentrations of medium- density living and a relatively fine-grained mix of land uses. To achieve this scenario a building density roughly equivalent to R80 or a pattern of three to four- story row houses or apartments would be required, and in the CBD and some adjacent areas a building density of R160, which is generally achieved in Australian cities by mixing mid-rise (three to six-storey) development with some taller structures. Similar densities and building typologies already prevail in some of these areas. • Middle Ring Centres (MRC) selects growth nodes in the middle suburbs to accommodate all growth, and accesses these centres by a mixture of orbital rail extensions, a new two-route rapid light rail system and improvements to strategic bus corridors. Urban growth in the 19 designated activity nodes in this scenario will require an average density of 208 residents and jobs per hectare within the 800- metre radius of each centre. This is roughly equivalent to a density zoning of R160 and can be achieved by a uniform build-out of six to eight-storey apartment and office buildings, or by a mixture of low-rise (three to four storeys) and high-rise. structures. Activity nodes of such a typology and configuration can be found, for example, in Bondi Junction or Chatswood in Sydney. The Middle Ring scenario further assumes that the residential density of central Perth and central Fremantle will increase to reach a minimum density of residents and jobs of 104 per hectare. Overall however, the spatial expansion of the growth centres is quite modest on a metropolitan scale, with only 6% of the currently urbanised area affected. • Fringe Expansion (FEX) accommodates all urban growth in Greenfield areas in Perth’s outer suburbs and services these by several rail extensions and new rail routes, as well as a better connected, cross-suburban bus system. All 800-metre catchments of new train stations will be zoned and planned to accommodate about 10,000 residents and jobs each, which equates to an average density of 50 residents and jobs per hectare. Bus corridors across growth areas outside these station precincts will aim to achieve a similar density within 400 metres of the route. • Composite Wishbone (CWB) is a combination of those elements of the previous three scenarios that have the greatest positive effect on network performance. It allows for urban growth to continue simultaneously in intensification areas along new light rail corridors, designated middle-ring growth centres as well as new transit-oriented settlement areas at the urban fringe. The Composite Wishbone scenario envisions all new urban development to be public transport-oriented, including in Greenfield areas, which cater for about 20% of total growth.

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

AB  - This paper deals with the concept of an automated flexible
transportation system (AFTS) for urban mass transportation composed of
transit 'bus or van platoons that, using dedicated lanes in public
avenues common in large metropolitan areas, may improve positively the
urban transportation network, increasing passenger capacity and reducing
the vehicles' headway when compared with conventional systems. To
achieve this purpose, an automatic guidance control housed inside the
vehicles, in the absence of any driver's interference in the automated
lane sections, will be interacting with a wide range of vehicle and
ground lane sensors, communicating with the dedicated central system
computer cluster, being able to increase significantly the overall
average speed and reduce dramatically the distance between vehicles in
the platoon formation, having pre-programmed stop stations located on
central aisles. A feasibility study of the conceptual system was
performed assessing the cost-benefit ratio of the proposed system.
Finally, the paper shows some simulation results using preliminary
adaptive controller scheme, simplified platoon dynamic model and the

The challenging question is whether this choice increases the general political objective of sustainable development. In this context, also the land-use and transportation interfaces have to be envisaged. This paper aims to offer a methodological/operational contribution to sustainable mobility policy in the Naples metropolitan area (in the Campania Region, Italy). Scenario analysis is used to design combined land-use/transportation plans to be assessed from a sustainability perspective. Long-range choice options are evaluated using inter alia a sophisticated multicriteria analysis (i.e., hierarchical Regime method). Sensitivity analyses will test the robustness of policy rank order solutions found by the above multicriteria analysis.

AB  - Perhaps the most apparent transportation planning and urban development\nproblems that have over the years received attention of, and yet\ncontinue to pose challenges to policy makers, are the need to provide\nsustainable public transport system and revitalisation of distorted\nsocio-economic policies. The pressure created by rapid population growth\nof Lagos on transport infrastructure and services in the city is indeed\ngreat that decline in quality and quantity of services are inevitable\nand uncertain. The persistent trials and errors in the urban public\ntransportation policy resulted to the introduction of the three wheeler\nvehicular mode of public transportation in the metropolis of about 11\nmillion people.\nSince the vehicles hit the streets of Lagos about two years ago, many\nunder-employed graduates were put in business, many un-educated citizens\nincapacitated by poverty-stricken background got something to do, while\nshort-distanced commuters, who hitherto had made their trip on foot or\nmotorcycle had relief. These gains were, however, over shadowed by the\nrelatively small size of the vehicle (officially three passengers full\ncapacity) that made it uncomfortable for many passengers, its fragile\nnature inability to withstand the restlessness and aggressive nature of\nLagos commuters, emissions from within and other vehicles, engine noise\nfrom within and other vehicles continuously give passengers persistent\ndiscomfort. More importantly, the adoption of the mode for public\ntransport with its attendant limited occupancy restraint design put many\npassengers at risk and made the mode unsafe at any speed.\nThis paper examines the policy background of the introduction of this\nmode of public transportation in the most populated city in the African\ncontinent and discusses in details the transport-related pollution\nimplications of its use on the environment and the urban passengers and\npopulation. The overall concern of the government driven and dominant\ncontrol of public transportation systems in rapidly growing Nigerian\ncities is highlighted and the some policy suggestion advanced towards\nensuring a more effectively sustained public transport systems and urban\nenvironment.

AB  - The urban transportation planning process is buffeted by one of the paradoxes of American public opinion. The public decries urban sprawl, but craves the comfort and convenience of the auto and larger homes and lots. Typically, planners and policymakers are unwilling to confront the contradiction between what the public says and what it does. But “new urbanists” are intent on changing preferences and behavior, and they have captured the urban transportation planning process in places like Portland. Portland’s Year 2000 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for a forecast year of 2020 illustrates the tension in the urban transportation planning process of balancing accommodation of powerful decentralizing trends and the advocacy of programs to reverse those trends.

AB  - In this paper, the controllability and H∞ control method of urban transportation network are considered. Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - An urban transit system usually consists of several modes, including busses, streetcars, a subway, and light rail. Unfortunately, coordination among different modes remains a challenging problem. Difficulties arise when modifying the transit network structure on a strategic level or when synchronizing timetables on a tactical level. Traditional transit network design and timetabling intend to solve a network-optimization problem based on static origin&#x2013;destination (OD) information, with passenger assignment as a subproblem. In this paper, we propose an artificial urban transit system (AUTS) based on agent-based modeling and simulation. With AUTS, which is a special type of artificial transportation system (ATS), we are able to dynamically model the passenger's behavior and route choice and use the system to predict transit demand on a simplified transit network. The AUTS has the following important potential applications: forecasting transit flow; setting key parameters for urban transit networks&#x2014;such as service frequencies and the capacity of subway trains&#x2014;evaluating alternative modifications to subway rail and bus routes; and predicting the impact of special/emergency events to the transit network. We create a demonstration system of the Beijing transit network and present its applications in experiments.

AB  - It has been recently shown that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean network flow, density and speed exists in the urban transportation networks under some conditions. An MFD is further well defined if the network is homogeneous with links of similar properties. This collective behavior concept can also be utilized to introduce simple control strategies to improve mobility in homogeneous city centers without the need for details in individual links. However many real urban transportation networks are heterogeneous with different levels of congestion. In order to study the existence of MFD and the feasibility of simple control strategies to improve network performance in heterogeneously congested networks, this paper focuses on the clustering of transportation networks based on the spatial features of congestion during a specific time period. Insights are provided on how to extend this framework in the dynamic case. The objectives of partitioning are to obtain (i) small variance of link densities within a cluster which increases the network flow for the same average density and (ii) spatial compactness of each cluster which makes feasible the application of perimeter control strategies. Therefore, a partitioning mechanism which consists of three consecutive algorithms, is designed to minimize the variance of link densities while maintaining the spatial compactness of the clusters. Firstly, an over segmenting of the network is provided by a sophisticated algorithm (Normalized Cut). Secondly, a merging algorithm is developed based on initial segmenting and a rough partitioning of the network is obtained. Finally, a boundary adjustment algorithm is designed to further improve the quality of partitioning by decreasing the variance of link densities while keeping the spatial compactness of the clusters. In addition, both density variance and shape smoothness metrics are introduced to identify the desired number of clusters and evaluate the partitioning results. These results show that both the objectives of small variance and spatial compactness can be achieved with this partitioning mechanism. A simulation in a real urban transportation network further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in effectiveness and robustness compared with other clustering algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Traditionally transport planning and policy-making has used quanti- tative surveys to predict future demand for public transport. However, this article argues that a more participatory approach is required in order to better understand household activity patterns and the effects and implications of travel on livelihoods. Such an understanding will enable transport planning and policy to support the needs of those on low income and achieve broader poverty alleviation objectives. This article draws on case studies undertaken in Harare (Zimbabwe), Accra (Ghana) and Colombo (Sri Lanka) as part of a broader study carried out for the UK Department for International Development (DfID) Knowledge and Research Programme. The article examines the effect of public transport on certain dimensions of poverty, considers the links between urban transport and other sectors (health, education and employment) and summarizes key methods of enquiry that might be adopted in effecting a more participatory approach to transport planning.

A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - State highway departments wield a disproportionately great influence on the comprehensive planning process and on patterns of decentralization in metropolitan areas because highways are a fundamental influence on land development and because highway departments control the production of highway facilities from planning and construction to operation. Because of that influence, highway departments have been able to pursue the narrow objective of accommodating traffic despite congressional attempts to redirect transportation goals toward meeting the land-use needs of declining central cities and avoiding the adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts of highways. These adverse effects have included the isolation of central city transit-dependent minorities from suburban employment and the creation of an excessive dependence on gasoline. The inertia of this limited purpose highway program has been sustained by massive federal funding, a bureaucratically embedded and technologically intimidating planning methodology, and a system of federal plan and impact reviews whose major effect has been to expedite the approval and construction of highway projects. These deficient impact analyses and token reviews have deprived the public and elected officials of vital information about foreseeable adverse impacts and have unreasonably restricted their ability to judge highway proposals or make important decisions affecting decentralization.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - Welcome to Transportation Cost and Benefit Analysis: Techniques, Estimates and Implications, a guidebook for quantifying the full costs and benefits of different transportation modes. This 500-page+ document is a comprehensive study of transportation benefit and costing research, and a guidebook for applying this information in planning and policy analysis. This document is unique in several important ways. It is one of the most comprehensive studies of its type, including many categories of costs and benefits that are often overlooked, and the only one that is regularly expanded and updated as new information becomes available. It provides extensive reference information, mostly available through the Internet, allowing users to obtain additional information when needed. It explains economic evaluation techniques and how to apply them. It is the only study that provides costs values in a format designed to easily calculate the full costs and benefits of transportation policy and planning alternatives. Individual chapters include detailed information on various categories of transportation costs and benefits, including summaries of previous monetized estimates. Using the best available data, it provides monetized estimates of twenty costs for eleven travel modes under three travel conditions. Costs are categorized according to various attributes: whether they are internal or external, fixed or variable, market or nonmarket. Examples illustrate how this information can be applied for transportation policy and planning decisions. The Guidebook also summarizes previous transportation impact studies, describes how nonmarket impacts are estimated, discusses major findings, evaluates criticisms of transportation costing, and explores implications and applications of this research. We regularly update and revise the Guidebook. Please let us know if you have comments or suggestions for improving this information.

AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - Air pollution continues to be a serious health problem in America, and one for which our transportation system bears a large responsibility for. While the nation has undeniably achieved significant success in reducing air pollution since Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, the news isnt all positive. Recent studies have shown strong evidence linking air pollution with public health problems like asthma, cancer, and heart disease. Nearly half of all Americans - more than 130 million people - still live with unhealthy levels of air pollution.i And new findings contained in this report show that air pollution has actually gotten worse in dozens of metropolitan areas over the last decade. Federal efforts, along with federal transportation funding aimed at reducing the health risks from air pollution, have started to make a difference, but must be protected and strengthened if the nations initial progress is to be sustained. Even so, some in Congress and the Bush Administration are proposing to make drastic changes to clean air laws and programs that could severely undermine current and future progress towards cleaner air. These changes could seriously jeopardize ongoing efforts to protect public health from air pollution. This report: Provides an overview of the latest scientific evidence linking poor air quality to public health problems including asthma, cancer, and heart disease; Determines which populations and places suffer the most from air pollution in the U.S., in addition to analyzing the trends in air pollution over the last decade; Quantifies the role that transportation plays in the nations air pollution problems; and Illustrates the importance of federal laws and federal funding in particular the federal Clean Air Act and clean air money available under the federal transportation law in reducing the health-related risks from air pollution. Air Pollution and Public Health For many years, air pollution was viewed as a visual nuisance. But as the twentieth century progressed, our understanding of air pollution evolved considerably. As a result of several highly publicized air pollution events, including the Donora, Pennsylvania fog, where 17 people died and nearly half the towns 14,000 residents became sick from a severe air pollution episode in 1948, researchers began to acknowledge that air pollution was also a significant threat to public health.ii Congress responded in 1970 by passing the Clean Air Act. In 1990, they approved a significant set of strengthening amendments to the Clean Air Act aimed specifically at reducing air pollution from cars and heavy duty vehicles since it was increasingly evident that underestimating transportation as a major source of air pollution had been a significant factor in the failure of many air pollution control plans. In February 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court also upheld the right of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to use health-based air quality standards. Recent medical research has linked air pollution to a host of public health concerns including asthma, cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure, birth defects, and even brain damage.iii Air pollution has been found to shorten life expectancy, and not just for sensitive populations such as those with asthma, but for the general population as well. New research and studies documented in this report also show that: Asthma rates are growing significantly in the U.S. population, increasing 59 percent from 1982 through 1996 (see the Appendix, on page 55, for the percentage of adults with a lifetime prevalence of asthma by metropolitan area); Transportation-related air pollution, specifically ground-level ozone and particulate matter (PM) from cars and heavy duty vehicles, has been found to severely exacerbate asthma in both adults and children; Exposure to air pollution in the form of ozone and particulate matter increases the risk of heart disease; Living in neighborhoods with proximity to higher traffic volumes has been linked to increased cancer risk; and, Large segments of the U.S. population, in particular minorities, children, and the elderly, are especially vulnerable to the health effects of air pollution. Places with the Worst Air Pollution Where you live makes a tremendous amount of difference in how much air pollution youre typically exposed to. In terms of regional air pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) produces a daily Air Quality Index that tracks air pollution levels for five primary pollutants and has become a standard part of weather forecasting throughout the U.S. Every year, the EPA publishes an annual survey detailing how many times each regions Air Quality Index exceeds a score of 100, the standard for generally unhealthy air which is often translated into a Code Orange day or worse (Code Orange days indicate that air quality is unhealthy for children, older adults, and people with respiratory disease). The chart below shows the ten regions with the highest total number of days exceeding a score of 100 for generally unhealthy air over the last three years (for a listing of the fifty metropolitan areas with the highest number of days of unhealthy air quality, see Table 1, on page 26 in the full report). Recent Trends in Air Pollution Air quality has improved significantly since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1970. Yet almost half of all Americans over 130 million people still live in areas that violate federal health standards for air pollution,iv and we now understand that even modest amounts of air pollution at levels lower than current federal health standards can have significant and detrimental impacts on public health.v In some larger metro areas, air pollution routinely reaches unhealthy levels nearly twice a week, and in 52 larger metropolitan areas (for which data was available), air quality was unhealthy at least once a month during the period 2000 to 2002. In short, while significant progress has been made in reducing air pollution nationwide, many regions and millions of people still live with poor air quality that poses a significant threat to public health. STPPs own analysis of the last ten years of air quality data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shows that the number of days of unhealthy ozone pollution (or smog) levels nationally has held just about steady over the last decade (ozone is the only air pollutant of the six major pollutants that the U.S. EPA has collected data for in a consistent manner over the last decade, allowing for comparisons over time). Some metropolitan areas have shown significant improvements in ozone pollution, and nowhere have these changes been more dramatic than in California. While several regions in California Los Angeles in particular still have some of the worst air pollution problems in the country, they have also made some of the most significant gains using a combination of air pollution reduction strategies in addition to relying on a strong regional planning agency (known in southern California as the South Coast Air Quality Management District) dedicated exclusively to fighting air pollution. But in 30 larger metropolitan areas, in 20 states, the number of days of unhealthy ozone has increased over the past decade (see Table 2, on page 28). In all but three of these places, both the number of days of unhealthy levels of air pollution, and the population have grown. In other words, not only is air pollution getting worse in these areas, but more people are breathing it. The table on the next page shows the ten metro areas with the highest growth in the number of days of unhealthy ozone levels. Transportation Is a Major Contributor to Air Pollution Cars, buses and trucks are a major source of pollutants that can significantly degrade air quality. Transportation is responsible for more than 50 percent of carbon monoxide, about 34 percent of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, and more than 29 percent of hydrocarbon emissions (which combine with NOx in sunlight to form ozone or smog). Transportation (on-road sources only) also accounts for as much as 10 percent of fine particulate matter emissions.vi The chart below ranks the ten major metropolitan areas in the U.S. with the highest percentage of air pollution from transportation sources (see Table 3, on page 31 in the full report for a ranking of major metropolitan areas). New emissions standards, routine vehicle inspections, and clean technologies established and implemented by the Clean Air Act have had great success in cutting vehicle emissions per mile driven. Its estimated that emissions of criteria pollutants per mile driven have fallen by more than 90 percent since 1970.vii But at the same time, the number of miles driven, and the number of trips made by cars and trucks has skyrocketed, growing 162 percent and 57 percent, respectively, since 1969.viii Should this pace continue, the growth in driving will substantially undermine much of the emissions reductions made possible by technology improvements from cleaner cars and more efficient engines. Transportation-related air pollution impacts not only public health, but also exacts a huge price tag in terms of economic costs. Depending on how you value a life, the public health costs of pollution from cars and heavy duty vehicles have been estimated between $40 billion and $64 billion per year. The bulk of these public health costs are attributable to premature death, accounting for 77 percent of costs. The remainder is attributable to non-fatal illnesses.ix STPP has calculated specific public health costs from transportation-related air pollution for every major urban area in the U.S., the results of which can be found in Table 4, on page 36 in the full report.

This paper presents data on parking and trip generation rates to illustrate the misuse of precise numbers to report statistically insignificant estimates. Beyond the problem of statistical insignificance, parking and trip generation rates typically report the parking demand and vehicle trips observed at suburban sites with ample free parking and no public transit. When decisionmakers use these parking and trip generation rates for city plan- ning, they create a city where everyone drives to their destinations and parks free when they get there.

Thus a prima- ry objective of an urban transit system should be to provide a flexible and balanced set of options to the workers in the metropolitan area for their journey to work. This paper discusses various facets of an appropriate balance among the three modes: rapid rail, bus, and automobile. Three cities are selected for further analysis: Baltimore, Kansas City, and Phoenix. These cities represent different stages in economic-transportation develop- ment, and also present different spatial patterns of residence and employment. The appli- cability of rapid rail transit to each city is examined in view of central city worker con- centration and recent trends.

AB  - It has been shown recently that a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) exists in urban transportation networks under certain conditions. However, MFD is not universally expected. Previous research demonstrates the existence of MFDs in homogeneous networks with similar link densities. More recent work focuses on the partitioning of a heterogeneous transportation network based on different congestion levels. A desired partitioning produces homogeneous regions with similar link densities to guarantee a well-defined MFD and spatially compact shapes to ease the implementation of control measurements [1]. Based on recently proposed partitioning mechanism, this paper further explores the spatial characteristics of sub-networks (sub-regions or clusters) in urban transportation networks. In this paper, a metric is defined to evaluate the spatial compactness of each cluster in the network. In order to obtain the metric, a fast graph traversal algorithm is proposed, which can produce a clockwise sequence for the spatially coordinated boundary nodes along a network. The algorithm takes O(n) and the effectiveness is proved and validated. By applying the boundary smoothness metric to our previous clustering results, we show that the spatial compactness is appropriately guaranteed for each region and the future control policies can therefore be easily implemented based on the partitioning and MFDs. The proposed algorithms can have more general applications in fields of network and graph theory.

AB  - Transportation decisions clearly affect land-use patterns, and land-use decisions clearly affect transportation systems. Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle.

AB  - The development of the Munich Rapid Transit System, coupled with the growth of the Munich region, has had a major effect on the spatial structure of the region. The radial form of the rapid transit system has led to an outward movement of higher in- come families and a strengthening of the service function of the city centre, to the cost of local centres. Lower income families are tending to settle in the city centre fringe areas, although their primary employment opportunities, in manufacturing industry, are in- creasingly moving to the urban fringe. There is, thus, a growing spatial separation between homes and workplaces and although the rapid transit system has reduced traffic congestion in Munich, it has encouraged the development of an urban structure which is not com- patible with the objectives of either the state or the region.

AB  - BID12081.WRI (34) This paper proposes the fuzzy multicriteria ranking method to conduct the evaluation of urban transportation investment alternatives. Since urban transportation investment is a public investment problem, which requires that various aspects of impacts upon different interest groups be considered, it is therefore regarded as a multicriteria decision making and group decision making problem. In view of future uncertainties, since investment alternatives cannot be cleared in terms of numerical values under the anticipated achievement values of each criterion, it is then considered to be within the range of fuzziness. To make it easier to put the application to practical use, this paper has used triangular fuzzy numbers to spell out the possible range of the anticipated achievement values, whereas the principle of majority rule is used to establish weights and the anticipated achievement values of the triangular fuzzy numbers. From fuzzy weights and fuzzy achievement values, the fuzzy synthetic achievement values of investment alternatives can then be derived. This paper has further revised the Kim-Park method so as to perform the superiority and inferiority comparisons among the fuzzy synthetic achievement values, in the hope that the degree of optimism and pessimism of most of the experts in the decision making group can be demonstrated without each expert stating his/her preferences. An example is used to exemplify the method being presented.

AB  - An analysis of data of the past few decades from cities around the world indicates that history is repeating itself. Although there are significant differences in socioeconomic and technological characteristics among these cities, a remarkable similarity exists in trends in urban transportation. The current growth in the use of automobiles in many cities of developing countries follows similar trends experienced in the United States and other developed countries several decades earlier. Even though there is much awareness and knowledge about sustainability, private vehicle ownership, and use continue to grow at an increasing pace with rising personal incomes and desires to experience faster and more reliable transportation technology. Urban density, expressed in number of people and/or jobs per unit of land, is the key indicator of the level of automobile ownership and use, and of associated parameters of sustainability. As personal incomes rise, choice of residential and job location increases, causing a decrease in urban density and affecting the relative use of private transportation and public transit. There are policy options related to land use, pricing, and technological factors that can have far reaching influence on the long-term sustainability of urban-transportation systems around the world. The basic implication of the analysis is that urban-transportation sustainability can be greatly enhanced if there are profound changes in urban structures and activities that can slow or reverse the growth in the use of private automobiles and can make transit and other modes attractive and viable.

AB  - In this study, link vulnerability index was derived based on a given set of traffic condition and availability of alternate paths when a road link was damaged. The identification results were considered as the basis of traffic assignment. With the purpose of decreasing the system disruption risks, a modified System Optimal (SO) traffic assignment model was presented. The evacuation situations under the conditions of classical and modified SO traffic assignment modes were simulated and compared. The results showed that although the modified traffic assignment mode could lead to an increase in the evacuation network clearance time and average travel time, it could make the system disruption risk decrease about 20%, and the results also provided a useful reference for the urban emergency planning department when making emergency routing strategies. 2011 ASCE.

AB  - This paper traces the development of urban transportation planning in the United States, focusing particularly on the influence that three previous conferences - Sagamore (1958), Hershey (1962), and Williamsburg (1965) - have had on the course of this development. Included also are comments on the current state of the art of urban transportation planning and observations as to its future direction. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1934, which authorized the use of "1 Y2 percent funds" for highway planning is identified as the progenitor of urban transportation planning in the U.S., and two reports based on information developed by the highway planning surveys first funded under the 1934 Act, "Toll Roads and Free Roads" (I 939) and "Interregional Highways" (1944), are credited with preparing the ground for much of the urban transportation planning that was to follow. The rapid development of home interview survey techniques in the late 1940's and the full-scale introduction of computer technology in the Detroit Area Transporta- tion Study are noted, as is the work of the National Committee on Urban Transporta- tion, which was initiated in 1954 under sponsorship of the Automotive Safety Foundation. In addition to its substantial technical contributions, the NCUT, through its success in mobilizing the cooperative efforts of virtually every major group concerned with urban transportation, stimulated significant gains in Federal-State-local relationships and paved the way for increased Federal aid to cities in solving their local transportation problems.The impact of the 1956 and 1962 Federal-Aid Highway Acts on urban transpor- tation planning is assessed. The substantial contributions, of the Hartford, Sagamore, Hershey, and Williamsburg conferences are discussed, as are their shortcomings. It is noted that many of our present concerns - environmental impacts, relationships between transportation and land use, need for cooperation among all levels of government, the multi-modal nature of urban transportation, and the need for citizen involvement, to name a few - were incorporated in the provisions of either one or another of the Federal-Aid statutes in the 1950's and '60's or appear in the recommen- dations of the several conferences. That these matters still concern us today is given as evidence that planning has not fully lived up to its promise and responsibility, that more rather than less planning is needed, and that, above all, new leadership to pick up where the old has left off must soon assert itself.

AB  - North American cities have been evolving from monocentric to polycentric metropolitan regions, with multiple concentrations of activities occurring outside of traditional urban cores. This new urban structure, with multiple urban "activity centers," has profound influence on the functioning of cities, particularly transportation systems. This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incorporates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed methodology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria. The impact of these "transportation activity centers" on Philadelphia's travel patterns is explored.

AB  - This paper develops recommendations for improving in an evolutionary manner the performance of our urban ground transportation systems. The strengths and limitations of present static control technology and current computer traffic signal and freeway surveillance and control systems in urban areas are described. A taxonomy of possible information and control configurations in urban traffic operations is developed. The alternatives in the taxonomy are analysed and used as the basis for recommending specific real time information and control functions for improving, in an evolutionary manner, the performance of urban ground transportation systems. The recommended improvements would allow for the first time a meaningful substitution of operational control for physical (static) capacity increases in urban transportation.

AB  - The majority of comparisons between state transportation systems do not control for characteristics that may vary greatly between states (e.g., vehicle miles traveled). A shortcoming of such analyses is that a state's individual characteristics can be highly influential in determining how transportation policy is set and funds are spent. The purpose of this paper is to extend previous efforts to create groups of similar peer states by developing a new methodological framework that incorporates demographic, temporal, and locational variability into the peer group delineations. We collected historical data for 42 variables on transportation infrastructure, population, economy, growth, topography and weather. To examine trends before and after the passage of ISTEA we gathered data over two time periods: 1985 through 1990 and 1995 through 2000. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we reduced variables into seven components, and then statistically clustered states into peer groups for each time period based on the components and the remaining variables. We identified a range of cluster solutions and demonstrate how cluster statistics help to describe the contextual basis behind the peer grouping. The results of this study are to provide government agencies, researchers and the public with a systematic methodological framework for identifying peer states that reflect similar attributes contributing to the development and maintenance of state transportation systems.

AB  - This volume, an executive summary of the Enhanced Night Visibility project, is the first of 18 volumes that report on the project’s evaluation of the merit of implementing supplemental ultraviolet headlamps, supplemental infrared systems, and other vision enhancement systems (VESs) to enhance drivers’ nighttime roadway safety. The entire project evaluated 18 VESs in terms of their ability to provide object detection and recognition. Objects included scenarios with pedestrians standing or walking in different locations on the roadway. Pedestrians were dressed in black, white, or blue clothing to produce varying levels of contrast with their surroundings. Detection and recognition testing took place in clear weather, rain, snow, and fog conditions. Project research also evaluated a subset of the VESs for their effect on drivers’ disability and discomfort glare. The VESs were also tested for their value in facilitating drivers’ detection of pavement markings and other traffic control devices. The results indicated that supplemental ultraviolet headlamps do not provide sufficient benefit to justify further testing; however, supplemental infrared vision enhancement systems do offer an improvement over headlamps alone for detection of pedestrians. Near infrared systems have the potential to provide an added benefit in detecting pedestrians in inclement weather, but the implementation of NIR technology is the key to achieving this benefit.

AB  - A combined transportation-land use model is proposed in this paper. Unlike other existing urban land use and transportation planning models in which a â€œfixed demandâ€  for services is assumed to be known at the zonal level of an urban area, zonal travel demand is endogenously determined together with link congestion costs, optimal amounts of production and resulting efficient densities of land uses, once the transportation network is given. Some characteristics of alternative solutions are demonstrated. The proposed model represents progress over previous efforts in combining land use-transportation problems since the travel choice as to origin, destination and routes as well as amounts of goods to be produced at the optimal density of land uses are integrated into a consistent mathematical programming framework.

AB  - This paper serves as an introduction to this special issue on new developments in urban transportation planning. The papers in this issue highlight how physical mobility is still an essential priority for urban life, but that there are associated costs in the terms of environmental impacts, quality of life and economic performance of cities. Four features of the emerging urban transportation field are identified. The first defining feature is that it is a discipline in the midst of a paradigmatic transition. Second is its overarching aim of achieving sustainable urban mobility as part of a broader effort towards enhancing quality of life in cities. The third feature is the emphasis on collaboration, integration and exchange with other professions and policy sectors. The last distinctive feature is the recognition that urban transportation planning is a communication-oriented activity.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new\nand redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is\nconcerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway)\nnetwork users. This paper presents a hi-level optimization model-in\nwhich the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first\ntime-for solving the public transportation network redesign problem\n(PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total\ncost, including user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost,\nfor the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource-\nand policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user\nself-routing optimization problem in which all transit users try to find\nthe transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number\nof transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic\nalgorithm-based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP hi-level\noptimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical\nresults are described. Future research directions are also given.

AB  - This paper describes the characteristics of transportation demand management. The origin of transportation demand management (TDM) as it has evolved in the US is related to federal policy initiatives that first focused on improving the efficiency of the urban transportation system through operational improvements, and then incorporated concerns such as air quality and energy conservation into the transportation planning process. The paper then examines the effectiveness of TDM actions and concludes that those actions most likely to increase the 'price' of travel for single occupant vehicle use will be most effective. The paper identifies several strategies for improving the effectiveness of TDM actions in the context of regional transportation planning, including: incorporating TDM as part of the solutions for regional transportation planning, linking TDM to land use decisions, making the costs of travel more apparent to the user, and making TDM implementation more palatable to the general public.

AB  - To meet the requirement of real-time vehicle navigation, a new path planning algorithm based on partitioned urban transportation network is proposed in this paper. The foundation of the algorithm is that an actual road network has its particular spatial distribution features, and GIS has strong visual editing functions for transportation network. According to the size of the transportation network, with the GIS platform SuperMap, we partition the network into a certain amount of rectangular blocks, and then according to the starting node and the destination node, the searching area of the algorithm is restricted reasonably. With the actual example given, the experimental results prove the high operational efficiency and strong practicality of the new algorithm.

AB  - This paper shows that robustness analysis is a technique with a potential for aiding decision makers in choosing transportation investment projects. In this paper, it has been demonstrated that it can be successfully used in urban transportation planning in conjunction with urban travel demand software. The robustness analysis procedure emphasizes the need, under conditions of uncertainty, to make early decisions in a time-phased sequence, while preserving future options that currently seem attractive. The results of the robustness analysis from the case study used in this paper indicate that the method is simple to understand, easy to use, minimizes future surprises in terms of expected future events not happening, and provides the flexibility required in typical urban planning problems where decision making is needed to be taken under conditions of uncertainty. A general framework to be used in such cases is proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Managing large, complex urban transportation systems involves numerous stakeholders because of decentralized ownership and operation of distinct pieces of the physical network and services. To deliver better service to users, many urban regions are adopting technological and operational solutions, both of which necessitate interaction among the decentralized organizations. This research applies systems engineering analysis techniques—design structure matrix and clustering—to improve efficiency and effectiveness of organizational interactions between agencies as they deploy intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and attempt to integrate their operations. Specifically, this paper examines the application of clustering to the institutional structure set forth by the regional ITS architecture for metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Clustering of Seattle area organizations noted previously unidentified multilateral relationships that offer potential for more efficient interagency interactions and, ultimately by extension, delivery of more effective transportation services to users

AB  - An interdisciplinary research program of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, has investigated the potential impact of substituting telecommunications and computer technology for certain forms of urban transportation [1]. Emphasis has been placed upon the use of these technologies to alleviate the massive twice-daily peak commuting loads imposed upon most major American cities. The primary means by which these technologies will be used is to allow "information industry" workers to perform their jobs at work centers scattered throughout each city, close to their homes, rather than commuting long distances to work. A basic premise is made that this reorientation of urban work patterns will not occur unless the technological substitutes can be shown to be both economical and effective. The results of a study of a major insurance firm located in the Los Angeles central business district are presented. The study evaluated the present transportation patterns, population distribution, and business contact requirements of a major administrative division of this firm. These commuting and communicating patterns were then used as the basis for assessing the feasibility of the use of various levels of telecommunications and computer technology for allowing the substitution for commuting by "telecommuting." Alternative telecommuting network designs were formulated and evaluated with respect to their ability to facilitate current work functions. Costs of network installation and operation were compared with the present costs of commuting. It is concluded that present communications and computer technology, in terms of "off-the-shelf" hardware and services, can offer an economical substitute for commuting.

The definition of SUFT makes a categorisation of actions possible which enables actors to select effective strategies towards SUFT. The indicator set consists of two levels: impact indicators which describe how the urban freight transport violates the principles of sustainability; and performance indicators which describe different categories determining the characteristics and performance of the urban transport system. A literature study analyses the characteristics determining the performance of actors in the urban freight transport chain. Knowing the current state and improvement potential of the urban freight transport system are prerequisites for defining successful strategies and implementing effective actions.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  - Public housing is that housing which is owned and managed by public authorities. Its main role is to supply housing to unprivileged people. Public housing can be found in both capitalist and socialist countries, developed and developing countries. However, different countries have different public housing policies. Different policies have different effects in realizing government's housing objectives. America and China are two influential but different countries in the world. American is the biggest developed capitalist country and China is the biggest developing socialist country. America and China established public housing system in the 1930s and 1950s respectively. Both public housing systems have made significant progress but they also produced some problems after entering into the 1990s. This paper aims at making a comparative analysis of public housing policies in China and America, based on the experiences of Louisville and Jinan.

AB  - Dean’s Words Mohinder Singh Dean LTA Academy 2 012 has continued to see sustained effort in urban transport research, planning and development all over the world. We see evidence of this in the contributions to this issue of JOURNEYS, and even during some of the presentations made at the 3rd World Cities Summit held in Singapore in July this year. A highlight of the four day biennial event was the Flagship Urban Solutions Track (FUST) series of discussions which also explored the successes and challenges of various urban transport solutions. We are pleased to feature excerpts from one of those discussions, namely, Mobile Cities – In Search of New Urban Mobility Systems, here. Also, Dr Carlos Dora and Jamie Hosking, collaborating under the auspices of the World Health Organization, present an insightful review on the various ways urban transport directly and indirectly affects our overall health. Their findings are not confined to just physical health, but also examine other areas that have an impact on our well-being, including access to employment, education and recreation. From the portals of Demographia, a public policy firm in St Louis, USA, Wendell Cox questions the long-held and popular belief that lower density cities have longer average work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion compared to more compact cities. He puts forward several key evidence, arguments and analyses to show that the opposite is true – that higher urban densities are associated with longer work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion. London’s splendid showing during the 2012 Olympics is largely underscored by a well- planned public transportation strategy that ensured everyone arrived everywhere on time, with minimal disruption to the city’s daily business routine. The strategy leveraged on a Travel Demand Management programme christened Travel Advice for Business (TAB). Chris Hanley of Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was part of the team that delivered the TAB programme and shares exactly how it was done with a detailed account in this volume. Dr Wong Yiik Diew and Koh Puay Ping at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University provide a detailed examination of cycling mores in Singapore. They trace its evolution from an initially popular transport mode which was later relegated to being ‘the poor man’s transport’ and its current re-emergence as green transportation in an energy and environment conscious age. They also present the findings of a survey that revealed the preferences and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians affected by them. The survey findings could be useful in directing and determining the future of cycling culture in Singapore. The Land Transport Authority’s Mageret Ely and AECOM’s Elaine Brick continue the discussion on the topic of cycling in the final article, but from a more global perspective. Focusing on the growing popularity and success of bike-sharing schemes in three cities, namely, Paris, New York and Copenhagen, they outline how strategic policy, network planning, education and awareness contribute to the growth of such programmes. The various authors for this volume have generously given their time and talent to help improve our understanding of so many areas in urban transportation development and planning, and helped us to have a new outlook to old issues. They have provided invaluable insight and simultaneously demonstrated how we can never assume that convention cannot be challenged and ingenious solutions are inconceivable. For that, I most surely thank them and trust you will find this volume an enjoyable read. Before signing off, I would like to give you a sneak peek at what JOURNEYS 2013 will hold. We shall be producing one bumper volume in 2013, as a commemorative issue for the upcoming inaugural LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) 2013.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - In this paper we propose a dynamic Stackelberg game-theoretic model for urban freight transportation planning which is able to characterize the interaction between freight and personal transportation in an urban area. The problem is formulated as a bi-level dynamic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) which belongs to a class of computationally challenging problems. The lower level is dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) with inhommogeneous traffic that characterizes traffic system optimum (SO) freight transportation planning problem which aims at minimizing the total cost to a truck company. A mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) reformulation is derived and a projected gradient algorithm is designed to solve this computationally challenging problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to show that when planning freight transportation the background traffic is nonnegligible, even though the amount of trucks compared to other vehicles traveling on the same network is relatively small. What's more, in our proposed bi-level model for urban freight transportation planning, we find a dynamic case of a Braess-like Paradox which can provide managerial insights to a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) in increasing social welfare by restricting freight movement.

AB  - In current practice, very few Metropolitan Planning Agencies attempt to capture the effects of transportation system changes on land use, and the consequent feedback effects on transportation system performance, despite substantial evidence that these effects may be significant. In this paper, we present a case study on the application of UrbanSim, a detailed land use simulation model system, and its integration with a regional travel demand model in the Greater Wasatch Front area of Utah. Like several other metropolitan areas, this region has recently been confronted with legal challenges to proposed highway projects, drawing substantial scrutiny to the land use-transportation connection. We describe the UrbanSim model specification, results from model estimation, and sensitivity analyses conducted with the combined land use and travel model system. The results of the sensitivity analysis suggest that accounting for the land use effects of a regional transportation plan may produce significant shifts in key transportation evaluation measures such as vehicle miles traveled, vehicle hours traveled, and hours of congestion delay. ?? 2006.

AB  - Travel demand management (TDM) has been included in many transportation plans over the past three decades to address key policy objectives, including energy conservation, environmental protection, and congestion reduction. Acknowledging that most of what planners do to operate the transportation system today is managing demand goes a long way toward understanding the need to better integrate TDM into the transportation planning process. Likewise, TDM is sometimes overlooked as a solution strategy because of skepticism over actual impacts, and difficulties with measuring results. To address this gap in current transportation planning practices and the growing role of demand management, FHWA has developed a desk reference titled Integrating Demand Management into the Transportation Planning Process. This article highlights the key content of that guidance and provides some insight into its use and utility. The desk reference will encourage transportation planners to take a more measured and thoughtful approach to integrating TDM into the planning process.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

No single model can cover the range of spatial and temporal scales and processes involved. This leads to a multi-tiered approach and a cascade of models to describe alternative urban development and transportation scenarios and their multicriteria assessment and comparative analysis. This paper describes the methodology and application examples of Sustainable Urban Transportation (SUTRA) (http://www.ess.co.at/SUTRA/) a City of Tomorrow project under the European Union Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Research Programme. The primary objective of SUTRA was to develop a consistent and comprehensive model-based approach.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - The nation has compelling reasons to reduce its consumption of oil and emissions of carbon dioxide. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) promise to contribute to both goals by allowing some miles to be driven on electricity drawn from the grid, with an internal combustion engine that kicks in when the batteries are discharged. However, while battery technology has made great strides in recent years, batteries are still very expensive. Transitions to Alternative Transportation Technologies-Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles builds on a 2008 National Research Council report on hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The present volume reviews the current and projected technology status of PHEVs; considers the factors that will affect how rapidly PHEVs could enter the marketplace, including the interface with the electric transmission and distribution system; determines a maximum practical penetration rate for PHEVs consistent with the time frame and factors considered in the 2008 Hydrogen report; and incorporates PHEVs into the models used in the hydrogen study to estimate the costs and impacts on petroleum consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore an important and unique role which community participation and involvement can play in a revised transportation plan- ning process. A review of diverse views about community participation, as well as a critique of the current urban transportation planning process, reveals that the former has played, primarily, ad hoc opportunistic and diverse roles, and that the latter is in desperate need for dynamic, subjective, "impact" information - required to assess attractive transportation systems. The contributions of several disciplines - eco- nomics, operations research, management science, political science, public administra- tion, and others - are reviewed to assist in the development of a conceptual frame- work for a new community participation role, as a provider of key information to the planning process. An eclectic, experimental approach is recommended to explore the possibilities further.

AB  - Network location models have been used extensively for siting public and private facilities. In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions. We conclude by identifying promising research directions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model-a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.

AB  - The network approach to urban studies can be differentiated from other approaches by its emphasis on the primacy of structures of interpersonal linkages, rather than on the classification of social units according to their individual characteristics. Network analysis is also a methodology for the investigation of these structures. Substantive issues related to interpersonal ties in the city, migration, resource allocation, neighborhood, and community are examined in terms of the network structures and processes that order and integrate urban activities. Finally, a view of the city itself as a network of networks is proposed. It is the organization of urban life by networks that makes the scale and diversity of the city a source of strength rather than of chaos, while it is precisely that scale and diversity which makes the existence of a complex and widely ramified network structure possible.

The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model.

AB  - By all appearances, the circumstances surrounding employment and income distribution in the United States have remained notably the same over the past 30–40 years. At the same time, policies for improving the conditions of low-income persons have remained relatively unchanged. Relevant published accounts continue to cite poorly integrated residential and employment location patterns and poor public transportation service as critical obstacles to improving the economic and social conditions of low-income persons. The relationship between poverty and public transportation was researched extensively during the late 1960s and the early 1970s; however, little recognition has been given to these efforts by more recent research efforts. To learn from the past we should review public transportation policies from 1960 to 2000 to highlight federal policies that affected urban areas during this time period, especially in relation to low-income transportation mobility.

AB  - This paper asserts the continuing need for a long-range component to urban tran- sportation planning, citing particularly the relationships between short- and long-range planning and the dangers of a single-minded concentration on short-range planning. However, the nature of the long-range planning procedure that is required is substan- tively different from that of most extant approaches. Some of the specific requirements and capabilities of a new procedure are described, and existing procedures are compared against these. In the latter part of the paper, some of the elements of a new long-range planning procedure are characterized. It is suggested that the procedure be built around a scenario approach to confronting and bounding future uncertainty. Second, the need to incor- porate financial forecasting in the process is laid out and related to the scenario concept. Third, the need for travel- and impact-forecasting procedures is recognized and a set of input, output and operating requirements for such procedures are specified. It is sug- gested that improved sketch-planning tools may fit the requirements to a large extent. It is also suggested that some procedures or models in the process should be "synthetic" models, not needing calibration for each new application. Finally, a number of require- ments are specified for the display and evaluation of planning proposals from this pro- cedure. A major emphasis is placed here on transparency of the process and respon- siveness to direct intervention by the decision-maker.

AB  - The 1970s have been characterized by a growing sense of environmental, energy, and public revenue limits and by a continuing sharp decline in the national birth rate. Within the framework of these changing public concerns and priorities, debate on urban transportation policy has also shifted focus. There is less concern with large-scale highway and transit projects, and more with improved management and utilization of existing facilities. Further, the current acute sense of resource scarcity has increased interest in alternative means to allocate limited transportation funds to increase mobility as well as reduce dependence on imported oil, minimize pollution, aid job development, and increase the options of the elderly and the handicapped. The American political system has vitally important characteristics of a â€³conservativeâ€³ nature, but it is also highly attuned to dealing with the radical nature of modern reality. In reconciling these two orientations, American politicians are drawn inexorably to technological innovation as a path to problem-solving with minimal disruption of existing social arrangements and behavior patterns. Where technology is unable to do the job, the system often appears woefully ineffective. In dealing with at least some of the major problems of urban transportation, however, the system appears to be within a decade of achieving an unambiguous triumph.

There are other positive features that could be used to enhance analyses and to prepare information in support of decision-making. These include: visualization of analysis results, improved communication with decision-makers, new analytical tools for testing transport technology innovations and investigating travel behaviour. This paper reports the methodological framework that is required for analysing the emission implications of measures that are intended to reduce vehicle emissions in urban transportation. A case study of the National Capital Region (NCR) Canada is used for illustration purposes. The overall framework for urban transportation planning, including emissions estimation, is introduced. The role of GIS is highlighted in terms of enhancing the reliability of data. Methodologies are noted that serve as an interface between travel analysis and emissions estimation.

Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - Many urban university campuses are considered major trip attractors. Considering the multimodal and complex nature of university campus transportation planning and operation, this paper proposes a dynamic traffic simulation and assignment analysis approach and demonstrates how such a methodology can be successfully applied. Central to the research is the estimation of trip origin-destinations and the calibration of a parking lot choice model. Dynamic simulation is utilized to simulate multiple modes of transportation within the transportation network while further assigning these modes with respect to various mode-specific roadway accessibilities. A multiple vehicle-class simulation analysis for planning purposes becomes a critical capability to predict how faculty and staff who once parked within the campus core choose other nearby alternate parking lots. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing integrated and reliable solutions for challenging questions that face urban university campus planners and local transportation jurisdictions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Numerous transportation applications as diverse as capital investment decision-making, vehicle fleet planning, and traffic light signal setting all involve some form of (discrete choice) network design. In this paper, we review some of the uses and limitations of integer programming-based approaches to network design, and describe several discrete and continuous choice models and algorithms. Our objectives are threefold—to provide a unifying view for synthesizing many network design models, to propose a unifying framework for deriving many network design algorithms, and to summarize computational experience in solving design problems. We also show that many of the most celebrated combinatorial problems that arise in transportation planning are specializations and variations of a generic design model. Consequently, the network design concepts described in this paper have great potential application in a wide range of problem settings.

AB  - This is an introductory course in urban transportation planning that examines the evolution of urban transportation systems in the United States, with particular emphasis on the complex relationships between transportation, land use, and urban form. The content of the course is divided into four parts. The first is a historical look at the planning and development of transportation systems and urban form in the U.S. The second part looks more conceptually and theoretically at the relationships between land use and transportation. The third part examines a number of land use and transportation policy questions facing planners today. And the fourth part explores the normative perspectives and values shaping our views of cities and their transportation systems.

AB  - Urban growth and the development of the megalopolis have forced a reexamination of all urban transportation systems in terms of their ability to satisfy human needs and preferences. Encouraging the reemergence of public transportation in cities requires a total assessment of the physical and behavioral characteristics of the user population as well as their economic, social and esthetic preferences. This population includes many groups not normally considered in human engineering design, such as the physically or functionally handicapped and the aged. Existing data are reviewed and research needs are identified for the design of urban transportation systems.\nEncouraging the re-emergence of public transportation in cities requires a total assessment of the physical and behavioral characteristics of the user population as well as their economic, social, and esthetic preferences.

AB  - Urban transportation policy during the nineteen seventies has been characterized by attempts to deal with four major problems: 1) the minimization of environmental impacts of transport investments, 2) the alleviation of inequities in mobility, and financial burdens imposed upon some groups by earlier investments in capital intensive highway networks, 3)the accommodation of demands for public participation in transport decision-making, and 4) the precipitous rise of public transit operating costs. In this paper examples are given of policies which have been pursued in attempting to solve each of these problems. It is shown that policies designed to solve one of them have often intensified others. Thus, current policy is characterized by reliance upon very small-scale and timid plans and proposals. The eighties may see a return to large-scale and compre- hensive transport plans, but these will not be exclusively physical or system plans. Rather, transportation plans in the eighties will include a balance among physical facilities, institutional arrangements, financial plans, and user incentives and disincentives. Several examples of such comprehensive policies are given in this paper.

In particular, the recent changes in the Soviet Union, China and North Korea will bring about big changes in transportation network in Eurasia. The difficulties of the existing transportation network in this area axe examined. Directions for developing transportation networks between Korea, China, Mongolia and Russia are suggested with a focus to the unified Korea. Access to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia by rail would be possible by connecting the missing links, and its competitiveness could be increased. The establishment of direct air routes can also reduce air passenger-km and fuel consumption quite a lot.

AB  - This paper shows the similarity between transportation networks and thermodynamic systems. In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Institute of Transport Studies has developed a Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator (TRESIS) as a decision support system to assist planners to predict the impact of transport strategies and to make recommendations based on those predictions. A key focus of the simulator is the richness of policy instruments such as new public transport, new toll roads, congestion pricing, gas guzzler taxes, changing residential densities, introducing designated bus lanes, implementing fare changes, altering parking policy, introducing more flexible work practices, and the introduction of more fuel efficient vehicles. The appropriate- ness of mixtures of policy instruments is gauged in terms of a series of performance indicators such as impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, accessibility, equity, air quality and household consumer surplus. In this paper we introduce TRESIS to the research community, focussing on the structure of the system and the diversity of applications. Applications are presented to illus- trate the diversity and richness of TRESIS as a policy advisory tool.

AB  - A Public Transportation Facilities and Equipment Management System (PTMS), as proposed in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), is a tool to assist in the management and utilization of transit facilities and equipment so as to ensure the efficient and effective use of resources. A framework for the application of PTMS elements in the public transit capital improvement planning process is proposed. By using a PTMS as a part of the capital planning process, broad concepts such as needs fulfillment and performance improvement may be embodied in a systematic process to program transit bus capital investments. With data from the Federal Transit Administration's National Transit Database (NTD), the practical applicability of this framework is investigated in the context of the capital planning process employed by the regional transit authorities and the state transportation agency in Massachusetts. Vehicle replacement needs for a Massachusetts regional transit authority are estimated for a 5-year planning window using the NTD data in conjunction with predictive condition models. These models, developed by Purdue University and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, use easily quantifiable and objective measures such as age and mileage to predict the future condition of a vehicle. NTD data are also used to identify opportunities for performance-based capital incentives among the Massachusetts regional transit authorities.

AB  - The movement of people, goods, and information within the local metropolitan area is critically important to the functioning of cities. This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

It\nis explicitly demonstrated that the formulation of the fixed-point\nproblem - in terms of link flows for the general stochastic user\nequilibrium problem in which the Jacobian matrix of link travel cost\nfunctions may not be symmetric-possesses a unique solution with mild\nconditions. By developing a sensitivity analysis method for the\nstochastic user equilibrium problem, the study proves that the perturbed\nequilibrium link flows are continuously differentiable implicit\nfunctions with respect to perturbation parameters.

AB  - Should we invest in all the transportation projects with positive net present value (NPV)? This paper builds upon a model to assist the social planner to optimally invest on the growth of the transportation network and demonstrates the answer to this question is no. The initial model, based on the Williams’ model (1) is an extension of the real option theory to the investment in transportation projects. Subject to technical, social and environmental limitations, which lead to a certain level of quality, the social planner may determine both the date and the capacity at which to improve the transportation network. The value of development of transportation projects as real options is based on the stochastic processes for the social operating revenues (including externalities) and the construction costs. After this, the initial model is modified by defining a generalized diffusion process for the state variable “ratio of social operating revenues over construction costs” that accounts for mean-reversion. The improved model allows the process of the only state variable to describe real transportation finance cases much better than the initial model because its drift is not constant but reverting to the mean of the process. Closed form analytic solutions for both the initial and the improved models are found and discussed.

Population density influences both travel patterns and land use configurations. Traditionally, density has been closely related to transportation systems - even today the impacts and intereffects are apparent. The concept of density best characterizes the change in urban structure that has taken place in the last several decades. Some of the pertinent interrelationships between population density and urban transportation requirements, on a city-to-city basis, and within given cities are analyzed. Density-travel analyses developed to date are reviewed. regional and historical effects on population density, distribution patterns of urban density, and density implications on total person and vehicular trip generation, car ownership, travel mode, transit patronage, and freeway impacts are analyzed.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected exter- nally to be input into the forecasting process.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE IMPROVEMENT OF EXISTING METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION COULD NOT SATISFY THE REAL NEEDS OF CITIES IN TERMS OF SERVICE. HOWEVER, TESTS OF THE NEW-TECHNOLOGY APPROACH, PARTICULARLY THE PERSONAL-TRANSIT TYPE OF SYSTEM, SHOWED THAT IT COULD PROVIDE REALLY DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE.

AB  - When aligned with other services and facilities, transportation helps generate powerful forces for influencing the long-run real-estate market. Working to improve the productivity and livability of urban areas, officials are increasingly looking to metropolitan policy studies for effective action and regulation programs. Thus, beyond immediate considerations of access and congestion, transportation decisions are now expected to reflect the impacts of governmental programs on general urban development. The processes through which transportation decisions are made are themselves being modified in recognition of the broad reverberations of transport policy. With a wider array of persons and governmental units concerned with these decisions, the criteria applied to the alternative possibilities are becoming more comprehensive. Criteria applied depend not merely on personal outlook but also on the scope of responsibilities of the person weighing the alternatives. Two opposite tendencies are at work: a search for a reduction of criteria toward a single optimizing index accounting for all significant costs and benefits implicit in a proposed line of policy and program; conversely, a search better to identify and describe all the significant manifold repercussions of alternative proposals as these are viewed by different people.

AB  - There is an ongoing debate worldwide about the indicators that policy makers should use to evaluate progress toward sustainable transportation systems. In general, studies of indicators lack an overall normative framework that allows decision makers or the public to make sense of the many overlapping and partial measures. A statewide urban growth model for California was run iteratively with the California statewide travel model to evaluate major transportation scenarios, such as freeway widening and high-speed rail. In addition, transportation and land use policies intended to provide more affordable housing accessible to jobs, widespread habitat protection, and strong reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were evaluated. This model provides many performance measures for travel, economic welfare and equity, rents paid, energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, vehicular air pollution, and habitat loss. A framework for interpreting these data on the basis of recent advances in the theories of well-being for individuals and nations is proposed. This theoretical framework for evaluating the model outputs used in planning also applies to the analysis of the empirical indicators used to track actual outcomes.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.

AB  - Capital and the largest city of Iran, the metropolitan area of Tehran with its approximately thirteen million inhabitants, concentrates about a quarter of Iranian urban population. Mobility is here, as in other cities, a necessity of urban life and an essential condition for enjoying the urban amenities. However, Tehran's urban transportation system does not facilitate this mobility. The under-developed mass transportation network (bus and metro), is far from satisfying the Tehranis’ demand: the metro network for example, attracts only 5 % of motorised daily trips (2007). Over the years, the private transportation modes, personal as collective, have confirmed their place as the most used transportation means by Tehranis. However, the using cost of these modes is generally higher than that of public transportation. This causes then an unequal access to the transportation modes for Tehranis according to their financial capacity and thus an unequal access to the city and the urban amenities. The purpose of this paper is to identify the Tehrani households' travel strategies through the analysis of their global budgets. We intend to highlight the households' probable mobility strategies by analysing their transport expenditure and its importance in their monthly budget considering that their financial capacity is most likely to restrict their modal choice.

AB  - Introduction: Transportation, as a facility, has made movements easier for humans. Over time, developments have contributed to better transportation. With increasing demand for better transportation systems, which is capital intensive, research and study have to be conducted to minimize costs and maximize benefits. In the development of urban network, one of the most important and critical problems encountered is locating land uses and existing route network. In other words, the layout of urban transportation network plays a significant role in urban landuse development. Some land uses are more sensitive to transportation environmental impacts. Therefore, there is a complex and dynamic relationship between landuse and transportation. Many researches were carried out in the past to visualize the desirable and undesirable situations of transportation in the field of urban landuse locations. Some researches had focused on individual fields, such as transportation, urban planning, accessibility and air pollution; while others were carried out involving more than one field. This research focuses on the issue of developing a spatial and mathematical model in optimizing distance of residential area from road (urban network). It requires understanding the main effective factors to develop this model. Different models of urban landuse and transportation contribute to this study. Urban models give expressions separately about urban landuse structure on which there is a significant influence by transportation planning. Useful models can be classified into several groups based on different criteria such as context, time, methods and tools. In this research, the relevant models on transportation and landuse were classified into: accessibility models (maximum distance) and air pollution models (minimum distance). In this study, air quality is chosen as a key element with respect to its critical roles in the quality of life and urban health. The overall objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to plan appropriate locations for residential land uses and urban transportation network development to address one issue-air quality. Arak, a developing city in Iran has been chosen as a case study. The methodology of this study helps to select suitable sites for the development of urban transportation network and residential zones. It covers reducing air quality by the definition of optimum distance between residential zones and roads based on mathematical model and good establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. GIS as a powerful tool is applied for overlaying layers and interpretation of several scenarios. The results show the mathematical model, with acceptable accuracy, can be applied for the establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. Based on the suitability maps, approximately around all main roads, there are non-suitable residential zones located in potential polluted areas. It will be dangerous for human health of residents. This research has successfully managed development of a scientific approach for current and future model development that can be employed in transportation planning and residential landuse suitability assessment at both local and national structure plan levels. Methodology: The main component of this study is a mathematical model to incorporate air quality and quantitative interpretation of accessibility associated with the residential zone development. This mathematical model was adopted to incorporate accessibility and air quality associated with residential zone development. It included the spatial and quantitative parameters relevant for the emissions and effects of pollutants in relation to urban transportation. Arc GIS 9.1 and Arc View GIS version 3.1 were used to provide the framework for the operation of the model for mapping air pollution. The availability of spatial data types and functionalities of the software influenced the model design and plan. Designing the decision model and plan was the major task of this research. The basic conditions in finding a good location were expressed under two questions: ii) What are the positive and negative effects (i.e. benefits and costs) of urban transportation network on its surrounding environment? ii) How are the good and bad locations (i.e. benefits and costs) of the residential zone related to the above-mentioned effects and surrounding affected environment? The basic idea behind these two questions is to examine the interactions of landuse and urban transportation network. Urban transportation network is defined as a mathematical representation of the physical transportation infrastructure in the city. This mathematical process is shown in Fig. 1. (Figure presented) Location of urban transportation network, largely determines how much area of urban land use can be accessed easily from origin to destination. It is considered a high-activity land use, as it attracts people and activities, resulting in higher environmental pollution around it, such as noise and air pollution. With the consideration of these characteristics, the urban transportation network should not be located close to residential land use, which requires a safe environment around it. So, residential land uses and transportation parameters should be considered in a balanced way, to get a suitable location for an urban transportation network which meets the transportation requirements of residents optimally. This decision making process has both spatial and non-spatial dimensions. In this study, a plan were developed, by mathematical and spatial approaches, which incorporated spatial and non-spatial criteria arranged to answer the two basic questions on the influence of transportation on the environment of surrounding land uses. With arranging these criteria to search for suitable locations of residential land use and urban transportation network, objectives and sub-objectives of the study could be obtained. It was also necessary to evaluate the plan and model through fieldwork, statistical tools and interview. Result and Discussion: The research outputs include mathematical model and its accuracy, potential locations for residential land use development, and existing suitable developed locations for residential land use. It shows how the developed mathematical model is utilized to achieve the objectives and sub-objectives of the research to finally identify the suitable locations for the residential land use. The mathematical model developed in this study comprised most of the criteria. Individual formulas and models of each criterion may not meet the objectives of the research individually. However, their preferences were incorporated in the final model. The structure of the developed model enables interactive modification by changing the weights and properties of the parameters. With respect to the scenarios analysis, economical and technical limitations, future development of residential land use and urban transportation networks in the study area will be possible based on the following priorities: a. Re-designation of transportation networks (with more replacing local road types by arterial roads) in existing non-suitable locations of residential land use, b. Development of residential land use and urban transportation networks in suggested locations for the future development of residential land use, c. Removing some unnecessary roads in existing non-suitable locations of residential land use, and d. Changing some of the residential land uses in existing non-suitable locations of residential areas. The research strategy is able to support urban planners with a range of options. However, for selecting the best or most suitable sites, more comprehensive model and plan can be deve loped, from which choosing the sites from the alternatives will be the main purpose. Several urban land uses and environmental impacts of transportation are not placed in the model and plan, because they are exclusive for the choice phase of the study. Implementation of method and scenarios analysis suggests that some areas can be more suitable for residential land use and urban transportation network development than others, if performances and criteria are considered carefully. This suitability largely d epends on the goals of the transportation projects; however, the importance of the main elements (air quality) cannot be ignored in all transportation projects. The method developed in this study is not suitable for exact site selection purpose. It may be used as a generalized spatial decision support tool to support decision-making for locating residential land use and urban transportation network. Development and implementation of methods in the study area have materialized the following results: a. Illustration of a new implementation using spatial method in urban transportation planning. Innovative GIS utilization in urban transportation can explain air quality. b. Development of a complex mathematical spatial decision support model for determining the location of residential land uses, in proportion to urban transportation network. c. Exploration and arrangement of a number of criteria or factors which could be interpreted to predict suitable land uses and urban networks location in quantitative framework. d. Illumination of the parallel important role of environmental and economical sectors and users impacted by urban travel and land use activity in spatial framework.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6 % (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5 %. Introduction

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

In this paper, we present a land price model\ncharacterized by the use of spatial data in a spatial context, by the\nuse of a spatial association parameter and a formal definition of\nneighborhood that we interpret as elements of an economic externality.\nOur model analyzes the effects of some usual land use and accessibility\nvariables, and the magnitude of external economies affecting prices\nusing a spatially switching autoregressive model. Using as a case study\nthe city of Sendai in northeastern Japan (pop. about 1 million), we find\nconsiderable presence of spatial external economies, and heterogeneous\neffects of the price determinants between the CBD and the rest of the\ncity.

AB  - In this paper, we identify three distinct paradoxical phenomena that can occur in congested urban transportation networks as regards the total emissions generated, which demonstrate that so-called 'improvements' to the transportation network may result in increases in total emissions generated. In particular, we illustrate, through specific examples, the following: (1) the addition of a road may result in an increase in total emissions with no change in travel demand, (2) the total emissions may increase with a decrease in travel demand and (3) the improvement of a road in terms of travel cost may result in an increase in total emissions without a change in the travel demand. These examples demonstrate that the network topology, cost structure, as well as the travel demand structure must be taken into consideration in any policy system aimed towards the reduction of emissions due to motor vehicles.

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - The transportation - urban form nexus lies at the heart of urban sustainability. Transportation provides the physical connectivity between people, firms and activities that permits economic and social interactions to occur. It also provides physical definition to urban areas in terms of the street system and our perceptions of how locations "connect" in space and time. And the accessibility to opportunities that it provides influences land development decisions and location choices of households and businesses. In particular, as urban areas continue to expand, automobile-dominated transportation systems both facilitate and promote inefficient "sprawl" that has ramifications for all elements of urban physical and social infrastructure (water, handling of wastes, schools, heath care, etc.) in addition to the transportation system per se. Urban form (i.e., the spatial distribution of people, businesses and other activities), in turn, fundamentally determines both travel demand and the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of transportation. Most notably, public transit systems (as well as non-motorised modes of travel such as walking and bicycles) can only provide effective alternatives to the automobile if transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban forms are built. Transportation systems are major generators of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise. They are also almost totally dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels as their source of energy. This paper sketches the broad dimensions of the modern urban transportation design problem, with emphasis on its connections with other elements of urban design, particularly the question of urban form. These dimensions include both physical infrastructure and services (roads, transit services, etc.) and the intelligent operational control of these facilities and services. Elements of a coordinated research program to address pressing short- and long-run urban transportation planning problems are then outlined.

AB  - China's population was 1.1 billion in 1990; it is expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2000. Its urban population was 33% in 1990 and is expected to grow to 47% by 2000. This enormous urban growth poses tremendous challenges to urban transportation planners. The five magacities-Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Wuhan-are planning for light rail transit/subway (LRT/MRT) systems that will cost $10 billion to $15 billion (U.S. dollars). However, China does not have the money and will depend on foreign aid and borrowing. Concurrently planners disagree about the appropriate role of motorized and nonmotorized transportation, especially the bicycle: some wish to abolish, restrict, or redirect it, and others wish to expand its systems role. The global LRT/MRT experience suggests that such systems are expensive and take a long time to build. Forecasting systems for cost and ridership are unreliable; actual costs are more than two or three times the forecast. The urban transportation trends and issues in China are discussed on the basis of a very diverse array of data research sources. The analysis includes mode splits, costs, and reliability functions, and their applicability to Chinese cities. It proposes a strategic planning framework for Chinese urban areas, focusing on optimum modal mixes, investment and regulatory policies, and transportation system management. Although the framework has been developed particularly for China, it is generally applicable to other low-income countries in Asia.

AB  - Travel can affect land use just as land use affects travel behaviour of people. Low-cost travel, especially resulting from transportation improvements since the nineteenth century, has resulted in long-distance travel and urban sprawl, bringing along negative aspects such as traffic congestion and air pollution, but also reductions in biodiversity and public health. In order to try to partly reverse this process, the supply of infrastructure and public transportation can no longer follow the demand of transportation; the supply has to steer the demand. Infrastructure and high-quality public transportation should be clustered in and between large and regional cities. Increasing travel costs for car use (e.g., road pricing) can positively affect travel distances and travel mode choice, but also long-term decisions such as the residential location choice, stimulating compact, mixed-use developments. In this paper, we focus on Flanders, Belgium, a region where mobility policies stimulated long-distance travel and limited land use regulations did not hinder urban sprawl. Increasing travel costs combined with a more active spatial planning policy and a stronger cooperation between mobility policy and spatial planning can help to decrease car use and urban sprawl, but also change the way in which people perceive travel. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The energy crisis and various urban problems stemming from auto congestion, pollution, and the cost of providing public highways have created enormous interest in revitalizing our urban mass transit systems. Currently much is being said and written regarding the efficacy of granting federal, state and/or local operating subsidies. In this article, the author reviews the transit industry's peak capacity problem, and questions the economic wisdom of providing operating subsidies, as some are now being provided, and how most will probably be administered in the near future. An alternative plan suggests the manner in which subsidies can eventually help the transit industry. The article concludes with an analysis of what research efforts are needed in many urban transit systems and how subsidies can be used to support such research.

AB  - In transportation engineering, the network design problem (NDP) aims at\nfinding an optimal link improvement in a network for given demand.\nAlthough traffic demand is essentially uncertain, many previous studies\nassumed it to be deterministic. The demand stochasticity is incorporated\nand formulas are developed for system-optimal (SO) flow stochastic NDP.\nThe SO assumption is justified by comparing results from SO\ndeterministic NDP with those of user-equilibrium NDP. The difference in\nsocial cost between the two approaches is found to be less than 5%. Two\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with recourse formulations are proposed:\none with penalty function and the other without. The main advantage of\nthe first formulation is that a planner can exert better control on\nimprovement by appropriately weighing reduction in the congestion versus\nimprovement costs. The challenge, however, lies in selecting an\nappropriate penalty function. A nonlinear penalty function is found\nsuitable for the test network studied. The second formulation does not\nrequire penalty function but results in a large number of scenarios.\nNonanticipativity constraints are introduced in the second formulation\nto arrive at uniform improvement over all scenarios. Both formulations\nare solved on a test network. It is found that necessary improvements\nand the total costs with both models are more than those for average\ndemand.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

AB  - An important characteristic of urban transportation policy and planning today is the increasing role that the private sector is playing in identifying and implementing transportation projects. For example, a recent examination of the possible forms of such involvement found that there were four major categories of action that could be used to classify recent private-sector efforts in urban transportation: (1) aid to and/or provision of transportation services; (2) formation of advocacy or advisory groups whose purpose is to influence public policy; (3) sponsorship of transportation studies; and (4) provision of management assistance to public agencies (Gordon, 1982). In many of these efforts, the successful implementation of a project or program required close cooperation between public and private-sector officials. The purpose of this paper is to examine the charac- teristics of this interaction and explore the implications for transportation planning and policy. Examples of public/private-sector interaction in two Connecticut cities, Hartford and Stamford, are used to illustrate the characteristics of successful transportation program implementation. Although the examples are limited to two cities, and are mainly concerned with one major category of action (ridesharing), the characteristics of the process used and of the results can be applied to other situations where public/private- sector interaction is desired.
