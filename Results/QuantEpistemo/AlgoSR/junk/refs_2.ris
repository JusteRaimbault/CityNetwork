AB  - Under the United States federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, states must implement transportation system management (TSM) tactics in urban areas that have not attained national ambient air quality standards for carbon monoxide and photochemical oxidants. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness and feasibility of using TSM tactics to improve air quality. Based on this assessment, the authors conclude that TSM measures should be effective in eliminating localized carbon monoxide problems, but that such measures are not likely to contribute significantly toward reducing regional oxidant levels. In addition, because most individual TSM tactics can have only marginal impacts on regional motor vehicle emissions, coordinating the planning and implemen- tation of a portfolio of TSM measures will be an essential element of an effective TSM program for improving air quality.

AB  - The concepts of transport mode energy consumption and road network capacity are explained in the paper, which are applied to forecast the minimum energy consumption in a Meg polis. A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between âsupportingâ facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and ânewâ facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

Growth management consists of public policy initiatives by city officials to lessen the adverse impacts of urban sprawl. This article examines local growth management in terms of the mechanisms of policy implementation tools. The emerging body of research and theory on instruments of public policy implementation gives a new perspective on the effectiveness of urban growth management efforts. The author tests policy tools theory by adapting Peterâs three-way matching analytical approach, which includes policy tool, management strategy, and policy community, using urban growth management as the policy area for analysis. The author asks whether the tools approach can improve the effectiveness of urban growth management efforts. A case study of one municipalityâs effort in growth management provides the data.

AB  - A framework is presented for evaluating the accessibility of urban networks to the transportation needs in urban areas. Accessibility has been defined from the point of view of the network configuration and its relationship to key factors influencing travel demand. The definition is a departure from the traditional methods of accessibility, which primarily describe the interaction of people and places. The definition in this study helps in assessing the interaction between the trip maker and the transportation network, thus helping in an evaluation of the utility of the network to trips in a study region. The methodology uses the computational capabilities of a geographic information system and relates them to the traditional urban transportation planning process. Specific indexes are presented to quantify the accessibility of the network with respect to key factors influencing trip production and attraction. The methodology presented is applicable to the analysis of accessibility of other transportation system networks and to comparisons of the accessibilities of networks of different urban areas.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - This research is driven by the critical need for a technological breakthrough in taxi-out prediction, and intelligence-based decision making capabilities for an airport operating system. With the advent of sophisticated automation, the use of information-driven intelligent decision support system (IIDSS) to control service operations such as airport has become a necessity to ensure efficiency and throughput. However, airlines, airports, and air traffic controller (ATC), still lack the use of intelligent systems that can assist them in delay prediction, schedule adjustments, and optimal decision making in the face of uncertainties. As per U.S. Govt. Joint Program Development Offices roadmap, new technology is needed to accurately predict delays and efficiently utilize the existing capacity to support the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS). Hence, new research is needed to accurately predict taxi-out times which in turn can assist in making schedule adjustments to reduce congestions and delays, and provide a means for better utilization of ground staff of the airlines. We propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based stochastic approximation scheme for predicting taxi-out times that was tested on data from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County International Airport (DTW). Initial results show that the average prediction error for >80% of the flights are <3 min.

AB  - Several innovative transportation concepts were critical components of the early twentieth-century City Beautiful reconfiguration of built environments: orderly public places, suitable for important civic buildings; clear hierarchies of streets, avenues, and boulevards, organized in rational patterns with orchestrated vistas; and new terminals that housed improved intercity rail facilities and enhanced intracity travel through improved multimodal surface transportation connections. The City Beautiful aesthetic approach to conceiving urban circulation networks was an important and often overlooked contribution to transportation planning, and improving urban transportation was an important goal for City Beautiful reformers. A review of historical planning documents and project descriptions suggests that civic leaders' approaches to improving urban circulation during the City Beautiful era are enduring contributions of the movement's integrated approach to land use and transportation planning and its desire to transform cities into more beautiful places.

AB  - A package of large-scale investments in the transportation infrastructure in the Stockholm metropolitan region is currently being proposed. It contains new investments in the railway and subway systems as well as new links in the road system. This paper deals with the issue of appraising this kind of investment program. One major problem is the lack of a unique standard method, and it is argued that several tools should be used in a practical evaluation of large-scale investments in the transportation system. Four different approaches are presented and related to each other. First, one study uses a network-based mode-split/assignment model with a fixed trip matrix. The second study is complementary, as its aim is to also trace the impacts on the spatial distribution of population and jobs by applying an integrated transportation and land use model. Third, the long-run effects of the investments on regional economic growth are discussed within the framework of regional production functions. Fourth, an alternative approach is used, in which benefits from the investments are assessed through their estimated influence on aggregate land values.

AB  - A magnetic-levitation (maglev) transportation system including levitation and propulsion control is a subject of considerable scientific interest because of highly nonlinear and unstable behaviors. In this paper, the dynamic model of a maglev transportation system including levitated electromagnets and a propulsive linear induction motor (LIM) based on the concepts of mechanical geometry and motion dynamics is developed first. Then, a model-based sliding-mode control (SMC) strategy is introduced. In order to alleviate chattering phenomena caused by the inappropriate selection of uncertainty bound, a simple bound estimation algorithm is embedded in the SMC strategy to form an adaptive sliding-mode control (ASMC) scheme. However, this estimation algorithm is always a positive value so that tracking errors introduced by any uncertainty will cause the estimated bound increase even to infinity with time. Therefore, it further designs an adaptive fuzzy-neural-network control (AFNNC) scheme by imitating the SMC strategy for the maglev transportation system. In the model-free AFNNC, online learning algorithms are designed to cope with the problem of chattering phenomena caused by the sign action in SMC design, and to ensure the stability of the controlled system without the requirement of auxiliary compensated controllers despite the existence of uncertainties. The outputs of the AFNNC scheme can be directly supplied to the electromagnets and LIM without complicated control transformations for relaxing strict constrains in conventional model-based control methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed control schemes for the maglev transportation system is verified by numerical simulations, and the superiority of the AFNNC scheme is indicated in comparison with the SMC and ASMC strategies.

Policies for promoting urban growth reduce the urban unemployment ratio in the short run, but, by contrast, raise the urban unemployment ratio in the long run.  Along with agglomeration economies and inter-sectoral externality, the urban unemployment ratio plays a key role in determining social welfare.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - Accelerated population growth in general and an increasing expanse and intensity of metropolitan development through- out the world have focused attention on urban transportation and growth management. The high cost of urban highways and mass transit systems, coupled with the necessity of guiding private use of land toward acceptable levels of rational development, have resulted in various urban investment strategies. Among these, the concept of joint development of transportation facilities and high activity nodes has emerged as a promising solution to problems of overcrowding and congestion in major cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Such integrated public and private investment not only tends to maximize the cost effectiveness of required facilities, but offers opportunities benefit of the public at large and as an incentive for risk capital investment. A comprehensive study was undertaken by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning of Texas A&M University to examine the requisites of effective joint development in selected metropolitan areas, including Toronto and Montreal, Canada; Washington, DC, San Francisco and Atlanta in the USA; and Paris, France. In all instances, it was found that fixed guideway rapid transit had a discernible, positive impact on urban growth and intra-urban transportation, opportunities provided versely, it was confirmed that effective application of this strategy required the pre-existence of economic viability in general, and in the specific transportation for imaginative growth management and was, indeed, a major inducement for private investment.

They include integrated public-private planning and construction; pedestrian flow orienta- tion with respect to station entrances and exits: complete control of land ownership; attractive terms and conditions for lease and related arrangement; zoning stability; availability of infrastructure when needed; trade area conditions; an aes- thetically pleasing environment with appropriate architectural and landscape architectural treatment of all facilities and grounds; a cooperative, constructive attitude by all parties. Under these conditions, multi-modal transportation systems and high-intensity land development have an excellent chance to succeed.

Rather than covering every aspect of urban transportation, it primarily focuses on those areas that are important from a policy point of view. The article first reviews the trends of vehicular growth and availability of transport infrastructure in Indian cities. This is followed by a discussion on the nature and magnitude of urban transport problems such as congestion, pollution, and road accidents. Building on this background, the article proposes policy measures to improve urban transportation in India. Indian cities cannot afford to cater only to private cars and two-wheelers and there has to be a general recognition that policy should be designed in such a way that it reduces the need to travel by personalized modes and boosts public transport sys- tem. This requires both an increase in quantity as well as quality of public transport and effective use of demand as well as supply-side management measures. At the same time, people should be encouraged to walk and cycle and government should support investments that make cycling and walking safer.

AB  - This paper formulates a random-growth urban model with a notion of geographical fitness. Using techniques of complex-network theory, we study our system as a type of preferential-attachment model with fitness, and we analyze its macro behavior to clarify the properties of the city-size distributions it predicts. First, restricting the geographical fitness to take positive values and using a continuum approach, we show that the city-size distributions predicted by our model asymptotically approach Pareto distributions with coefficients greater than unity. Then, allowing the geographical fitness to take negative values, we perform local coefficient analysis to show that the predicted city-size distributions can deviate from Pareto distributions, as is often observed in actual city-size distributions. As a result, the model we propose can generate a generic class of city-size distributions, including but not limited to Pareto distributions. For applications to city-population projections, our simple model requires randomness only when new cities are created, not during their subsequent growth. This property leads to smooth trajectories of city population growth, in contrast to other models using Gibrat's law. In addition, a discrete form of our dynamical equations can be used to estimate past city populations based on present-day data; this fact allows quantitative assessment of the performance of our model. Further study is needed to determine appropriate formulas for the geographical fitness. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal.

AB  - Urban transportation system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops and influenced by transportation, social, economical, and environmental factors. Conventional transportation modeling approaches are unsuitable to simulate and evaluate its performance. This paper presents a system dynamics approach based on the cause-and-effect analysis and feedback loop structures. The proposed SD model comprises 7 submodels: population, economic development, number of vehicles, environmental influence, travel demand, transport supply, and traffic congestion. The model runs in Vensim PLE software using the data from Dalian, China. The coefficient of the intervention policy of vehicle ownership is chosen as the control variable for simulation, and the impacts of different policy scenarios on urban development and transportation system are analyzed. It suggests that Dalian should restrict the total number of vehicles to improve the sustainability of transportation system.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - Low-speed transportation systems have great potential in megacities such as in Shanghai, China, as they could reduce travel demand for motorized traffic and produce significantly less carbon emissions as compared with other transportation modes. Low-speed transportation systems have significant advantages over other motorized transportation systems, such as low carbon emissions, low energy consumptions, low noise, and less roadway damages. To encourage the use of low-speed transportation systems, strategies and technologies should be developed with the considerations of safety and operational performance improvements to low-speed transportation system users. This paper aims to discussing technology considerations for developing safe and efficient low-speed transportation systems. The key technology approaches that could be used to enhance low-speed transportation system performances include: (1) behavior analysis of vulnerable users, (2) analysis of operational and safety characteristics of vulnerable users, (3) planning methods for low-speed transportation systems, (4) safety design of low-speed transportation infrastructures, (5) model development for safety evaluation of low-speed transportation systems, and (6) safety improvement program for low-speed transportation systems.

AB  - Abstract: Despite the growing demands on the U.S. aviation system, the system continues to maintain a high level of safety. There are two ways to prevent fatalities in air travel: by preventing accidents, and by protecting aircraft occupants in the accidents that do occur. A reduction in accident rates provides an indication of the success of accident prevention; examining occupant survivability can indicate the positive results from occupant protection. The importance of examining occupant survivability in aviation accidents is twofold: (1) it can help to dispel a public perception that most air carrier accidents are not survivable, and (2) it can identify things that can be done to increase survivability in the accidents that do occur. The National Transportation Safety Board frequently receives inquiries from the general public and Government agencies concerning the survivability of airplane accidents. Although the Safety Boardâs Annual Review of Aircraft Accident Data for U.S. Air Carrier Operations summarizes the degree of occupant injury by aircraft damage, the annual publication has not, in the past, analyzed the issue of survivability in detail. Therefore, the purpose of this safety report is to examine aircraft occupant survivability for air carrier operations in the United States. The Safety Board examined only air carrier operations performed under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 121 because the majority of the Boardâs survival factors investigations are conducted in connection with accidents involving Part 121 carriers. Therefore, more survivability data are available for Part 121 operations than are available for Part 135 and Part 91 (general aviation) operations. This report also examines cause-of-death information for the most serious of the Part 121 accidents; that is, those accidents involving fire, at least one serious injury or fatality, and either substantial aircraft damage or complete destruction.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.

AB  - The historical continuity of old growth urban forests in the New York, New York, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, metropolitan areas was analyzed to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of historical ecology methods for forest Â­dynamics research. The use of paleopalynological techniques to determine forest changes in the time span of the past century to recent millennia requires thoughtful selection of the sampling site but can reveal unrecorded species losses and introductions as well as regional forest changes related to urbanization. Pre-forest clearance witness tree records provide the basis for comparison to ascertain how the modern old growth urban forest differs from the forest primeval. Historical floras from the period immediately following the forest resetting event are catalogs of arboreal Â­species present at the time of old growth urban forest formation that can be used to determine subsequent species diversity changes. Forest remeasurement studies are limited because methodological uniformitarianism and actualism are difficult to achieve due to insufficient detail in recording prior field procedures. However, Â­comparisons of past data and resampling results provide invaluable information on changes in the canopy, subcanopy, and sapling layers that is essential to understandingÂ­ forest dynamics and historical continuity.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an originâdestination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the originâdestination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - This paper describes several major research opportunities in the area of transportation "supply" over the next 3-5 years. The general focus of all these topics is on service design. These research topics are classified into three principal categories: capacity provision, vehicle scheduling and vehicle control. In the category of capacity provision, the major research topics are airside airport capacity, freight-terminal location and vehicle-fleet sizing. Vehicle scheduling topics include route and schedule design, empty-vehicle redistribution and routing of hazardous materials. The topics discussed in the category of vehicle control are highway safety, air-traffic control and traffic-management systems. Associated with these various topical areas are five important methodological themes: (a) vehicle utilization; (b) development of stochastic models; (c) decentralized control of complex systems; (d) data collection, processing and presentation; (e) supply-demand interactions.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - InVeTraS (intelligent vehicular transportation system) is proposed as a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) anti-collision mechanism that determines, estimates and absolves collision courses between two or more vehicles based on a correlative and cooperative wireless networking concept. The problem of collision avoidance is abstracted to the generic problem of location awareness and subsequent periodic information exchange (between vehicles). To enable location awareness, the mechanism uses one of two techniques: a global positioning system (GPS) receiver aided with dead-reckoning sensors or a RADAR based measurement system. Two nearby vehicles periodically exchange information about their own movement in terms of exact position and local clock time. Using these inputs, vehicles determine whether or not they are on a collision course with each another. A communication cluster (based on the concept of mobile ad-hoc peer-to-peer networking) is formed, that facilitates the development of a vehicular network characterized by self-organization, fault-tolerance, scalability, cooperation and cost efficiency. These characteristics enable avoidance of collision between vehicles in an adaptive and dynamic set up. The paper simulates the proposed InVeTraS concept over a torus topology emulating the streets of Manhattan.

Analysis was given on the end-to-end delivery latency, aiming to optimize the routing in both real-time ability and energy efficiency. Compared with the existing routing mechanism for the same application scenario, the proposed algorithm demonstrates less delivery latency and consequently lower energy consumption. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the routing mechanism as well as to compare it with existing method numerically.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - North American cities have undergone dramatic changes over the last century. Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005â2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption.

The objectives are (1) the presentation of a fundamental set of behavioral principles which are relevant to the planning process and (2) the discussion of alternative methods for assessing the behavioral consequences of transportation changes. The presentation of fundamental behavioral principles relies substantially on classical behavioral reinforce- ment theory, but reference is also made to attitude theory, econometrics, marketing, and psychometrics. The discussion of data collection procedures presents information on sample specification, and it illustrates a variety of questionnaire formats for the collection of perceptions and preferences from respondents. Advantages and disadvantages of the formats are mentioned. Based on the discussion of behavioral principles and methods, general guidelines are offered for the modeling and data collection requirements of planning methods for short-range and low-capital transportation options.

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

The pressure created by rapid population growth\nof Lagos on transport infrastructure and services in the city is indeed\ngreat that decline in quality and quantity of services are inevitable\nand uncertain. The persistent trials and errors in the urban public\ntransportation policy resulted to the introduction of the three wheeler\nvehicular mode of public transportation in the metropolis of about 11\nmillion people.\nSince the vehicles hit the streets of Lagos about two years ago, many\nunder-employed graduates were put in business, many un-educated citizens\nincapacitated by poverty-stricken background got something to do, while\nshort-distanced commuters, who hitherto had made their trip on foot or\nmotorcycle had relief. These gains were, however, over shadowed by the\nrelatively small size of the vehicle (officially three passengers full\ncapacity) that made it uncomfortable for many passengers, its fragile\nnature inability to withstand the restlessness and aggressive nature of\nLagos commuters, emissions from within and other vehicles, engine noise\nfrom within and other vehicles continuously give passengers persistent\ndiscomfort. More importantly, the adoption of the mode for public\ntransport with its attendant limited occupancy restraint design put many\npassengers at risk and made the mode unsafe at any speed.\nThis paper examines the policy background of the introduction of this\nmode of public transportation in the most populated city in the African\ncontinent and discusses in details the transport-related pollution\nimplications of its use on the environment and the urban passengers and\npopulation. The overall concern of the government driven and dominant\ncontrol of public transportation systems in rapidly growing Nigerian\ncities is highlighted and the some policy suggestion advanced towards\nensuring a more effectively sustained public transport systems and urban\nenvironment.

AB  - In this paper, the controllability and Hâ control method of urban transportation network are considered. Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, Hâ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - It has been recently shown that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean network flow, density and speed exists in the urban transportation networks under some conditions. An MFD is further well defined if the network is homogeneous with links of similar properties. This collective behavior concept can also be utilized to introduce simple control strategies to improve mobility in homogeneous city centers without the need for details in individual links. However many real urban transportation networks are heterogeneous with different levels of congestion. In order to study the existence of MFD and the feasibility of simple control strategies to improve network performance in heterogeneously congested networks, this paper focuses on the clustering of transportation networks based on the spatial features of congestion during a specific time period. Insights are provided on how to extend this framework in the dynamic case. The objectives of partitioning are to obtain (i) small variance of link densities within a cluster which increases the network flow for the same average density and (ii) spatial compactness of each cluster which makes feasible the application of perimeter control strategies. Therefore, a partitioning mechanism which consists of three consecutive algorithms, is designed to minimize the variance of link densities while maintaining the spatial compactness of the clusters. Firstly, an over segmenting of the network is provided by a sophisticated algorithm (Normalized Cut). Secondly, a merging algorithm is developed based on initial segmenting and a rough partitioning of the network is obtained. Finally, a boundary adjustment algorithm is designed to further improve the quality of partitioning by decreasing the variance of link densities while keeping the spatial compactness of the clusters. In addition, both density variance and shape smoothness metrics are introduced to identify the desired number of clusters and evaluate the partitioning results. These results show that both the objectives of small variance and spatial compactness can be achieved with this partitioning mechanism. A simulation in a real urban transportation network further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in effectiveness and robustness compared with other clustering algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many states in the USA attempt to manage urban growth so that development is directed to urban areas equipped to accommodate development, and rural lands are preserved for resource and other non-urban uses. The state of Oregon is entering its third decade of what many commentators describe as the nation's most aggressive urban growth management programme administered statewide. This article reports a recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the state urban growth management policies as they are implemented by the metropolitan Portland area. The metropolitan Portland area contains the largest population, employment and land base within a single urban growth boundary in the USA. Using primary data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the urban growth management and resource land preservation effort is assessed. Nearly all regional development has been directed to the urban growth boundary and away from resource lands. Many problems with administration are found, however. Policy implications are suggested.

AB  - A large number of techniques for conserving energy in urban passenger transport are described. A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0â10 yr).

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model is applied to the rail/road transportation system in the Iberian Peninsula. Five planning scenarios are considered. It is shown that modal shares are very sensitive to the cost of rail and to that of track gauge changes at the Spanish border. Conversely, the location of the terminals has little or no impact on the market shares of the combined traffic, but location changes in the Peninsula generate consequences on the entire European transportation system. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A sustainable transportation system is one in which fuel consumption, vehicle emissions, safety, congestion, and access to social and economic opportunity are of such levels that they can be sustained into the indefinite future without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own transportation needs. Each of the stakeholders in the transportation system-local, state, and federal governments; the fuel and motor-vehicle industries; and public- transportation providers, users, and others-will have roles to play in moving toward sustainability. The motor-vehicle industry, as manufacturers of the vehicles that are used for 99 percent of the personal ground veh-km of travel, will need to participate proactively with all of the stakeholders in the transportation system as it addresses the challenges and opportunities in the areas of fuel consumption, emissions, congestion, safety, and access.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The system was initially designed as a robotic wheelchair for elderly and disabled people. Hence the naming MAid (Mobility Aid for Elderly and Disabled People). One of MAidâs core functions is deliberative autonmous locomotion in rapidly changing, large-scale environments, such as shop- ping malls or concourses of airports or railway stations, where tens or hundreds of people and objects are moving around. MAidâs performance was tested in the central station of Ulm, Germany, during rush-hour, and in the exhibition halls of the Hannover Messe â98, the biggest in- dustrial fair worldwide. Meanwhile, MAid has survived more than 48 hours of testing in those environments. MAid navigation and control system is currently being extended such that it could be used as a people taxi in airports, for example.

AB  - Vehicles load passengers at a single service point and, after traversing some route, return for another trip. The travel times of successive trips are independent identically distributed random variables with a known distribution function. After a vehicle returns to the service point, one has the option of holding it, or dispatching it immediately. Passengers arrive at a uniform rate and the objective is to minimize the average wait per passenger. The problem of determining the optimal strategy (dispatch or hold) for a system of m vehicles is formulated as a dynamic programming problem. It is analyzed in detail for m = 1 and m = 2. For m = 1, the optimal strategy will hold a vehicle if it returns within less than about half the mean trip time. For m = 2, and for a small coefficient of variation of trip time C( T), the optimal strategy will control the vehicles so as to retain nearly equally spaced dispatch times, within a range of time proportional to C4/3(T).

This study uses a system dynamics approach to develop a model for predicting and interpreting such results. Viable economic development and population booming in the city result in a massive demand on freight and passenger vehicles. A basic feedback structure of the model which links private vehicle stock to demographic, economic, environmental and infrastructure sectors is presented. The model serves as an experimental platform and is used to explore the dynamics of urban vehicle market as well as possible environmental consequences. Simulation run of the model over the next 20 years is carried out. The dynamic results of vehicle stocks and their environmental implications are discussed.

AB  - An analysis of data of the past few decades from cities around the world indicates that history is repeating itself. Although there are significant differences in socioeconomic and technological characteristics among these cities, a remarkable similarity exists in trends in urban transportation. The current growth in the use of automobiles in many cities of developing countries follows similar trends experienced in the United States and other developed countries several decades earlier. Even though there is much awareness and knowledge about sustainability, private vehicle ownership, and use continue to grow at an increasing pace with rising personal incomes and desires to experience faster and more reliable transportation technology. Urban density, expressed in number of people and/or jobs per unit of land, is the key indicator of the level of automobile ownership and use, and of associated parameters of sustainability. As personal incomes rise, choice of residential and job location increases, causing a decrease in urban density and affecting the relative use of private transportation and public transit. There are policy options related to land use, pricing, and technological factors that can have far reaching influence on the long-term sustainability of urban-transportation systems around the world. The basic implication of the analysis is that urban-transportation sustainability can be greatly enhanced if there are profound changes in urban structures and activities that can slow or reverse the growth in the use of private automobiles and can make transit and other modes attractive and viable.

With the purpose of decreasing the system disruption risks, a modified System Optimal (SO) traffic assignment model was presented. The evacuation situations under the conditions of classical and modified SO traffic assignment modes were simulated and compared. The results showed that although the modified traffic assignment mode could lead to an increase in the evacuation network clearance time and average travel time, it could make the system disruption risk decrease about 20%, and the results also provided a useful reference for the urban emergency planning department when making emergency routing strategies. 2011 ASCE.

AB  - North American cities have been evolving from monocentric to polycentric metropolitan regions, with multiple concentrations of activities occurring outside of traditional urban cores. This new urban structure, with multiple urban "activity centers," has profound influence on the functioning of cities, particularly transportation systems. This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incorporates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed methodology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria. The impact of these "transportation activity centers" on Philadelphia's travel patterns is explored.

AB  - The majority of comparisons between state transportation systems do not control for characteristics that may vary greatly between states (e.g., vehicle miles traveled). A shortcoming of such analyses is that a state's individual characteristics can be highly influential in determining how transportation policy is set and funds are spent. The purpose of this paper is to extend previous efforts to create groups of similar peer states by developing a new methodological framework that incorporates demographic, temporal, and locational variability into the peer group delineations. We collected historical data for 42 variables on transportation infrastructure, population, economy, growth, topography and weather. To examine trends before and after the passage of ISTEA we gathered data over two time periods: 1985 through 1990 and 1995 through 2000. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we reduced variables into seven components, and then statistically clustered states into peer groups for each time period based on the components and the remaining variables. We identified a range of cluster solutions and demonstrate how cluster statistics help to describe the contextual basis behind the peer grouping. The results of this study are to provide government agencies, researchers and the public with a systematic methodological framework for identifying peer states that reflect similar attributes contributing to the development and maintenance of state transportation systems.

AB  - Cargo shipments are subject to hijack, theft, or tampering. Furthermore, cargo shipments are at risk of being used to transport contraband, potentially resulting in fines to shippers. The Transportation Security Sensor Network (TSSN), which is based on open software systems and service-oriented architecture principles, has been developed to mitigate these risks. Using commercial off-the-shelf hardware, the TSSN can detect and report events that are relevant to appropriate decision makers. However, field testing is required to validate the system architecture and to determine if the system can provide timely event notification. Field experiments were conducted to assess the TSSN's suitability to monitor rail-borne cargo. Log files were collected from these experiments and were postprocessed. We present the TSSN architecture and results of field experiments, including the time taken to report events using the TSSN and the interaction between various components of the TSSN. These results show that the TSSN architecture can be used to monitor rail-borne cargo.

AB  - Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities growâtheir shape and sizeâwill have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growthâthat is, transportation routes, land use, and topographyâwere directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study siteâSt Louis, Missouriâto predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naÃ¯ve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naÃ¯ve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the modelsâ performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth.

AB  - Technologies for integrating, communicating, analyzing, and displaying spatial information interactively have been evolving in recent years. Although dissemination and analysis of information over the Internet are efficient and time effective in reaching a multitude of users, it is still difficult to perform these operations with transportation data in a graphical format using the Internet. The development of a prototype system for this purpose is described in this paper. The system specifications include the need for versatility in utilizing several forms of data such as spreadsheets, AutoCAD drawings, as well as coverage produced from various geographic information system (GIS) programs (e.g., ARC/INFO). These specifications were designed to ensure maximum utilization of existing data and to facilitate data sharing within and among various organizations. The prototype system is demonstrated using a case study of projects from the Clark County Department of Public Works in Nevada. The system was developed using an off-the-shelf suite of software programs (MapGuide). Using this software greatly reduced startup costs, time, and configuration management tasks and did not compromise the desired functionality. Through its web site, the system facilitates communications between elected officials, public works agency staff, management, stakeholders, and constituents using the Internet or intranets. Various applications were designed and developed to support project management, resource allocation, and internal or external communications as well as information storage, retrieval, analysis, and display and office automation. Because of the promise shown by the prototype system, a variety of transportation and public-sector agencies have expressed an interest in its full-scale deployment to address their emergent needs.

AB  - The establishment of an efficient transportation system is key to any human development on Earth or in space. Different technologies for transporting humans and goods have been developed, the diversity of which indicates that individual concepts have specific strengths and weaknesses. So far, transportation on the Moon has utilized a wheelâbased vehicle, the lunar rover. Present concepts for transporting goods and people in a lunar base of the future are generally based on using wheels and traction. While such systems have many advantages for a variety of applications, the hauling of heavy goods will require the preparation of stable and trafficable roadways, a challenging and potentially expensive undertaking. This paper presents an alternative based on using one of the fundamental means to move objects, namely ropes and cables. Because of their inherent characteristics, ropes have been used to lift and haul heavy loads for long distances with high levels of reliability. This mature and constantly perfected technology, not well known in this carâoriented society, has been investigated for its use as a true alternative to the traditional wheelâbased transportation systems. As will be shown, innovative applications of cableâbased technologies may in effect provide many opportunities to leverage the differences between the Earth and the Moon for the purpose of creating efficient engineering products.

AB  - To effectively alleviate traffic pressure of urban arterial roads, optimizing one-way traffic organization is the key to bring microcirculation transportation network into full play. Aiming at reducing the saturation of arterial roads and microcirculation roads, the paper develops the bi-level programming model for optimizing one-way traffic organization with consideration of the maximum saturation restriction. The decision-making variable of the upper level programming is the scheme of one-way traffic organization of branch roads and the optimization targets are to minimize the average saturation of arterial roads and to minimize the excess of saturation over its maximum of arterial roads. The lower level programming is an equilibrium traffic assignment problem under the restrictions of the capacity of arterial roads and branch roads and the maximum saturation. The genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the model. The traffic conditions of arterial roads and microcirculation roads before and after optimizing of one-way traffic organization were compared by an example, which also proves the effectiveness of one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network. The proposed model provides an optimization method for one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network.

Locations in the US differ with respect to their level of access to the commercial air network and their overall accessibility within the system. Given the complexity of the domestic commercial air passenger network and supporting infrastructure, past research has only been able to provide a limited assessment of locational accessibility within the United States. To address these complexities, this paper proposes a new metric that incorporates measures of access to air transport as well as accessibility within air transportation networks. Using a comprehensive dataset on scheduled airline service, the developed approach is then applied to the US domestic commercial passenger air transportation network to explore geographic differentials in accessibility. Results suggest marked differences between core-based statistical areas throughout the US. ?? 2010.

AB  - UNCTAD reported in 2005 that 14 of the world's top 20 container terminals are now in Asia. China ranked the fourth in 2005 with its 6.77% contribution of merchant fleet to the world trade volume. China now competes in economic size with the world largest U.S. markets whereas Korea ranks around 10th place. Northeast Asia composed of the two countries surrounding the Yellow Sea and Japan consists one of the largest economic blocks along with EU and NAFTA. In addition to this economical aspect, the Yellow Sea is geo-physically a shallow basin with average depth of 44 meters. These economical and geographical characteristics of the Yellow Sea region enable and necessitate the development of an efficient inter-modal transportation system or a Short Sea Shipping (SSS) system among Northeast Asian economies. Short Sea Shipping(SSS) System is one of the most efficient transport systems to solve the problems arising from the road transport, such as road congestion, traffic accidents and air pollutions and higher social cost than sea transportation. Experience of EU since the beginning of '90s indicates that the adoption of SSS system apparently improves the total transport costs as well as the indirect social costs caused by the road traffics. SSS system is a part of a transport chain for the intermodal door-to-door supply system and most of its potential is highly depends on the real-time information and EDI technology which enables the scheduling and linking of different transport modes. Advanced cargo handling technologies can also improve the flexibility of port connections. Ship borne cargo handling facilities will bring economies of scale to deprived small ports that would otherwise be excluded in the major transport chains. The importance of SSS system connecting Korean and Chinese ports across the Yellow Sea, and necessity of its development and establishment is too apparent to mention any specific reasons. In this presentation, the practical aspects of SSS system bridging economies of Northeast Asia will be reviewed from variable aspects ranging from ship design, terminal equipments and even to port design and management for the purpose of revitalizing the regional economics.

AB  - Urban growth has been replaced by stagnation and shrinkage processes at many places in Europe during the last decades. Demographic changes and out-migration because of lack of jobs belong to the main impact factors. Urban planners are chal- lenged by this new and dramatic development that impacts on housing markets, the utilization of infrastructure, local labor markets and the whole viability of urban structures. Urban Research is requested to elaborate new concepts and strategies for cities loosing population, facing a big amount of vacant building stock and a large-area re-use of brown-fields. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the chances and limits of urban modeling to explain and assess urban shrinkage proc- esses in their quantitative and qualitative dimension. First, expertise of new shrinkage processes is investigated in order to explain the need for urban modeling concepts. Second, it is discussed to what extend often misrepresented âfuzzyâ social sci- ence knowledge about urban shrinkage can be brought methodically together with âsizableâ-data-based urban models. Third, variables and a prototype model structure are presented to approach to an urban shrinkage model. Finally, novel scientific questions and recommendations for further cooperation of social science and urban modeling are presented.

AB  - Thirty-three intelligent transportation system user services are analyzed for 38 criteria through a hybrid model of the disjunctive satisfying method (DSM), a noncompensatory multicriteria decision-making technique, and a compensatory analytic network process (ANP). The DSM reduces the problem size by excluding inappropriate user services; subsequently, the ANP establishes overall relative preferences for selected user services by considering various inner dependencies, interdependencies, and mutual effects among the elements. The electronic payment, travel demand management, and traffic control user services are proposed as the best alternatives for the problem in a developing country.

AB  - Implementation of NextGen operational concepts and procedures within the air trans- portation system will require the definition of appropriate measures of performance, as well as a deep understanding of the systems limitations and margins for improvement. In this paper, we derive an analogy between the operation of the air transportation system and that of a supply chain by leveraging the similarities between the air transportation system and the beer distribution system, and conducting a thorough examination and comparison of the measures of performance and constraints in both systems. Based on the proposed analogy, as well as previous research conducted in the field of supply chain modeling, we de- fine an equivalent supply chain framework and define appropriate measures of performance for the air transportation system. Finally, we model a network of airports and ARTCCs to help illustrate the implementation of particular supply chain management methods and lean manufacturing strategies, and help identify margins for improvement in the operation of the air transportation system. This model is further used to study the consequences of the implementation of 4-D trajectory-based operations.

Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  -  China railway has been playing an important role in the economical development and has been confronted with the requirement of higher speed, higher capacity of transport, higher degree of safety and higher quality of services. With the development of artificial intelligence, communication, computer, and its related technologies, it becomes feasible to rebuild traditional railway with such advanced technologies in order to resolve the problems mentioned above. China railway had started an informatics-based construction on train planning, dispatching, interlocking and other special fields from early 1980 successively. The conditions are ready for the transformation of railway transportation system to the railway intelligent transportation system (RITS). Establishment of system architecture is the first step to develop the China national RITS. This paper presents the current state of the research and development of information and intelligence technologies in China. On the basis of the discussion about the definitions and goals of China national RITS, the developed principle and the system architecture, which includes service architecture, logical architecture and physical architecture for China national RITS are discussed at the end.

AB  - Deanâs Words Mohinder Singh Dean LTA Academy 2 012 has continued to see sustained effort in urban transport research, planning and development all over the world. We see evidence of this in the contributions to this issue of JOURNEYS, and even during some of the presentations made at the 3rd World Cities Summit held in Singapore in July this year. A highlight of the four day biennial event was the Flagship Urban Solutions Track (FUST) series of discussions which also explored the successes and challenges of various urban transport solutions. We are pleased to feature excerpts from one of those discussions, namely, Mobile Cities â In Search of New Urban Mobility Systems, here. Also, Dr Carlos Dora and Jamie Hosking, collaborating under the auspices of the World Health Organization, present an insightful review on the various ways urban transport directly and indirectly affects our overall health. Their findings are not confined to just physical health, but also examine other areas that have an impact on our well-being, including access to employment, education and recreation. From the portals of Demographia, a public policy firm in St Louis, USA, Wendell Cox questions the long-held and popular belief that lower density cities have longer average work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion compared to more compact cities. He puts forward several key evidence, arguments and analyses to show that the opposite is true â that higher urban densities are associated with longer work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion. Londonâs splendid showing during the 2012 Olympics is largely underscored by a well- planned public transportation strategy that ensured everyone arrived everywhere on time, with minimal disruption to the cityâs daily business routine. The strategy leveraged on a Travel Demand Management programme christened Travel Advice for Business (TAB). Chris Hanley of Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was part of the team that delivered the TAB programme and shares exactly how it was done with a detailed account in this volume. Dr Wong Yiik Diew and Koh Puay Ping at Singaporeâs Nanyang Technological University provide a detailed examination of cycling mores in Singapore. They trace its evolution from an initially popular transport mode which was later relegated to being âthe poor manâs transportâ and its current re-emergence as green transportation in an energy and environment conscious age. They also present the findings of a survey that revealed the preferences and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians affected by them. The survey findings could be useful in directing and determining the future of cycling culture in Singapore. The Land Transport Authorityâs Mageret Ely and AECOMâs Elaine Brick continue the discussion on the topic of cycling in the final article, but from a more global perspective. Focusing on the growing popularity and success of bike-sharing schemes in three cities, namely, Paris, New York and Copenhagen, they outline how strategic policy, network planning, education and awareness contribute to the growth of such programmes. The various authors for this volume have generously given their time and talent to help improve our understanding of so many areas in urban transportation development and planning, and helped us to have a new outlook to old issues. They have provided invaluable insight and simultaneously demonstrated how we can never assume that convention cannot be challenged and ingenious solutions are inconceivable. For that, I most surely thank them and trust you will find this volume an enjoyable read. Before signing off, I would like to give you a sneak peek at what JOURNEYS 2013 will hold. We shall be producing one bumper volume in 2013, as a commemorative issue for the upcoming inaugural LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) 2013.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Of the various advanced wireless communication technologies used for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), WiMAX has recently received much attention because of its potential to provide broadband network connectivity, large coverage areas, quality assurance, and mobile access. However, few studies have focused on the deployment, operational, and performance issues of using WiMAX networks for ITS applications in a real roadway environment. This study performed a field performance evaluation of a regional WiMAX network in West Virginia by using important network metrics, including uplink and downlink throughput, signal strength, and connectivity level. On the basis of performance analysis, this paper discusses the feasibility and suitability of a regional WiMAX network deployment for a wireless sensor-based traffic surveillance system in terms of frequency, power, and client side radio requirements. This study provides an insight into the feasibility of using WiMAX to address ITS applications. It will benefit transportation agencies and other stakeholders to support decision making in the deployment and operation of a WiMAX-based ITS network in the future.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A case study to assess the survivability of a large-scale urban intelligent transportation system (ITS) network is presented. The ITS for Boise, Idaho, was analyzed on the basis of two survivability assessment techniques, which are discussed and summarized. The first approach provides a qualitative assessment of the Boise ITS; it is based on the survivable systems analysis method as modified for critical infrastructure. The second approach provides a quantitative assessment of network survivability by using a multilayer graph-based approach consisting of the greater Boise area power grid and surface transportation system. The power grid and the physical and control transportation graphs were analyzed to determine the relative criticality of various network components. Macroscopic modeling was used to investigate the effect of components' failure on the network's operational characteristics. The greater Boise area has a population of more than half a million. The analysis presented here serves as a case study showing the means of assessing the importance of various components in critical infrastructure layers. The results have enabled traffic operators and decision makers in the Boise area to understand the effects of failure events and to prioritize threat mitigation alternatives.

AB  - Warehousing plays a central role in the transportation system, especially in freight transport. Previous literature on warehousing and transportation connections has concentrated on logistics problems, inventory management, and location choice. However, warehousing also plays a role in the larger transportation system and may be an indicator of the level of efficiency in the system. In a hypothetically perfect world, with perfect transportation (free and instantaneous), there should be little, if any, need for or use of warehousing services. In the real world, the more warehousing is used relative to transportation services, it is logical to say that the less "functionally efficient" is the transportation system, particularly for freight transportation. Warehousing services cost money and they are used mainly due to the imperfect functioning of the transportation system. The further away the real world system is from this hypothetical "perfection", the greater should be the "intensivity" of warehousing, i.e., its use relative to transportation services. Accordingly, different regions, industries and sections of the transportation system may be evaluated and compared by examining warehousing intensivity. Using a set of measurements, we document that warehousing intensivity varies considerably across different parts of the United States and Europe.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - Smart growth is an approach to urban planning that provides a framework for making community development decisions. Despite its growing use, it is not known whether smart growth can impact physical activity. This review utilizes existing built environment research on factors that have been used in smart growth planning to determine whether they are associated with physical activity or body mass. Searching the MEDLINE, Psycinfo and Web-of-Knowledge databases, 204 articles were identified for descriptive review, and 44 for a more in-depth review of studies that evaluated four or more smart growth planning principles. Five smart growth factors (diverse housing types, mixed land use, housing density, compact development patterns and levels of open space) were associated with increased levels of physical activity, primarily walking. Associations with other forms of physical activity were less common. Results varied by gender and method of environmental assessment. Body mass was largely unaffected. This review suggests that several features of the built environment associated with smart growth planning may promote important forms of physical activity. Future smart growth community planning could focus more directly on health, and future research should explore whether combinations or a critical mass of smart growth features is associated with better population health outcomes.

In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. Â© 1995.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of determining optimal paths for routing an undesirable vehicle on a network embedded on an Euclidean plane. A typical application is the transporting of hazardous materials. Demand points, or population centers, are discretely distributed at nodes and continuously distributed on straight-line links of the network. The objective is to find, without incorporating the probability of accidental leakage of hazardous material, a path that minimizes the weighted sum of lengths over which this vehicle is within a threshold distance Î» of population centers. By appropriately redefining link lengths, we can use a shortest-path algorithm to solve the problem. Special properties of the objective function allow us to efficiently calculate the modified link lengths. We discuss the properties of the optimal routing strategy and the objective value, and offer an economic interpretation of the case when Î» varies. Operating within the framework of risk analysis, we integrate the probability of accidental release of hazardous material into our basic model. The routing objective becomes the minimization of expected damage, where accidental leakage of hazardous materials can inflict damage within a neighborhood Î» of the accident site. We also discuss our computational experience in using the model.

AB  - This paper describes concepts and techniques to measure the flexibility of a transportation system to accommodate changing demands and traffic patterns. Flexibility is increasingly desired as a characteristic of transport systems, particularly in light of changes in supply chains and traffic patterns, and the concern for the vulnerability of the system to both natural disasters and terrorist actions. Two approaches are described. One is based on current methods for estimating system capacity, and the related concept of reserve capacity. This results in a conservative estimate of flexibility. The second approach permits variations in the traffic pattern, in order to more fully capture demand variations that can be accommodated. The described measures are implemented on a containerized freight rail network, as a means of testing their feasibility and potential value as descriptors of system characteristics. The uses of the measures in planning, investment, and policy-making are discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field âscience of complexityâ has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Todayâs self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic âpatternsâ. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially âenslavesâ its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the âhigherâ level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the âlowerâ levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

AB  - The structure and layout of an urban transportation network have decisive effects on urban logistics operation efficiency. The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. Â© ASCE.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

topic of great interest. In this paper, an approach for the
synchronization and the control of an intermodal transportation system

presented, integrating public and private transportation means. Such a
model is intended to be the basis of an on-purpose designed traffic
simulator, which has two main functions: validating an integrated
timetabling for the different transportation means considered; managing
an information system which is able to give, in real time, any updated
information about the state of the whole transportation network.
Finally, some control strategies are proposed to guarantee the

Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.

AB  - Consider a city with a highly compact central business district (CBD)\nin which commuters' origins are continuously dispersed. The travel\ndemand is dependent on the total travel cost to the CBD. The transportation\nsystem is divided into two layers: major freeways and dense surface\nstreets. Whereas the major freeway network is modeled according to\nthe conventional discrete network approach, the dense surface streets\nare approximated as a continuum. Travelers to the CBD either travel\non the continuum (surface streets) and then exchange to the discrete\nnetwork (freeways) at an interchange (ramp) before moving to the\nCBD on the discrete network, or they travel directly to the CBD on\nthe continuum. Specific travel cost-flow relationships for the two\nlayers of transportation facilities are considered. A traffic equilibrium\nmodel is developed for this discrete-continuous transportation system\nin which for a particular origin no traveler can reduce his or her\nindividual travel cost to the CBD by unilaterally changing routes.\nThe problem is formulated as a simultaneous optimization program\nwith two subproblems. One subproblem is a traffic assignment problem\nfrom the interchanges to the CBD in the discrete network, and the\nother is a traffic assignment problem with multiple centers (i.e.,\nthe interchange points and the CBD) in the continuous system. A Newtonian\nalgorithm based on the sensitivity analyses of the two subproblems\nis proposed to solve the resultant simultaneous optimization program.\nA numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methodology.

In the paper the magnetic signal and seismic acceleration signal are collected, analyzed and transmitted for a mobile road target. A classification algorithm based on the sensor network is proposed, which adopts a peak and valley pattern of hybrid detection signals from different sensors. The hardware equipment system of sensor node is devised. The terminal nodes are small with low power consumption so that the transportation sensing network is easy to deploy. The advantage of the algorithm lies on its sorting exactness of several kinds of targets. The results from many field tests have been shown that it is capable of identifying mobile targets on some roads in intelligent transportation system.

AB  - Across the globe population structures are ageing and how older men and women interact with the transport system is increasingly important in maintaining a good quality of life and inclusion in society. The paper reviews three issues: the nature of older people's interaction with the transport system by gender; older people's attitude to travel; and the involvement of older people as road traffic casualties. Patterns of travel in the UK show that older people are heavily dependent on car use, but in the form of more frequent but shorter journeys than younger people. This is especially so for women over 70 years old who, as passengers, are very reliant on males to drive them. Attitudes suggest that there are few obstacles to public transport use, and most agree that bus travel is good, but convenience means many prefer cars. Involvement of older men and women in serious road traffic accidents show that they have lower killed and seriously injured (KSI) rates than 17-24 year old drivers. However, those aged over 70 years exhibit a trend of increasing KSI rates. Analysis of casualty rates of drivers by type of junction, manoeuvre and environmental conditions found that some gender-age groups are overrepresented in certain accident types, including higher serious accidents rates for men, and over representation of older women when driving in poor conditions and turning right and negotiating roundabouts, crossroads and T, Y and staggered junctions. Improvement in engineering design and driver training are suggested together with the need for a greater understanding of the transportation system needs of old and very old people. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The result has been a relentless increase in traffic congestion. Road congestion pricing has been proposed many times as an economic measure to fight congestion in urban traffic, but has not seen widespread use in practice because of Some potential impacts of road pricing remain unknown. The paper first reviews the concept of sustainable transportation system, which should meet the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice collectively. And then, based on the characteristics of sustainable transportation system, how congestion pricing can contribute to economic growth, environmental protection and social justice is examined. Examination result shows that congestion pricing is a powerful way to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation system.

AB  - Consider a city where all workplaces are concentrated in a highly compact central business district (CBD) and the commuters' homes are continuously dispersed over the residential area surrounding the CBD. The transportation facilities in the city comprise a discrete freeway network and a two-dimensional continuum of dense surface streets. The freeway network is assumed to be superimposed on the continuum and connected with it at a limited number of points (freeway ramps). During the morning peak-hours, the commuters traveling to work have a choice between two routes to the CBD: traveling along the minor access roads to enter the freeways and then proceeding along the freeway to the CBD, or using only minor street roads straight to the CBD. Given this transportation system, it is important to estimate the total trips using each freeway ramp and their spatial distribution. In this paper, an optimization model is developed to deal with this traffic assignment problem, provided that each commuter seeks to minimize his individual congested travel time. The model is formulated by intergrating the conventional network and continuum equilibrium models and its dual formation is derived. A dual-based solution method is developed using the finite element technique, and illustrated with a numerical example for a hypothetical city.

One approach to improve traffic mobility and safety in construction work zones is to use intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which can effectively enhance work zone traffic management through advanced surveillance and communication technologies. Although conceptually similar to a traditional advanced traffic management system, a work zone ITS has unique network and communication design requirements. The Palm Beach County, Florida, Interim Traffic Management System (ITMS) was a work zone ITS that was successfully deployed in the summer of 2003. Using Palm Beach County ITMS as an example, this paper provides technical guidelines for applying cutting-edge technologies, such as wireless communication, video compression, and Internet protocol encapsulation, in designing a work zone ITS.

AB  - In this paper we propose a multiclass, multicriteria network equilibrium framework for urban location and transportation decisions in the Information Age, in which the advent of telecommunication networks may provide a substitute for physical transportation. The framework interprets the option of telecommuting as a transportation mode choice and considers three distinct scenarios: (1) residential locations are known, as well as the number of residents, and one seeks to determine their places of work, along with their optimal routes of travel; (2) places of employment are given and the numbers employed are known, but one wishes to determine their residential locations and their optimal travel routes; and (3) the total number of individuals are given and one seeks to determine their residential locations, their employment locations, as well as their optimal routes of travel between. We allow each class of decisionmaker to have his or her own set of criteria associated with the route and locational decisions. We identify the underlying network structures of the problems, derive the governing equilibrium conditions, and establish the equivalent variational inequality formulations. We provide qualitative properties and propose a computational procedure along with convergence results. We then apply the algorithm to a numerical example and its variants.

AB  - The Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) is an improved mode of air travel for personal transportation that makes use of the network of commercial and general aviation airports. It is a system of highly developed aircraft and ground facilities that can safely and affordably move people among several thousand of currently underused airports throughout urban, suburban, and rural America. The SATS is a combined program that consists of three main components: new vehicle technology, airspace infrastructure, and SATS service provider. The objective of this research was to study the SATS service provider component. It consisted of the definition and analysis of the demand forecast, airfield design, terminal area, and ground transportation access metrics and their interrelationships. A computer model that allowed the evaluation of different scenarios of planning and design of airfields for the SATS in Nebraska was also developed. The results of a base simulation for 2001 showed that 88 out of 91 Nebraska airports require some changes to be SATS compatible. The air traffic control and the terminal area components require the most changes. The runway length, runway surface, lighting, marking, aircraft parking, and fuel accessibility also require some minor changes and upgrades. The capacity and ground transportation access of all airports meet SATS requirements. An ongoing research effort continues to develop and calibrate the SATS metrics at regional and national levels. The results were merely preliminary work for SATS implementation in the state of Nebraska.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. Â© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current trends in public transportation have led to an increased interest in smart ticketing systems. Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to deÂ¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system deÂ¯nition during the design process to include the network deÂ¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to deÂ¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network deÂ¯nition to Â¯nd a system-level solution that best satisÂ¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network deÂ¯nition for a selected few cities with a Â¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-deÂ¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ineÂ±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

AB  - To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities, both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes, road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes, and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads due to different travel purposes, problems from using current non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes: comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km. The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research estables a three-tier NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift), NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms, benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network at the urban central area of Beijing is built up. Â© (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - The policy of smart growth in relation to urban containment has moved from the domain of policy analysts into more general acceptance, and the broad-based popular support for smart-growth policies is likely to increase as long as economic expansion continues.  Urban containment planning has the dual purpose of promoting compact, contiguous, and accessible development provided with efficient public services; and preserving open space, agricultural land, and environmentally sensitive areas that are unsuitable for development.  Containment has an effect on land prices because land prices alter when supply is changed; and if urban containment increases the value of the amenity package of a house, then this will also cause a change in house prices.  An urban containment strategy creates a new regime in urban planning and development decision making; but it also offers research challenges as a result of the difficulties in developing methodologies that can explain complex interactions and frame the results in a way that can advance public and private interests.

AB  - From the mid nineteenth century, the City of Dessau (Germany) developed as an economic centre. The development of new residential and industrial areas changed the natural landscape having an adverse impact on the surface water, soil water and groundwater regimes. Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - This paper shows the similarity between transportation networks and thermodynamic systems. In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A basic space law was newly enacted in Japan on 28th May 2008 and was introduced on 29th May 2008. Under this law, the Japanese government's space strategy task force began developing a plan. The law calls for space utilization based on pacifism of the Japanese Constitution, making progress in national life and society of mankind, and regard for the environment, therefore the plan under development is expected to emphasize demand for actual profit to industry and national life. On the other hand, the study of the research and development for the next generation launch system is underway in Space Transportation Mission Directorate of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). In this study, two programs are the main frame. The first one is next flagship launch vehicle, which is aiming to obtain global competitiveness by achieving the cost efficiency and reliability. In the study, this is going to be realized by evolving from H-II rockets series to the technological limits. The other one is more advanced space transportation system with the new type of configuration, different from the next flagship launch vehicle with the conventional expendable rocket type. Research and development plan to realize advanced space transportation system is discussed referring to a concept of single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) reusable launch system, and it is clear that to reduce the operation cost could break through the stagnation of the space transportation system and the technologies such as health management and should be the key to reinforce safety, reliability, and operability. To realize SSTO equipping such subsystem, mass control in the design of SSTO system is essential and system design technology to reduce the mass of structure such as tanks and frames is also one of the main subjects in the research of the advanced space transportation system. A concept of experiment vehicle system to demonstrate technologies mentioned above is studied. In the concept study, technical commonality with operational systems such as small- satellite delivery launchers or suborbital spaceflight business like space tourism is taken into account following the policy of the basic space law.

This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation systemâs capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

The modeled region is arbitrary in shape with a single central business district (CBD) and travelers continuously distributed over the region. Within this region, the road network is represented as a continuum and travelers patronize a two-dimensional continuum transportation system to travel to the CBD. The PDUO-C model is solved by a promising solution algorithm that includes elements of the finite volume method (FVM), the finite element method (FEM), and the explicit total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta (TVD-RK) time-stepping method.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - A growing number of agencies have begun to define ââsustainabilityââ for transportation systems and are attempting to incorporate the concept into the regional transportation planning process. Still, very few metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) capture the comprehensive impact of transportation system and land use changes on the economy, environment, and social quality of life, which are commonly considered the essential three dimensions of sustainable transportation systems. This paper demonstrates an application of the Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach for evaluating selected transporta- tion and land use plans in the Atlanta region using multiple sustainability para- meters. A composite sustainability index is introduced as a decision support tool for transportation policymaking, where the sustainability index considers multi- dimensional conflicting criteria in the transportation planning process. The pro- posed framework should help decision-makers with incorporating sustainability considerations into transportation planning as well as identifying the most sustainable (or least unsustainable) plan for predetermined objectives.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

We\nuse the models to examine the potential impacts of population growth and\nurban expansion, as described by increasing building densities, on the\nlikelihood that forest owners maintain forest stocking, precommercial\nthin, harvest, and plant trees following harvest.

Concerning urban and regional development, it seems that the effect of agglomeration economies has been extensively studied, but very little attention has been paid to the contribution from the economies of network. This paper attempts to show that regional development is not only brought about by the economies of urban agglomeration, but also that it results from the transportation network. It presents a theoretical model for analysing the relationship between the economies of network and urban agglomeration, and regional development. Meanwhile, it also provides some empirical evidence from the Japanese regional economies.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - A simple model is proposed, at the macrolevel of variable aggregation, as a support for policy making in the control of goods transportation growth by possible alternative modes. The impact of feasible changes in the levying of "carbon tax" can be investigated with the proposed model, as well as the effects of investments in infrastructure and of the coverage of operational costs. Based on some transport externalities, various cost indices are identified and suitably minimized using optimization techniques, so that a quantitative definition of public policies can be derived. As an example, the model is used to evaluate an application of alternative policies in Germany. This case study shows that the model system of goods transportation has a slight sensitivity to the public interventions considered. The application of the carbon tax shows significant effects on the increase of fiscal revenues rather than on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and on the share of road transportation. Reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and in transportation by road are best achieved by higher investment in the infrastructures of alternative modes of transport, together with a reduction in fuel taxation.

AB  - The results of the performed screening study indicates that it is possible to transport CO2 over large distances within a reasonable unit cost. It is evident that the effect of large scale solutions to reduce unit costs are substantial. The transportation unit cost for a fully utilized large diameter pipeline over 1500 kilometers is estimated at approximately 6$ per tonne, while transportation through a 16 inch pipeline, corresponding to CO2 from a single 1000 MW gas fired power station, over the same distance, is approximately 42$ per tonne. The transportation cost should be compared with carbon tax of 50$ per tonne CO2 in force in Norway and the proposed EC energy / carbon tax of 10 $ per barrel of oil, which is equivalent to approximately 24 $ per tonne CO2. Large diameter pipelines require large investments and multilateral agreement. Therefore, the possibilities to establish an integrated large scale CO2 transportation system across country borders and continents is a possibility, but the perspective is long term. Although an integrated large scale CO2 transportation system is not likely to appear in our decade or even in the next two or three, it may turn out to be the chosen solution for the mid 21th Century if we are entering a greenhouse driven future.

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - We demonstrate here an electrostatic MEMS system capable of transporting particles 5-10 ??m in diameter in air. This system consists of three-phase electrode arrays covered by insulators. Extensive testing of this system has been done using a variety of insulation materials (silicon nitride, photoresist and Teflon), thickness (0-12 ??m), particle sizes (1-10 ??m), particle materials (metal, glass, polystyrene, spores, etc.), waveforms, frequencies and voltages. Although previous literatures claimed it is impractical to electrostatically transport particles with sizes 5-10 ??m due to complex surface forces, this effort actually shows it is feasible (as high as 90% efficiency) using the optimal combination of insulation thickness, electrode geometry and insulation material. Moreover, we suggest a qualitative theory for our particle transportation system which is consistent with our data and finite-element electrostatic simulations.

In addition to the formulation of the mathematical structure of the model, the paper reports on the development of the solution algorithm, and some preliminary tests indicating rapid model convergence and minimal computational costs. These tests also reveal that transportation energy cost is an important variable in determining metropolitan structure and the location of urban activities.

AB  - China's population was 1.1 billion in 1990; it is expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2000. Its urban population was 33% in 1990 and is expected to grow to 47% by 2000. This enormous urban growth poses tremendous challenges to urban transportation planners. The five magacities-Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Wuhan-are planning for light rail transit/subway (LRT/MRT) systems that will cost $10 billion to $15 billion (U.S. dollars). However, China does not have the money and will depend on foreign aid and borrowing. Concurrently planners disagree about the appropriate role of motorized and nonmotorized transportation, especially the bicycle: some wish to abolish, restrict, or redirect it, and others wish to expand its systems role. The global LRT/MRT experience suggests that such systems are expensive and take a long time to build. Forecasting systems for cost and ridership are unreliable; actual costs are more than two or three times the forecast. The urban transportation trends and issues in China are discussed on the basis of a very diverse array of data research sources. The analysis includes mode splits, costs, and reliability functions, and their applicability to Chinese cities. It proposes a strategic planning framework for Chinese urban areas, focusing on optimum modal mixes, investment and regulatory policies, and transportation system management. Although the framework has been developed particularly for China, it is generally applicable to other low-income countries in Asia.

AB  - The transportation - urban form nexus lies at the heart of urban sustainability. Transportation provides the physical connectivity between people, firms and activities that permits economic and social interactions to occur. It also provides physical definition to urban areas in terms of the street system and our perceptions of how locations "connect" in space and time. And the accessibility to opportunities that it provides influences land development decisions and location choices of households and businesses. In particular, as urban areas continue to expand, automobile-dominated transportation systems both facilitate and promote inefficient "sprawl" that has ramifications for all elements of urban physical and social infrastructure (water, handling of wastes, schools, heath care, etc.) in addition to the transportation system per se. Urban form (i.e., the spatial distribution of people, businesses and other activities), in turn, fundamentally determines both travel demand and the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of transportation. Most notably, public transit systems (as well as non-motorised modes of travel such as walking and bicycles) can only provide effective alternatives to the automobile if transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban forms are built. Transportation systems are major generators of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise. They are also almost totally dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels as their source of energy. This paper sketches the broad dimensions of the modern urban transportation design problem, with emphasis on its connections with other elements of urban design, particularly the question of urban form. These dimensions include both physical infrastructure and services (roads, transit services, etc.) and the intelligent operational control of these facilities and services. Elements of a coordinated research program to address pressing short- and long-run urban transportation planning problems are then outlined.

AB  - In transportation engineering, the network design problem (NDP) aims at\nfinding an optimal link improvement in a network for given demand.\nAlthough traffic demand is essentially uncertain, many previous studies\nassumed it to be deterministic. The demand stochasticity is incorporated\nand formulas are developed for system-optimal (SO) flow stochastic NDP.\nThe SO assumption is justified by comparing results from SO\ndeterministic NDP with those of user-equilibrium NDP. The difference in\nsocial cost between the two approaches is found to be less than 5%. Two\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with recourse formulations are proposed:\none with penalty function and the other without. The main advantage of\nthe first formulation is that a planner can exert better control on\nimprovement by appropriately weighing reduction in the congestion versus\nimprovement costs. The challenge, however, lies in selecting an\nappropriate penalty function. A nonlinear penalty function is found\nsuitable for the test network studied. The second formulation does not\nrequire penalty function but results in a large number of scenarios.\nNonanticipativity constraints are introduced in the second formulation\nto arrive at uniform improvement over all scenarios. Both formulations\nare solved on a test network. It is found that necessary improvements\nand the total costs with both models are more than those for average\ndemand.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - With the rapid implementation of intelligent transportation systems throughout the nation, the surface transportation system has become dependent on an extensive network of communication and computing devices. It is no longer sufficient to consider the analysis of the transportation network, its communication infrastructure, and its power supply in separation. Given the increased threats to surface transportation networks, it is imperative that such systems be designed not only for safety and efficiency but also for survivability. A case study to assess the survivability of a small urban transportation system is presented. Two different survivability assessment techniques are presented and applied. The first approach provides a qualitative assessment and is based on a survivable systems analysis modified for critical infrastructures. The second technique provides a quantitative assessment of network survivability using a multilayered graph-based approach. Three layers of critical infrastructure in a transportation system are analyzed: power, information, and physical. Interactions within layers and between layers are identified, and the relative criticality of each component in the three layers is quantified as to the component's essentiality to network performance. The analysis provides a simple means of assessing the importance of different components in critical infrastructure layers, allowing decision makers to prioritize threat mitigation alternatives.
