AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - To deal with the serious impact on urban traffic, society, ecological environment and energy system by the aggregated motorization in cities, both China and foreign countries have gradually come up with a series of policies and initiatives targeting at the non-motorized traffic by cyclists and pedestrians. Under such a background, the research studies four sub-districts of Tuanjie hu, Hujialou, Liulitun and Balizhuang at the central area of Chaoyang District, Beijing, and tries to find the interrelation between the preferences of non-motorized agents in densely populated urban central area and the construction of non-motorized transportation network. By discussing the non-motorized travel routes, road patterns and facility layout according to various needs of the target group, the research aims to deal with the construction of non-motorized transportation system in the densely populated central area in Beijing. Through questionnaire and interview, the research conducts an in-depth survey on residents' travel purposes, behavioral regularities and user's assessment for the current non-motorized routes, and acquires an understanding about their preferences on choice of roads due to different travel purposes, problems from using current non-motorized routes and thereby their preferred road patterns, and the preferred facility layout that meet local residents' behavioral regularities. By simulating the optimization of two types of non-motorized routes for commute and recreation with the Cost Distance Module, the research constructs three types of non-motorized routes: comprehensive, commute and recreation, with a total length of 65.8km. The research also reconstructs the road patterns for urban expressway, major arterial, minor arterial and connector on the road section for commute and recreation, adding green belts and low road fence to segment non-motorized routes. Meanwhile, the research estables a three-tier NMT facility service center system which incorporates bicycle service (ranging from bike renting, parking and maintenance to vehicle shift), NMT signs, informational signs, vendor booths, public bathrooms, benches, and trash bins. Thus an integral non-motorized traffic network at the urban central area of Beijing is built up. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

AB  - Economic geography can be viewed as a large and growing network of interacting activities. This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - From the mid nineteenth century, the City of Dessau (Germany) developed as an economic centre. The development of new residential and industrial areas changed the natural landscape having an adverse impact on the surface water, soil water and groundwater regimes. Between 1965 and 1990 public water supply, industry and agriculture pumped some 60 000 m(3) day(-1) groundwater out of the Dessau aquifer. As a result, groundwater levels fell by 2-3 m over large areas. Since 1990, extraction for drinking water supply, industry and agriculture has decreased from about 60 000 m day(-1) to as little as about 5000 m(3) day(-1). As a result of this, in some parts of the city groundwater levels are now only 0.5-1.0 m below the surface. The rising groundwater levels have caused flooding of existing buildings and structures over large areas. To minimize or prevent damage, extensive engineering studies and works have been carried out to keep the groundwater level as low as necessary. Extensive pollution of both groundwater and soil has been observed in a highly industrialized area at Dessau. Further impacts on groundwater quality are caused by gas stations, petrochemical production plants and related depots. The main pollutants are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which include benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and the three xylenes (m-, o- and p). Local contamination exceeds defined limit values for drinking water. A further problem is the concentration of heavy metals (arsenic, zinc, cadmium and nickel) in these areas.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - In this paper, the controllability and H∞ control method of urban transportation network are considered. Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

AB  - Many states in the USA attempt to manage urban growth so that development is directed to urban areas equipped to accommodate development, and rural lands are preserved for resource and other non-urban uses. The state of Oregon is entering its third decade of what many commentators describe as the nation's most aggressive urban growth management programme administered statewide. This article reports a recent evaluation of the effectiveness of the state urban growth management policies as they are implemented by the metropolitan Portland area. The metropolitan Portland area contains the largest population, employment and land base within a single urban growth boundary in the USA. Using primary data collection and analysis, the effectiveness of the urban growth management and resource land preservation effort is assessed. Nearly all regional development has been directed to the urban growth boundary and away from resource lands. Many problems with administration are found, however. Policy implications are suggested.

AB  - In recent years, the development of the interdisciplinary field “science of complexity” has lead to the insight, that complex dynamic processes may result from simple rules. In order to reveal those simple mechanisms, it is important to find a level of description, which on one hand considers some specific features of the system, but on the other hand is not flooded with microscopic details. Such a description should include a dynamics which is suitable to reflect the origination of new qualities, the unfolding of complexity, and the limited predictability of the future. Today’s self-organization theory provides different approaches which fulfill these criteria. Numer- ous models, e.g. in physics, chemistry, molecular biology, but also in economy or sociology, have demonstrated that even simple dynamic assumptions may generate qualitatively new features of the systems, which, on the macroscopic level, are recognized as characteristic “patterns”. Within the framework of self-organization theory, a scenario can be derived which describes this process as an interplay of local interactions and global boundary conditions. Here, the acting el- ements, due to their eigen dynamics and their specific interactions, commonly create an order parameter, which in turn feeds back to the further evolution of the system and partially “enslaves” its possibilities (to quote a term introduced by Haken, 1978). Additionally, evolving systems effect their environment, which in turn also influences their further development. The self-organized structure formation can be considered as the opposite to a hierarchical design of structures, which basically proceeds from top down to bottom: here, structures are originated bottom up, leading to an emerging hierarchy, where the structure of the “higher” level appears as a new quality of the system, which in turn feeds back to the “lower” levels. In this chapter, the approach of self-organization should be applied to the field of urban structure formation on a very basic level, which only considers structural or morphological features of urban aggregates. However, if we can obtain very simple rules for the self-organization of urban aggrega- tions, this might shed some new light on the established ideas about hierarchical planning of urban settlements.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

The pattern of concentration of economic activity and its evolution have been found to be an important determinant, and in some cases the result, of urbanization, the structure of cities, the organization of economic activity, and national economic growth. The size distribution of cities is the result of the patterns of urbanization, which result in city growth and city creation.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

AB  - The complexity of urban system requires integrated tools and techniques to understand the spatial process of urban development and project the future scenarios. This research aims to simulate urban growth patterns in Kathmandu metropolitan region in Nepal. The region, surrounded by complex mountainous terrain, has very limited land resources for new developments. As similar to many cities of the developing world, it has been facing rapid population growth and daunting environmental problems. Three time series land use maps in a fine-scale (30. m resolution), derived from satellite remote sensing, for the last three decades of the 20th century were used to clarify the spatial process of urbanization. Based on the historical experiences of the land use transitions, we adopted weight of evidence method integrated in cellular automata framework for predicting the future spatial patterns of urban growth. We extrapolated urban development patterns to 2010 and 2020 under the current scenario across the metropolitan region. Depending on local characteristics and land cover transition rates, this model produced noticeable spatial pattern of changes in the region. Based on the extrapolated spatial patterns, the urban development in the Kathmandu valley will continue through both in-filling in existing urban areas and outward rapid expansion toward the east and south directions. Overall development will be greatly affected by the existing urban space, transportation network, and topographic complexity. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6% (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5%.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - The recent urban dynamics of industrialised countries show the rise of a new spatial order, which simplifies 'vertical' relationships between the cities and complicates, instead, the 'horizontal' inter-urban patterns. Some northern Italian regions, such as Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, have been characterised historically by polycentric settlement, which constitutes today the spatial texture of functional, economic and social relationships among the urban places, their hinterlands and their regions, according to a new order of spatial organisation. This is a network-based order, whose theoretical framework is not still well founded. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the establishment of a new theoretical paradigm, by integrating several taxonomies recently proposed by Italian researchers in urban and regional sciences. Obviously, the results of these reflections are still weak and open to further contributions, particularly with regard to other regions in north-western Europe.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Predicting patterns of urban growth will be a major challenge for policy makers and environmental scientists in the 21st century. How cities grow—their shape and size—will have enormous implications for environmental sustainability and infrastructure needs. This paper presents a spatiotemporal ART-MMAP neural method to simulate and predict urban growth. Factors that affect urban growth—that is, transportation routes, land use, and topography—were directly used as inputs to the neural network model for model calibration. The calibrated network was then applied to a study site—St Louis, Missouri—to predict future urban growth and to examine future land development scenarios. This paper also introduces an effective and straightforward method for model validation and accuracy assessment, the prediction error matrix, which has been used in the pattern recognition field for several decades. In order to assess the performance of the neural network model, an in-depth accuracy assessment was conducted in which the model results were compared against a null model, an alternative naïve model, and two random models. The neural network model consistently outperformed the naïve model and two random models, and produced similar or better results than the null model. Furthermore, we evaluated the models’ performance at different spatial resolutions. The prediction accuracy increases when spatial resolution becomes coarser. One particularly interesting result is that when the results are aggregated to 1 km spatial resolution, there is 100% accuracy of urban growth predicted by the neural network model versus actual urban growth.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of transportation energy consumption constraints in the organization of an urban system, and the relative allocation of its land use activities, through the use of a combined land use transportation model based on a modification of TOPAZ. In addition to the formulation of the mathematical structure of the model, the paper reports on the development of the solution algorithm, and some preliminary tests indicating rapid model convergence and minimal computational costs. These tests also reveal that transportation energy cost is an important variable in determining metropolitan structure and the location of urban activities.

AB  - Urban growth is a key concern for planners as it has considerable ecological impact. In both Switzerland and the European Union this growth has mostly proceeded at the expense of agricultural land. It is not yet, however, well understood what drives this extensive land-use change. This study assesses the influence of proximity to motorway exits on urban growth and analyses urban growth along some of the main motorways in Switzerland. The analysis is based on two data collection campaigns from the Land Use Statistics with a time difference of 12 years. Proximity is measured as the distance from a motorway exit, which we related to changes in the entire urban areas and their subclasses 'Building areas', 'Industrial areas' and 'Transportation areas'. Linear regression revealed a significant distance trend whereby the closer an area lies to a motorway exit, the higher the rate of urban growth. Industrial areas show the strongest distance trend. Further, variance partitioning revealed the exclusive explanatory power of distance from a motorway exit by partialling out two further potential predictors, the previous urban area and the local relief. We found significant effects of distance, e.g. on industrial areas in the Central Plateau and on building areas in the Central Alps. There, we can assume a causal relationship between proximity to motorway exits and urban growth. Regarding ecoregions or urban subclasses, no uniform picture emerged. We thus recommend discussing urban sprawl separately for different areas and subcategories of urban land. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The paper shows that if the cost and demand functions satisfy certain weak smoothness conditions then the marginal cost taxation of a transportation network is optimal in the usual local sense. Interactions between the cost of travel along a link and flow along other links and between the demand for travel along a route and flow along other routes are permitted.

AB  - Urban public transportation system is a complex network composed of stations and public transportation lines. The geometric characteristics of the network have an important effect on the conditions of the public transportation of a city. In this paper, based on the computation of the degree distribution, average path length, and clustering coefficient, static complex characteristics of the public transportation system of Shanghai are studied. And also, error and attack tolerance of the network are also studied. The result indicates that the degree distribution of the network follows a power law distribution, and the public transportation network of the city is a network with short average path length and high clustering coefficient. And, the network displays a surprising degree of tolerance against errors. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that the transportation network is extremely vulnerable to attacks. It can be seen that the network is a scale free network

AB  - The rapid growth of international container handling in recent years has led to an increased utilization of mega-containerships and the rebuild of container network. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - To meet the requirement of real-time vehicle navigation, a new path planning algorithm based on partitioned urban transportation network is proposed in this paper. The foundation of the algorithm is that an actual road network has its particular spatial distribution features, and GIS has strong visual editing functions for transportation network. According to the size of the transportation network, with the GIS platform SuperMap, we partition the network into a certain amount of rectangular blocks, and then according to the starting node and the destination node, the searching area of the algorithm is restricted reasonably. With the actual example given, the experimental results prove the high operational efficiency and strong practicality of the new algorithm.

AB  -  This paper deals with an Agent-based Model of a Decision-Support System for an Urban Transport Network. The present Multi-Agent Decision-Support System (MADSS) assists the regulator in the search of the appropriate regulation decisions in case of a bus traffic disturbance. It is composed of a Supervision Module and a Regulation Module that rely on the information given by the Automatic Vehicle Monitoring system (AVM). The supervision Module represents the temporal axis of the network by the agents of type BUS and the spatial axis by the agents STOP. These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach. Hence, through the cooperative aspects of the agent interactions, the MADSS is able to perform a coherent and preventive regulation process.

AB  - To effectively alleviate traffic pressure of urban arterial roads, optimizing one-way traffic organization is the key to bring microcirculation transportation network into full play. Aiming at reducing the saturation of arterial roads and microcirculation roads, the paper develops the bi-level programming model for optimizing one-way traffic organization with consideration of the maximum saturation restriction. The decision-making variable of the upper level programming is the scheme of one-way traffic organization of branch roads and the optimization targets are to minimize the average saturation of arterial roads and to minimize the excess of saturation over its maximum of arterial roads. The lower level programming is an equilibrium traffic assignment problem under the restrictions of the capacity of arterial roads and branch roads and the maximum saturation. The genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the model. The traffic conditions of arterial roads and microcirculation roads before and after optimizing of one-way traffic organization were compared by an example, which also proves the effectiveness of one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network. The proposed model provides an optimization method for one-way traffic organization of microcirculation network.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - The aim of the study reported in this paper is to demonstrate that the subjectivity in urban growth modeling and the calibration time can be reduced by using objective techniques like Artificial neural network (ANN). As a case study, the ANN-based model was applied to simulate the urban growth of Saharanpur city in India. In the proposed model, remote sensing and GIS were used to generate site attributes, while ANN was used to reveal the relationships between urban growth potential and the site attributes. Once ANN learnt the relationship, it was then used to simulate the urban growth. Different feed forward ANN architectures were evaluated in this study and finally the most optimum ANN architecture was selected for future growth simulation. The simulated urban growth maps were evaluated on a cell by cell matching using Kappa index and three spatial metrices namely, Mean Patch Fractal Dimension, Landscape Shape Index and Percentage of like Adjacencies. The most optimal architecture was then used subsequently for simulating the future urban growth. The study results thus, demonstrated that the ANN-based model can objectively simulate urban growth, besides successfully coupling GIS, remote sensing and ANN.

It is found that, by repeating the procedure several times, a certain level of socio-economic development can be achieved which will reflect future transportation conditions in the city. In addition, this study also found some new MOE’s (Measures of Effectiveness) concerned with socio-economic development which can be used to measure and evaluate the effectiveness of transportation investment policies on urban growth.

The development of the model has been motivated by the need to estimate network clearance time for areas surrounding nuclear power plant sites, and the model has been applied in this context. {NETVACl} is a macro traffic simulation model sensitive to network topology, intersection design and control, and a wide array of evacuation management strategies. The model can handle large networks at modest computational costs and includes many reporting options. The paper includes a review of other approaches used to model evacuations and estimate network clearance times, a description of the structure and logic of the model and some computational experience.
