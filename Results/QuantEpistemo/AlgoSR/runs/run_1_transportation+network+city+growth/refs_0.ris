AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

AB  - Although in the literature several Air Transportation Networks have been modeled through the mathematical framework of Complex Networks, less attention has been devoted to their evolution: specifically, topology is studied as static, excluding any schedule information. Simulating the growth of an air network is not an easy task, due to the great amount and heterogeneity of agents interacting (aircrafts, controllers and more). In this work we use a recently developed tool, called Scheduled Network, to define an algorithm to simulate such a growth; the basic assumption is that the cost for passengers should be minimized, which is approximated with the time needed to go from one airport to another one. Some results are presented, and the role and importance of hubs (that is, central airports where great part of the flights are concentrated) is discussed. © ECMS.

Using the different representations of network topology - the spaces L and P, we study the statistical properties of WMN including degree distribution, degree correlations, weight distribution, strength distribution, average shortest path length, line length distribution and centrality measures. We find that WMN is a small-world network with power law behavior. Important nodes are identified based on different centrality measures. Through analyzing weighted clustering coefficient and weighted average nearest neighbors degree, we reveal the hierarchy structure and rich-club phenomenon in the network. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a model of a city, which combines aspects of standard urban economics and the new economic geography literature. For the empirical analysis, we constructed a dataset of 123 Brazilian agglomerations, and estimate aspects of the demand and supply side as well as a reduced form specification that describes city sizes and their growth. Our main findings are that decreases in rural income opportunities, increases in market potential for goods and labor force quality and reduction in intercity-transport costs have strong impacts on city growth. We also find that local crime and violence, measured by homicide rates impinge on growth. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is very important to study the distribution of transportation network based on fractal characteristics. In this paper, we calculate the Length-radius dimension of transportation network of Tianjin city with the help of the software Mathematica, whose results mean that the transportation network of the city has fractal characteristics. The value of length-radius dimension is 1.6403, which shows that the transportation network of the city is close to maturity. The box dimension of different districts of the main city has also been calculated at the scale of 100 to 600 m in this research and the results show that the value is between 1.5027 and 1.6312. It can be concluded that Heping district is the region with the biggest density, most complex structure, best connectivity and most mature function of transportation network in the whole city. According to the study, we obtained that the combination of length-radius dimensions and box dimensions enables the comprehensive analysis of spatial pattern characteristics of density, structure, connectivity and function of transportation network.

AB  - A public transportation network serves in adequate way a population if it evolves in time following the existent social reality. Changes made in order to improve service must be analyzed and evaluated. The introduction of modern technology to validate the fare card allowed a quick access to important, although incomplete, data. Databases with only the getting in validation information can be used to construct an origin–destination (OD) matrix, allowing a service quality analysis. Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

A region ruled by an absolutist prince saw its total urban population shrink by one hundred thousand people per century relative to a region without absolutist government. This might be explained by higher rates of taxation under revenue-maximizing absolutist governments than under non- absolutist governments, which care more about general economic prosperity and less about State revenue

AB  - Complex networks provide a suitable framework to characterize air traffic. Previous works described the world air-transport network as a graph where direct flights are edges and commercial airports are vertices. In this work, we focus instead on the properties of flight delays in the US air- transportation network. We analyze flight performance data in 2010 and study the topological structure of the network as well as the aircraft rotation. The properties of flight delays, including the distribution of total delays, the dependence on the day of the week and the hour-by-hour evolution within each day, are characterized with special attention to flights accumulating delays longer than 12 hours. We find that the distributions are robust to changes in takeoff or landing operations, different moments of the year, or even different airports in the contiguous states. However, airports in remote areas (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico) can show peculiar distributions biased toward long delays. Additionally, we show that long-delayed flights have an important dependence on the destination airport. Keywords

This paper draws on an ongoing evaluation of one of the initial pilots for this initiative – the City Fringe area of London where six creative clusters are being targeted as a means of stimulating local economic development and social inclusion. Drawing on baseline research with the jewellery cluster the paper explores the degree to which this cluster gains competitive advantage from its inner city location and the extent to which it is able to contribute to the regeneration of the local area. It thus provides a critique of Porter’s theory and contributes to our understanding of the extent to which creative clusters can act as a tool for inner city regeneration.

City growth and economic output regressions are estimated using several approaches. Since only growing areas are usually designated as towns, the urban population of districts that are larger geographical areas than cities are estimated. It is found that, at the district level, manufacturing has a positive impact on city size, and proximity to large cities causes nearby cities to be larger, reflecting agglomeration effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific arc-elasticities. In contrast with the usual methodologies, the present methodology is not based on a statistical analysis of disaggregate data on actual modal choices and transport tariffs. This is a particularly useful feature since such data are mostly not available for freight transports in Europe. Furthermore, it fully takes into account the detailed characteristics of the network, all available routes and combinations of modes, as well as the specific localisation of activities within the network. Its estimates are compared with previously published estimates, and, in particular, with Abdelwahab's results published (1998) in this journal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - The primary objective of the research project was to develop an interactive decision tool (SNAMUTS) to assist in examining scenarios for the future growth of the Perth metropolitan area in activity centres framed around the accessibility of the transport network and the accessibility of place. The SNAMUTS tool enables the quantification of the effect of transport infrastructure improvements and modifications, and of land use intensification, on the accessibility of activity centres and corridors by different modes of transport. The SNAMUTS tool provides an in-depth examination of the potential accessibility by public transport to all centres across the metropolitan area. Accessibility is measured using an impediment variable that factors in travel time, frequency of service and transfers. In this way accessibility is measured from the perspective of a traveller who also has the choice of car travel to any location within the metropolitan area. In order to provide that choice across multiple journey purposes the inter-peak period is measured. SNAMUTS applies seven different accessibility indicators. Most measure different properties of the public transport network, including speed competitiveness with car travel; one measures the accessibility of place in terms of numbers of residents and jobs within the public transport catchment. A composite indicator for overall public transport accessibility is then compiled drawing on these indicators. A total of five future scenarios were developed to assess different assumptions for priorities in public transport service and infrastructure improvements, and (in four of these five scenarios) for the spatial distribution of urban growth in metropolitan Perth: Frequency Boost (FRB) examines the effect on network performance that can potentially be achieved in the short term by increasing service levels across the network without (or with only minor) adaptations to the physical infrastructure. Correspondingly, this scenario makes no assumptions for urban growth but is based on the same population and job numbers, and their spatial distribution, as the Status Quo scenario. The service upgrades included in the Frequency Boost scenario also form part of each subsequent scenario. • Light Rail Corridors (LRC), like the three subsequent scenarios, anticipates a growth in residents and jobs across metropolitan Perth of 42 percent to a total of 2.6 million between 2006 and 2031. It is based on accommodating all of this growth in the immediate vicinity of a network of linear activity corridors in the inner and middle suburbs anchored by a new seven-route, predominantly street-running light rail system. The focus is on corridors with existing concentrations of medium- density living and a relatively fine-grained mix of land uses. To achieve this scenario a building density roughly equivalent to R80 or a pattern of three to four- story row houses or apartments would be required, and in the CBD and some adjacent areas a building density of R160, which is generally achieved in Australian cities by mixing mid-rise (three to six-storey) development with some taller structures. Similar densities and building typologies already prevail in some of these areas. • Middle Ring Centres (MRC) selects growth nodes in the middle suburbs to accommodate all growth, and accesses these centres by a mixture of orbital rail extensions, a new two-route rapid light rail system and improvements to strategic bus corridors. Urban growth in the 19 designated activity nodes in this scenario will require an average density of 208 residents and jobs per hectare within the 800- metre radius of each centre. This is roughly equivalent to a density zoning of R160 and can be achieved by a uniform build-out of six to eight-storey apartment and office buildings, or by a mixture of low-rise (three to four storeys) and high-rise. structures. Activity nodes of such a typology and configuration can be found, for example, in Bondi Junction or Chatswood in Sydney. The Middle Ring scenario further assumes that the residential density of central Perth and central Fremantle will increase to reach a minimum density of residents and jobs of 104 per hectare. Overall however, the spatial expansion of the growth centres is quite modest on a metropolitan scale, with only 6% of the currently urbanised area affected. • Fringe Expansion (FEX) accommodates all urban growth in Greenfield areas in Perth’s outer suburbs and services these by several rail extensions and new rail routes, as well as a better connected, cross-suburban bus system. All 800-metre catchments of new train stations will be zoned and planned to accommodate about 10,000 residents and jobs each, which equates to an average density of 50 residents and jobs per hectare. Bus corridors across growth areas outside these station precincts will aim to achieve a similar density within 400 metres of the route. • Composite Wishbone (CWB) is a combination of those elements of the previous three scenarios that have the greatest positive effect on network performance. It allows for urban growth to continue simultaneously in intensification areas along new light rail corridors, designated middle-ring growth centres as well as new transit-oriented settlement areas at the urban fringe. The Composite Wishbone scenario envisions all new urban development to be public transport-oriented, including in Greenfield areas, which cater for about 20% of total growth.

AB  - Urban agglomerations exhibit complex emergent features of which Zipf's law, i.e. a power-law size distribution, and fractality may be regarded as the most prominent ones. We propose a simplistic model for the generation of city-like structures which is solely based on the assumption that growth is more likely to take place close to inhabited space. The model involves one parameter which is an exponent determining how strongly the attraction decays with the distance. In addition, the model is run iteratively so that existing clusters can grow and new ones can emerge. The model is capable of reproducing the size distribution and the fractality of the hull of the largest cluster. While the power-law distribution depends on both, the imposed exponent and the iteration, the fractality seems to be independent of the former and only depends on the latter.

AB  - ‘Network City’, the latest 25-year planning strategy for metropolitan Perth, Western Australia, is designed to realise the integration of land use and transport networks within established and new areas. This article examines the influence of urban form on travel patterns and the case for sustainable travel outcomes in order to set in context the ‘Network City’ concept. The concept is described, and then the article focuses on the operational detail needed to progress towards fuller integration between the transport network and the city it serves. This includes analysis of urban structure in the context of the factors that influence efficient use of public transport: including residential density, intensity of activity and the hierarchy of activity centres. The implications for road planning are discussed where land use–transport integration is the core objective rather than simply traffic efficiency. If sustainable travel is to be facilitated there is a need to change both the operation of public transport and the urban structure and these changes are mutually supportive.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

AB  - It has been approved that the scale-free feature exists in various complex networks, such as the internet, the cell or the biological networks. In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

AB  - This paper investigates geometric and algorithmic properties of the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane. In the presence of a transportation network, the distance is measured as the length of the shortest (time) path. In doing so, we introduce a needle, a generalized Voronoi site. We present an O(nm2 + m3 + nm log n) algorithm to compute the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane, where n is the number of given sites and m is the complexity of the given transportation network. Moreover, in the case that the roads in a transportation network have only a constant number of directions and speeds, we propose two algorithms; one needs O(nm + m2 + n log n) time with O(m(n + m)) space and the other O(nm log n + m2 log m) time with O(n + m) space. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This study focuses on grasping the spatial changes that have taken place in a provincial city and aims to clarify the decision making processes of administrators and public transportation companies in Nagano City from a spatial point of view. Geographic studies of public transportation can be divided into two categories: those that put the emphasis on the spatial analysis of the network, and those that are descriptive accounts of the development of transportation in a community. This study attempts to clarify the spatiotemporal nodal structure, taking into account both the spatial profile and transitions over time. Metrical analysis and historical description, two previously separate methodologies, were combined to achieve this objective. Specifically, we first performed an analysis of the spatial structure of the public transportation network as it has gone through yearly changes. Then we examined how the decision making of the administrative and contracting arms has progressed in response to these changes. Finally, we looked into the influence such decisions have had on changes in public transportation. Factor analysis, based on the number of bus and railway runs flow, was used to clarify the changes in nodal structures. These results were then used to compare the convenience of public transportation in various districts in the city with consideration of the population distribution. As a result, with the exception of the central area of Nagano City where buses and railways are concentrated, the nodal structure on the whole experienced a simplification in the decade from 1990 to 2000 due to the decrease in inter-district connections. The disparity in the convenience of public transportation between the central and surrounding districts has also grown due to the deteriorating connections in surrounding districts. However, this gap was also likely subject to the influence of the Nagano Olympics and the extension of the Nagano Shinkansen in the central part of the city. Although the administration has been trying to reduce the number of areas with poor public transit access to minimize the disparity, which has increased due to the change in network spatial patterns, to date it has continued to give priority to ensuring access for citizens traveling in the central urban areas. Currently, given the fact that the number of passengers is not expected to increase, railway companies are focusing on increasing the carrying capacity and linking the rail transportation with other types of transportation in some of the busier zones. Also, bus companies are reducing and eliminating/merging some routes, while trying to maintain the existing service lines, which are still in high demand. The administration is encouraging policies to reduce poor-access areas, whereas the transportation companies are trying to improve the efficiency of the existing network, and although both are working toward improvement, differences of opinion are bound to occur because of the different strategies. In conclusion, to understand the spatial pattern change in public transportation, it is necessary not only to follow the tendencies over time but also to have a clear view of the decisions made and especially policies formed by the administration and the companies.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

In this study a bi-level programming model was proposed to optimize the strategy of transportation network capacity improvement in the constraint of budget. The upper level problem aims to minimize the total travel time of all transportation travelers, while the lower level model is users' equilibrium transportation assignment model. A quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm was employed to solve the problem. The result of numerical experiment indicated that the proposed model can reduce total travel time by searching optimal solution and the QEA is more efficient than other heuristic algorithm.

AB  - The network approach to urban studies can be differentiated from other approaches by its emphasis on the primacy of structures of interpersonal linkages, rather than on the classification of social units according to their individual characteristics. Network analysis is also a methodology for the investigation of these structures. Substantive issues related to interpersonal ties in the city, migration, resource allocation, neighborhood, and community are examined in terms of the network structures and processes that order and integrate urban activities. Finally, a view of the city itself as a network of networks is proposed. It is the organization of urban life by networks that makes the scale and diversity of the city a source of strength rather than of chaos, while it is precisely that scale and diversity which makes the existence of a complex and widely ramified network structure possible.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - The China sustainable development is the simultaneously three key facets, including urbanism, industrialization, and information. Building a Smart Low-carbon City is an energy strategy for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network (CIEN), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. CIEN starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). CIEN could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As CIEN is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the CIEN adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The overall growth and expansion of cities has been of long-standing interest to economists because of the association of urbanization and industrialization with economic growth. Relative city growth provides information on shifts in production patterns, changes in income distribution, and economic growth in a spatial context. Previous empirical work that examines relative city growth uses a Markov chain method to answer the question of how cities of different sizes grow relative to each other. Those studies find that cities of different sizes grow at similar rates, i.e., city growth is parallel. While intriguing, the treatments are inadequate in this particular context for two reasons. First, the authors do not perform statistical inference on the estimated transition matrices. Second, it fails to explain city growth dynamics. A more useful way to explain the dynamic behavior of city size is to use a time-series approach in which present size is determined by past size. This paper examines growth rates of city populations in a time-series context using Indian population data from 1901-1991. The purpose of this paper is to answer two questions regarding cities and their evolution. The first is to determine the effect of shocks on city populations in terms of the length of time for which they affect the city, i.e., to determine the non-stationarity of city population series. The second is to examine evolution of the hierarchy of cities (or relative urban growth) given the effect of time-varying shocks. Unit root tests show that city populations may be non-stationary. Cointegration of city population and total urban population suggests that the growth of cities may be parallel in the long-run. In the short-run there are deviations from the long-term parallel growth of cities due to exogenous shocks. These shocks take less than a decade to dissipate and for the city to return to its long-run growth rate. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper uses empirical evidence from the Balkan peninsula during the 1981-2001 period, in order to study the dynamic patterns of a conflict-affected city-size distribution. By examining the time variations of the Pareto exponent on the one hand and by exploring cities' relative growth patterns and intradistribution mobility on the other, the paper shows that city growth dynamics follow a 'hybrid' pattern, where city size filters the effects of external shocks. City-size dynamics thus seem more complex than that predicted by random growth or endogenous growth theories. In the Balkan peninsula, during the 1981-2001 period, medium-sized city demographics have resisted external shocks due to conflicts, redrawing of national frontiers and institutional upheaval better than large conglomerations. However, this does not lead to convergence towards a steady city size.

AB  - Based on long-term transportation network design decisions and potential parameter variations, it is important that demand uncertainty is considered in transportation modeling. In this paper, we present a novel robustness measure that combines the two objectives by minimizing the expected travel time while bounding the relative regret in each scenario facing uncertain origin-destination demand (OD demand). The concept of ??-robust solution is introduced into the transportation network design problem. We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

AB  - The goals of this paper are to present criteria, that allow to a priori quantify the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size and to check how these criteria correspond to analytic results available for infinite uncorrelated networks. As a case study, we consider public transportation networks (PTN) of several major cities of the world. To analyze their resilience against attacks, either the network nodes or edges are removed in specific sequences (attack scenarios). During each scenario the size S(c) of the largest remaining network component is observed as function of the removed share c of nodes or edges. To quantify the PTN stability with respect to different attack scenarios we use the area below the curve described by S(c) for c ∈ [0, 1] recently introduced (Schneider, C. M. et al. [PNAS 108 (2011) 3838]) as a numerical measure of network robustness. This measure captures the network reaction over the whole attack sequence. We present results of the analysis of PTN stability against node and link-targeted attacks.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

The effects of various externalities on city and industry growth for two different time periods in Taiwan are studied. The results indicate that employment growth at the city-industry level is: (1) negatively related to the initial city-industry employment; (2) positively related to the level of competition in the initial year; and (3) positively related to the degree of diversity in the initial year. The extent of the impact of the diversity externality is relatively large compared with the other effects. In addition, wage growth at the city-industry level is found to be: (1) negatively related to the initial city-industry wage rate; and (2) positively related to the degree of diversity in the initial year. Overall, we find that specialization hurts, competition helps, and city diversity helps both employment growth and wage growth. Our results favor Jacobs's theory, which would suggest that cross-industry externalities and local competition are more important for industry growth than are intra-industry spillovers. © Springer-Verlag 2002.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the second stage, the situation repeats itself under the constraint that tariffs should not differ too widely from those set at the first stage, a condition that frequently arises in practice.

AB  - The problem of computing shortest paths in time-dependent networks is considered. This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

A survey of related models based on a system-of-systems perspective results in a methodology formulated to address overlooked areas such as market coordination and competition. An agent-based modeling approach underpins the integration of the demand-side (consumers) and supply-side (service providers) entities to effectively capture the dynamic interactions between these stakeholders within the National Transportation System. Machine Learning techniques are adopted to model the competitive sentience of air service providers in making decisions that affect consumers' travel demand over time and vice versa. An interim model is developed employing this methodology on a four-node, inter-city transportation network, and has shown promising results toward further development efforts.

AB  - A two-layer transportation network design model with three
objectives is introduced. The objectives are: the minimization of the
primary path length (or traveling time) from a predetermined starting
node to a predetermined terminus node; the minimization of the total
distance traversed by the demand to reach a node on the primary path;
and the minimization of the total network construction cost. The problem
is initially formulated as an integer linear programming model. A
combinatoric solution which would be suitable for small networks because
of the large size of the subtour breaking constraints is presented. The
method produces efficient solutions according to the objectives
mentioned above. The criteria of alternate transportation facilities,
environmental concerns, and socio-economic structure are included for
these efficient solutions. By using Zeleny's ideal point approach the
best compromise solution is then selected. The results of a numerical
example are also given. Some potential applications of the model include
the planning of a new highway or rapid transportation system and the
design of an energy distribution system

AB  -  Transportation and logistics are a major sector of the economy, however data analysis in this domain has remained largely in the province of optimization. The potential of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped. Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining of transportation network graphs: we hope to find how current techniques both succeed and fail on this problem, and from the failures, we hope to present new challenges for data mining. Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data mining techniques to real transportation network data are provided, including new approaches to making these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are not appropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate research and galvanize future work in this area.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Using two comprehensive datasets on populations of cities and metropolitan areas for a large set of countries, I present three new empirical facts about the evolution of city growth. First, the distribution of cities' growth rates is skewed to the right in most countries and decades. Second, within a country, the average rank of each decade's fastest-growing cities tends to rise over time. Finally, this rank increases faster in periods of rapid growth in urban population. These facts can be interpreted as evidence in favor of the hypothesis that historically, urban agglomerations have followed a sequential growth pattern: Within a country, the initially largest city is the first to grow rapidly for some years. At some point, the growth rate of this city slows down and the second-largest city then becomes the fastest-growing one. Eventually, the third-largest city starts growing fast as the two largest cities slow down, and so on. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new\nand redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is\nconcerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway)\nnetwork users. This paper presents a hi-level optimization model-in\nwhich the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first\ntime-for solving the public transportation network redesign problem\n(PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total\ncost, including user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost,\nfor the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource-\nand policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user\nself-routing optimization problem in which all transit users try to find\nthe transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number\nof transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic\nalgorithm-based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP hi-level\noptimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical\nresults are described. Future research directions are also given.

AB  - In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Then, some methodological tools mainly applied in the field of transportation science can be used to discuss the eco-industrial chain network problem. What the highlighted contribution lies in is that the paper not only expands theory of supply chain model with reducing path flow but also generalizes the traditional transportation network equilibrium problem by new applications.

AB  - In transportation engineering, the network design problem (NDP) aims at\nfinding an optimal link improvement in a network for given demand.\nAlthough traffic demand is essentially uncertain, many previous studies\nassumed it to be deterministic. The demand stochasticity is incorporated\nand formulas are developed for system-optimal (SO) flow stochastic NDP.\nThe SO assumption is justified by comparing results from SO\ndeterministic NDP with those of user-equilibrium NDP. The difference in\nsocial cost between the two approaches is found to be less than 5%. Two\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with recourse formulations are proposed:\none with penalty function and the other without. The main advantage of\nthe first formulation is that a planner can exert better control on\nimprovement by appropriately weighing reduction in the congestion versus\nimprovement costs. The challenge, however, lies in selecting an\nappropriate penalty function. A nonlinear penalty function is found\nsuitable for the test network studied. The second formulation does not\nrequire penalty function but results in a large number of scenarios.\nNonanticipativity constraints are introduced in the second formulation\nto arrive at uniform improvement over all scenarios. Both formulations\nare solved on a test network. It is found that necessary improvements\nand the total costs with both models are more than those for average\ndemand.

AB  - This work builds further on the Orbital Transportation Network Analysis methodology proposed by the authors in earlier research. Through a review of the literature of flexibility, the different types of flexibility that can apply to an orbital transportation network, and their relationships to the system architecture, are explored. Finally a provider- side flexibility metric is defined as a combination of the different types of flexibilities. The resulting metric can then be used in addition to performance and value metrics to rank the best architectures for the orbital transportation network. It is argued that service flexibility for an orbital transportation network can be defined as the combination of three types of flexibilities, which play out in different time frames: Mix flexibility (long-term), Volume flexibility (mid-term), and emergency service flexibility (short term). Using these definitions, different architectures for an orbital transportation network were evaluated on the basis of their flexibility, value, and performance metrics.

The new transportation network efficiency measure allows one to determine the criticality of various nodes (as well as links) as we demonstrate through a network component importance definition, which is well-defined even if the network becomes disconnected. Several illustrative transportation network ex- amples are provided in which the efficiencies and importance of network components are explicitly computed, and their rankings tabulated.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to set up a growth model for a world city, in order to determine the roles of government and enterprises. With the model, the authors of this paper want to test the efficiencies between governmental and enterprise investment for the experience of Beijing. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proves the contributions of enterprise and governmental investment for a world city by three assumptions. It then sets up a growth model for a world city by taking the variable of governmental investment instead of the labor variable in the Solow Growth Model. With C-D function, the paper sets up an empirical growth model of the world city of Beijing by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Findings - Results of OLS show that the elasticity of enterprises operating surplus to world city growth is bigger than the one of governmental expenditure to world city growth, which indicates that the investment ability of the private sector has more efficient effectiveness on a world city than governmental investment. Meanwhile, technological progress also has weak effectiveness for world city growth from the regression of C-D function. Practical implications - When the public and private sectors were taken into account for world city growth, the role of government investment is constructing a fair environment for enterprises' competition and encouraging innovation in the private sector, as well as enhancing efficient policy for innovation application in the private sector. Originality/value - The paper sets up a growth model with the variables of private and public factors taking the place of the variable of labor in the Solow Growth Model with government investment. The model can be adopted to explain the dynamics of world city growth in a transition economy.

AB  - The rapid growth of international container handling in recent years has led to an increased utilization of mega-containerships and the rebuild of container network. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - In connection with the network realization problem the main questions of the algorithm are which edges to choose and what is the budget consequence of that. These problems can be solved by exact optimization methods, but in this case the number of computational steps (additions and comparisons) is an exponential function of the number of nodes. For this reason usually heuristic methods are chosen for solving these problems. Some special problems can be formulated as maximal flow problems. To get the solution we use only maximal flow and shortest route algorithms. Thus we decrease the number of computations, but the size of the network will grow. In this paper, we describe this algorithm to solve the network realization problem. Then we give a transportation network realization problem and show how to solve this problem by the some algorithms.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - We present an approach to systematically analyzing the vulnerability\nof road networks under\n\ndisruptions covering extended areas. Since various kinds of events\nincluding floods, heavy\n\nsnowfall, storms and wildfires can cause such spatially spread degradations,\nthe analysis method is\n\nan important complement to the existing studies of single link failures.\nThe methodology involves\n\ncovering the study area with grids of uniformly shaped and sized cells,\nwhere each cell represents\n\nthe extent of an event disrupting any intersecting links. We apply\nthe approach to the Swedish\n\nroad network using travel demand and network data from the Swedish\ntransport modeling system\n\nSampers. Among other things, the study shows that the impacts of area-covering\ndisruptions are\n\nlargely determined by the level of internal, outbound and inbound\ntravel demand of the affected\n\narea itself. This is unlike single link failures, where the link flow\nand the redundancy in the\n\nsurrounding network determine the impacts. As a result, the vulnerability\nto spatially spread\n\nevents shows a markedly different geographical distribution. These\nfindings, which should be\n\nuniversal for most road networks of similar scale, are important in\nthe planning process of\n\nresource allocation for mitigation and recovery.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.
