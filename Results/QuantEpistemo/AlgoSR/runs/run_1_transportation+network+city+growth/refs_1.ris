AB  - It is very important to study the distribution of transportation network based on fractal characteristics. In this paper, we calculate the Length-radius dimension of transportation network of Tianjin city with the help of the software Mathematica, whose results mean that the transportation network of the city has fractal characteristics. The value of length-radius dimension is 1.6403, which shows that the transportation network of the city is close to maturity. The box dimension of different districts of the main city has also been calculated at the scale of 100 to 600 m in this research and the results show that the value is between 1.5027 and 1.6312. It can be concluded that Heping district is the region with the biggest density, most complex structure, best connectivity and most mature function of transportation network in the whole city. According to the study, we obtained that the combination of length-radius dimensions and box dimensions enables the comprehensive analysis of spatial pattern characteristics of density, structure, connectivity and function of transportation network.

AB  - As measured by the pace of city growth in western Europe from 1000 to 1800, absolutist monarchs stunted the growth of commerce and industry. A region ruled by an absolutist prince saw its total urban population shrink by one hundred thousand people per century relative to a region without absolutist government. This might be explained by higher rates of taxation under revenue-maximizing absolutist governments than under non- absolutist governments, which care more about general economic prosperity and less about State revenue

AB  - Smart cards are portable tamper-resistant cryptographic devices that play a key role in digital security. This paper reviews the latest use of smart cards in securing network, online services, operating systems, and card-holder identity. Smart card network authentication is routinely used on GSM and 3G networks, and this paper shows how the same infrastructure can be extended to perform WiFi access point authentication. Securing online services with smart card is traditionally performed using public key cryptography and certificates, or using one-time-passwords. This paper presents new smart card authentication methods that either allow to reuse already issued cards or infrastructure, or provide stronger card-to-server mutual authentication. Finally, the paper will show how smart cards and trusted platform module have complementary roles for recuring the operating systems, and the use of smart cards in identity frameworks such as liberty alliance or Microsoft cardspace.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - This paper examines the problem of locating additional passenger facilities on a transportation network to supplement ones that already exist. A distinction is made between “supporting” facilities which operate only in concert with already existing ones and “new” facilities which are self-sufficient and operate independently. It is shown that, when the objective is to maximize the utility of travel times to all users, at least one set of optimal locations for the new facilities exist on the nodes of the network if the utility function for travel times is convex. This result is proven under very general conditions including the assumption of a probabilistic transportation network, i.e. a network where travel times on network branches are random variables. A straightforward algorithm for solving a specific simple case is also provided and the results are illustrated by examples.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

This article examines the influence of urban form on travel patterns and the case for sustainable travel outcomes in order to set in context the ‘Network City’ concept. The concept is described, and then the article focuses on the operational detail needed to progress towards fuller integration between the transport network and the city it serves. This includes analysis of urban structure in the context of the factors that influence efficient use of public transport: including residential density, intensity of activity and the hierarchy of activity centres. The implications for road planning are discussed where land use–transport integration is the core objective rather than simply traffic efficiency. If sustainable travel is to be facilitated there is a need to change both the operation of public transport and the urban structure and these changes are mutually supportive.

AB  - It has been approved that the scale-free feature exists in various complex networks, such as the internet, the cell or the biological networks. In order to analyze the influence of the self-growth phenomenon during the growth on the structure of traffic and transportation network, we formulated an evolving model. Based on the evolving model, we prove in mathematics that, even that the self-growth situation happened, the traffic and transportation network owns the scale-free feature due to that the node degree follows a power-law distribution. A real traffic and transportation network, China domestic airline network is tested to consolidate our conclusions. We find that the airline network has a node degree distribution equivalent to the power-law of which the estimated scaling parameter is about 3.0. Moreover the standard error of the estimated scaling parameter changes according to the self-growth probability. Our findings could provide useful information for determining the optimal structure or status of the traffic and transportation network.

Such problem can be formulated as an optimization problem by taking traffic assignment as a constraint. Due to the non-differentiability of the perturbed solutions in equilibrium constraints, a non-smooth optimization model is established. A globally convergent iterative scheme designed to heuristically search for a local optimum is proposed. Numerical illustrations are conducted through a hypothetical network from the literature. As it shows from numerical calculations, the proposed algorithm achieved substantially better performance than did the previous for a toll design network with signal settings. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Network location models have been used extensively for siting public and private facilities. In this paper, we investigate a model that simultaneously optimizes facility locations and the design of the underlying transportation network. Motivated by the simple observation that changing the network topology is often more cost-effective than adding facilities to improve service levels, the model has a number of applications in regional planning, distribution, energy management, and other areas. The model generalizes the classical simple plant location problem. We show how the model can be solved effectively. We then use the model to analyze two potential transportation planning scenarios. The fundamental question of resource allocation between facilities and links is investigated, and a detailed sensitivity analysis provides insight into the model's usefulness for aiding budgeting and planning decisions. We conclude by identifying promising research directions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates a routing problem in a public transportation network, more precisely the problem of finding an optimal journey plan in a transportation network, given a timetable. The following issues are discussed: a graph model of a transportation network that takes into account changes of means of transport in a non-zero time; reduction of a large network to a network with a smaller number of nodes and arcs, and algorithms that find an optimal connection by different optimality criteria given. It is shown that the routing problem is closely related to the shortest-path problem in a weighted graph. However, well-known graph-theory algorithms cannot be directly applied as the time factor and the effect of changing means of transport require a specific approach. Moreover, miscellaneous constraints may be imposed on the set of acceptable routes. An implementation of the presented approach in a commercial routing program has been described. © 1995.

A quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm was employed to solve the problem. The result of numerical experiment indicated that the proposed model can reduce total travel time by searching optimal solution and the QEA is more efficient than other heuristic algorithm.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of determining optimal paths for routing an undesirable vehicle on a network embedded on an Euclidean plane. A typical application is the transporting of hazardous materials. Demand points, or population centers, are discretely distributed at nodes and continuously distributed on straight-line links of the network. The objective is to find, without incorporating the probability of accidental leakage of hazardous material, a path that minimizes the weighted sum of lengths over which this vehicle is within a threshold distance λ of population centers. By appropriately redefining link lengths, we can use a shortest-path algorithm to solve the problem. Special properties of the objective function allow us to efficiently calculate the modified link lengths. We discuss the properties of the optimal routing strategy and the objective value, and offer an economic interpretation of the case when λ varies. Operating within the framework of risk analysis, we integrate the probability of accidental release of hazardous material into our basic model. The routing objective becomes the minimization of expected damage, where accidental leakage of hazardous materials can inflict damage within a neighborhood λ of the accident site. We also discuss our computational experience in using the model.

AB  - The network approach to urban studies can be differentiated from other approaches by its emphasis on the primacy of structures of interpersonal linkages, rather than on the classification of social units according to their individual characteristics. Network analysis is also a methodology for the investigation of these structures. Substantive issues related to interpersonal ties in the city, migration, resource allocation, neighborhood, and community are examined in terms of the network structures and processes that order and integrate urban activities. Finally, a view of the city itself as a network of networks is proposed. It is the organization of urban life by networks that makes the scale and diversity of the city a source of strength rather than of chaos, while it is precisely that scale and diversity which makes the existence of a complex and widely ramified network structure possible.

Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model.

AB  - This paper proposes a global optimization algorithm for solving a mixed (continuous/discrete) transportation network design problem (MNDP), which is generally expressed as a mathematical programming with equilibrium constraint (MPEC). The upper level of the MNDP aims to optimize the network performance via both expansion of existing links and addition of new candidate links, whereas the lower level is a traditional Wardrop user equilibrium (UE) problem. In this paper, we first formulate the UE condition as a variational inequality (VI) problem, which is defined from a finite number of extreme points of a link-flow feasible region. The MNDP is approximated as a piecewise-linear programming (P-LP) problem, which is then transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. A global optimization algorithm based on a cutting constraint method is developed for solving the MILP problem. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and to compare the results with alternative algorithms reported in the literature.

AB  - This paper uses empirical evidence from the Balkan peninsula during the 1981-2001 period, in order to study the dynamic patterns of a conflict-affected city-size distribution. By examining the time variations of the Pareto exponent on the one hand and by exploring cities' relative growth patterns and intradistribution mobility on the other, the paper shows that city growth dynamics follow a 'hybrid' pattern, where city size filters the effects of external shocks. City-size dynamics thus seem more complex than that predicted by random growth or endogenous growth theories. In the Balkan peninsula, during the 1981-2001 period, medium-sized city demographics have resisted external shocks due to conflicts, redrawing of national frontiers and institutional upheaval better than large conglomerations. However, this does not lead to convergence towards a steady city size.

AB  - In this paper, an intelligent transportation control system (ITCS) using wavelet neural network (WNN) and proportional-integral-derivative-type (PID-type) learning algorithms is developed to increase the safety and efficiency in transportation process. The proposed control system is composed of a neural controller and an auxiliary compensation controller. The neural controller acts as the main tracking controller, which is designed via a WNN to mimic the merits of an ideal total sliding-mode control (TSMC) law. The PID-type learning algorithms are derived from the Lyapunov stability theorem, which are utilized to adjust the parameters of WNN on-line for further assuring system stability and obtaining a fast convergence. Moreover, based on H∞ control technique, the auxiliary compensation controller is developed to attenuate the effect of the approximation error between WNN and ideal TSMC law, so that the desired attenuation level can be achieved. Finally, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy, it is applied to control a marine transportation system and a land transportation system. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed WNN-based ITCS with PID-type learning algorithms can achieve favorable control performance than other control methods.

AB  - Collaborative product development is becoming more valuable because of the increasing coordination and management complexity of organizational information, responsibilities, schedules, deliverables, product information, and business process. As outsourcing and globalization increase the number of design chain participants, a collaborative product development speeds up the decision-making of trusted partners, employees, suppliers, and customers in design chains. Due to continuous changes in design projects, delays in product developments are common. Thus, a change control workflow is needed among design chain participants for product development. A distributed change control workflow for design network is therefore proposed in this study. This type of workflow is a two-layer approach derived from the principles of configuration management and routing algorithm. It has been validated that the consistencies of designs from each participants in design chain is maintained by applying the proposed distributed change control workflow. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influences of citywide and city-industry externalities on city growth. The effects of various externalities on city and industry growth for two different time periods in Taiwan are studied. The results indicate that employment growth at the city-industry level is: (1) negatively related to the initial city-industry employment; (2) positively related to the level of competition in the initial year; and (3) positively related to the degree of diversity in the initial year. The extent of the impact of the diversity externality is relatively large compared with the other effects. In addition, wage growth at the city-industry level is found to be: (1) negatively related to the initial city-industry wage rate; and (2) positively related to the degree of diversity in the initial year. Overall, we find that specialization hurts, competition helps, and city diversity helps both employment growth and wage growth. Our results favor Jacobs's theory, which would suggest that cross-industry externalities and local competition are more important for industry growth than are intra-industry spillovers. © Springer-Verlag 2002.

AB  - A discomforting reality has materialized on the transportation scene: our existing air and ground infrastructures will not scale to meet our nation's 21st century demands and expectations for mobility, commerce, safety, and security. The consequence of inaction is diminished quality of life and economic opportunity in the 21st century. Clearly, new thinking is required for transportation that can scale to meet to the realities of a networked, knowledge-based economy in which the value of time is a new coin of the realm. This paper proposes a framework, or topology, for thinking about the problem of scalability of the system of networks that comprise the aviation system. This framework highlights the role of integrated communication-navigation-surveillance systems in enabling scalability of future air transportation networks. Scalability, in this vein, is a goal of the recently formed Joint Planning and Development Office for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. New foundations for 21st thinking about air transportation are underpinned by several technological developments in the traditional aircraft disciplines as well as in communication, navigation, surveillance and information systems. Complexity science and modern network theory give rise to one of the technological developments of importance. Scale-free (i.e., scalable) networks represent a promising concept space for modeling airspace system architectures, and for assessing network performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, robustness, resilience, and other metrics. The paper offers an air transportation system topology as framework for transportation system innovation. Successful outcomes of innovation in air transportation could lay the foundations for new paradigms for aircraft and their operating capabilities, air transportation system architectures, and airspace architectures and procedural concepts. The topology proposed considers air transportation as a system of networks, within which strategies for scalability of the topology may be enabled by technologies and policies. In particular, the effects of scalable ICNS concepts are evaluated within this proposed topology. Alternative business models are appearing on the scene as the old centralized hub-and-spoke model reaches the limits of its scalability. These models include growth of point-to-point scheduled air transportation service (e.g., the RJ phenomenon and the Southwest Effect). Another is a new business model for on-demand, widely distributed, air mobility in jet taxi services. The new businesses forming around this vision are targeting personal air mobility to virtually any of the thousands of origins and destinations throughout suburban, rural, and remote communities and regions. Such advancement in air mobility has many implications for requirements for airports, airspace, and consumers. These new paradigms could support scalable alternatives for the expansion of future air mobility to more consumers in more places.

By analyzing the constituent structure of composite network, choosing attributes and analyzing travel impedances, the composite traffic system network was established, and the traffic assignment law in the composite network was explained. Thus, a model is proposed to describe the multimodal composite transportation network. Finally, simulation process of transport planning was proposed and explained by taking Yang Hu Yuan Area planning in Changsha as an example based on TransCAD software.

AB  - We consider a two-stage stochastic extension of the bilevel pricing model introduced by Labbé et al. (1998). In the first stage, the leader sets tariffs on a subset of arcs of a transportation network, with the aim of maximizing profits while, at the lower level, flows are assigned to cheapest paths of a multicommodity transportation network. In the second stage, the situation repeats itself under the constraint that tariffs should not differ too widely from those set at the first stage, a condition that frequently arises in practice. We analyze properties of the model, provide numerical illustrations, and open avenues for further research into this area. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Transportation network design problem (TNDP) aims to choose from among a set of alternatives (e.g., set of new arcs) which minimizes an objective (e.g., total travel time), while keeping consumption of resources (e.g., budget) within their limits. TNDP is formulated as a bilevel programming problem, which is difficult to solve on account of its combinatorial nature. Following a recent, heuristic by ant colony optimization (ACO), a hybridized ACO (HACO) has been devised and tested on the network of Sioux Falls, showing that the hybrid is more effective to solve the problem. In this paper, employing the heuristic of particle swarm optimization (PSO), an algorithm is designed to solve the TNDP. Application of the algorithm on the Sioux Falls test network shows that the performance of PSO algorithm is comparable with HACO. ?? 2011.

AB  - We study the stochastic transportation-inventory network design problem involving one supplier and multiple retailers. Each retailer faces some uncertain demand, and safety stock must be maintained to achieve suitable service levels. However, risk-pooling benefits may be achieved by allowing some retailers to serve as distribution centers for other retailers. The problem is to determine which retailers should serve as distribution centers and how to allocate the other retailers to the distribution centers. Shen et al. (2003) formulated this problem as a set-covering integer-programming model. The pricing problem that arises from the column generation algorithm gives rise to a new class of the submodular function minimization problem. In this paper, we show that by exploiting certain special structures, we can solve the general pricing problem in Shen et al. efficiently. Our approach utilizes the fact that the set of all lines in a two-dimension plane has low VC-dimension. We present computational results on several instances of sizes ranging from 40 to 500 retailers. Our solution technique can be applied to a wide range of other concave cost-minimization problems.

AB  - A two-layer transportation network design model with three
objectives is introduced. The objectives are: the minimization of the
primary path length (or traveling time) from a predetermined starting
node to a predetermined terminus node; the minimization of the total
distance traversed by the demand to reach a node on the primary path;
and the minimization of the total network construction cost. The problem
is initially formulated as an integer linear programming model. A
combinatoric solution which would be suitable for small networks because
of the large size of the subtour breaking constraints is presented. The
method produces efficient solutions according to the objectives
mentioned above. The criteria of alternate transportation facilities,
environmental concerns, and socio-economic structure are included for
these efficient solutions. By using Zeleny's ideal point approach the
best compromise solution is then selected. The results of a numerical
example are also given. Some potential applications of the model include
the planning of a new highway or rapid transportation system and the
design of an energy distribution system

AB  -  Transportation and logistics are a major sector of the economy, however data analysis in this domain has remained largely in the province of optimization. The potential of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques is largely untapped. Transportation networks are naturally represented as graphs. This paper explores the problems in mining of transportation network graphs: we hope to find how current techniques both succeed and fail on this problem, and from the failures, we hope to present new challenges for data mining. Experimental results from applying both existing graph mining and conventional data mining techniques to real transportation network data are provided, including new approaches to making these techniques applicable to the problems. Reasons why these techniques are not appropriate are discussed. We also suggest several challenging problems to precipitate research and galvanize future work in this area.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Road construction on major freeways is a primary cause of traffic incidents and delays. One approach to improve traffic mobility and safety in construction work zones is to use intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which can effectively enhance work zone traffic management through advanced surveillance and communication technologies. Although conceptually similar to a traditional advanced traffic management system, a work zone ITS has unique network and communication design requirements. The Palm Beach County, Florida, Interim Traffic Management System (ITMS) was a work zone ITS that was successfully deployed in the summer of 2003. Using Palm Beach County ITMS as an example, this paper provides technical guidelines for applying cutting-edge technologies, such as wireless communication, video compression, and Internet protocol encapsulation, in designing a work zone ITS.

AB  - This work builds further on the Orbital Transportation Network Analysis methodology proposed by the authors in earlier research. Through a review of the literature of flexibility, the different types of flexibility that can apply to an orbital transportation network, and their relationships to the system architecture, are explored. Finally a provider- side flexibility metric is defined as a combination of the different types of flexibilities. The resulting metric can then be used in addition to performance and value metrics to rank the best architectures for the orbital transportation network. It is argued that service flexibility for an orbital transportation network can be defined as the combination of three types of flexibilities, which play out in different time frames: Mix flexibility (long-term), Volume flexibility (mid-term), and emergency service flexibility (short term). Using these definitions, different architectures for an orbital transportation network were evaluated on the basis of their flexibility, value, and performance metrics.

AB  - Traditionally, the design of a transportation system has focused on one of the two sys- tems that comprise the transportation architecture, the vehicle or the network design. However, to de¯ne a systems level architecture for a transportation system, it is neces- sary to expand the system de¯nition during the design process to include the network de¯nition, the vehicle architecture, and the operations, which couple the vehicle and the network. In this paper, the transportation architecture is decomposed into these fundamen- tal sub-systems by classifying the decisions required to de¯ne each sub-system. Utilizing the integrated transportation system formulation, the design of the transportation archi- tecture can be obtained by concurrently optimizing the vehicle and network decisions. By formulating the problem in this manner, the optimization can exploit the coupling between the vehicle and network de¯nition to ¯nd a system-level solution that best satis¯es the sys- tem objective. The case study presented in this paper focuses on the design of an aircraft transportation network for overnight package delivery. By concurrently optimizing both the vehicle and network de¯nition for a selected few cities with a ¯xed demand, we obtain a minimum of a ten percent improvement in cost over that obtained by optimizing the network design using a set of pre-de¯ned aircrafts. Additionally, by comparing the concur- rently optimized solutions with the solutions obtained by traditional vehicle optimization, a minimum of an eleven percent improvement in cost is realized. The improvement in system cost obtained by the integrated transportation optimization implementation can be attributed to the reduction in operational ine±ciencies for the transportation system.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - Fluctuations in roadway capacity due to non-recurrent traffic incidents is a source of uncertainty of travel time. Travel time reliability, as a transportation performance measure, which may reflect travel time uncertainty was applied to network analysis. Recently, research which applies network reliability concepts to transportation network design has been undertaken. In this study, a continuous network design problem (CNDP) with a travel time reliability constraint was formulated as a bi-level model. A simulation-based genetic algorithm with penalty method was used to obtain the optimal capacity enhancement of each link, combined with a routine which estimates travel time reliability under fluctuations of link capacity. The effect of the travel time constraint on a CNDP was analyzed through a numerical experiment using a simple network. Additionally, the effect of budget allocation and factors to be specified in the model on the results were analyzed.

Simulating the growth of an air network is not an easy task, due to the great amount and heterogeneity of agents interacting (aircrafts, controllers and more). In this work we use a recently developed tool, called Scheduled Network, to define an algorithm to simulate such a growth; the basic assumption is that the cost for passengers should be minimized, which is approximated with the time needed to go from one airport to another one.

AB  - A bilevel optimization model for a hazardous materials transportation network design is presented which considers an emergency response teams location problem. On the upper level, the authority designs the transportation network to minimize total transportation risk. On the lower level, the carriers first choose their routes so that the total transportation cost is minimized. Then, the emergency response department locates their emergency service units so as to maximize the total weighted arc length covered. In contrast to prior studies, the uncertainty associated with transportation risk has been explicitly considered in the objective function of our mathematical model. Specifically, our research uses a complex fuzzy variable to model transportation risk. An improved artificial bee colony algorithm with priority-based encoding is also applied to search for the optimal solution to the bilevel model. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm is evaluated using a practical case and various computing attributes. © 2013 Jiuping Xu et al.

AB  - Optimal network design for transportation corridors of regional space groups is studied by using combinatorial optimization. The optimal investment model of multimodal transportation corridors is formulated by establishing supply capacity constraint and travel time constraint of transportation corridors. The unit investment cost and the length of transportation corridors is synthetically considered in the model. A method is designed by considering the characteristics of multimodal transportation corridors and the network structure of regional groups, and computational schemes are provided. The efficiency of solution is improved by using a genetic algorithm for large number of nodes. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model and the algorithm is verified through examples, which indicate that the optimal investment scheme is identified to meet transportation demands for planning and the average travel time of each transportation mode. The relationship between transportation demands and transportation corridor design is analyzed, and the results indicate that the model and the solution could be a promising approach to improving the traffic investment programs.

Our objectives are threefold—to provide a unifying view for synthesizing many network design models, to propose a unifying framework for deriving many network design algorithms, and to summarize computational experience in solving design problems. We also show that many of the most celebrated combinatorial problems that arise in transportation planning are specializations and variations of a generic design model. Consequently, the network design concepts described in this paper have great potential application in a wide range of problem settings.

Here it is presented a basic methodology to rigorously validate service quality criteria considering what might be interesting for the user. The quality analysis philosophy is the following. First, based on automatically gathered data, one reconstructs the origin–destination (OD) matrix, which contains information concerning the number of passengers traveling between zones of a certain region. The OD matrix is used to calculate some criteria characterizing the transportation network quality, such as traveling times, waiting times at a stop or transport occupation. The reconstructed OD matrix always contains errors, which cause errors in the criteria values. How significant are these errors? This question can be answered using our criteria validating methodology, which is based on statistical analysis. It has been implemented at the urban bus transport system of Porto, STCP, allowing the evaluation of the transportation network quality under a number of criteria and guaranteeing rigorous results.

AB  - To determine the optimal investments on road network of comprehensive transportation system, a bi-level programming model for continuous network design problem was employed. At the upper level problem, planner makes investment decision in links and hubs of a comprehensive transportation system to minimize the total times costs plus investment costs and the external costs such as environment pollution, land use and energy exhaustion. At the lower level, users choose their paths in accordance with deterministic user equilibrium. We design an algorithm based on extremal optimization to solve the upper level problem, in which only investments on those links and hubs with high marginal cost are updated randomly at each step to combine the merits of gradient-based methods and intelligent heuristics. Numerical comparison was made on a grid network with 9 nodes and 14 links. The result shows that the algorithm is competitive with gradient-based and simulated annealing methods.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been growing interest in working with local communities to establish marine protected areas to help conserve dwindling marine resources. Given the urgent nature of this problem, it is essential that project managers and communities learn how to best apply this approach and understand the conditions1 under which this strategy will most likely achieve success. In August 2000, and again in 2003, representatives of a number projects from across the Pacific and Southeast Asia came together in Fiji and the Philippines. Each of the projects is currently using some form of a locally-managed marine area (LMMA) strategy. The meetings were designed to allow these different projects to share and discuss their experiences in using locally-managed marine areas. From these initial meetings, representatives of some of these projects have agreed to work together and form a collaborative 'learning network' so that they can systematically share their knowledge and experiences about how to use this strategy more effectively and improve their conservation impact.2 This network is called the Locally-Managed Marine Area (LMMA) Network.

AB  - Network Design Problem (NDP) is one of the important problems in combinatorial optimization. Among the network design problems, the Multicommodity Network Design (MCND) problem has numerous applications in transportation, logistics, telecommunication, and production systems. In general, decision making in rail freight transportation has three main levels: strategic, tactical, and operational. In the field of rail freight transportation planning, MCND occurs in all levels of decision making such as car blocking, train makeup, and empty car distribution. This paper presents a review of MCND problems modeling, their applications in rail freight transportation planning, and solution methods which have been developed to solve them.

AB  - In its Resolution of 7 July 19861, the Council of the European Communities expressed its political will to implement a European programme of action against cancer. Among the priorities that it identified for attention was the need for the exchange of information and experience, particularly with regards to the preventive and early diagnosis programmes of the Member States. Such initiatives were reinforced with the establishment of the ‘Europe Against Cancer’ (EAC) programme, which included a branch of secondary prevention, i.e. systematic population-based screening for specific sites of cancer where such interventions had been judged to be effective.2 Acknowledging that some Member States were already considering a national breast screening programme, a plan was developed to enable each of the twelve Member States of the European Community to propose a pilot-screening project within its borders. The European Breast Screening Network (EBSN) thus created has now been in existence for more than a decade. The majority of its screening programmes have progressed through their implementation phases, have introduced continuing quality improvement procedures, and now have entered the phase of programme evaluation.

AB  - Complex networks provide a suitable framework to characterize air traffic. Previous works described the world air-transport network as a graph where direct flights are edges and commercial airports are vertices. In this work, we focus instead on the properties of flight delays in the US air- transportation network. We analyze flight performance data in 2010 and study the topological structure of the network as well as the aircraft rotation. The properties of flight delays, including the distribution of total delays, the dependence on the day of the week and the hour-by-hour evolution within each day, are characterized with special attention to flights accumulating delays longer than 12 hours. We find that the distributions are robust to changes in takeoff or landing operations, different moments of the year, or even different airports in the contiguous states. However, airports in remote areas (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico) can show peculiar distributions biased toward long delays. Additionally, we show that long-delayed flights have an important dependence on the destination airport. Keywords

This paper draws on an ongoing evaluation of one of the initial pilots for this initiative – the City Fringe area of London where six creative clusters are being targeted as a means of stimulating local economic development and social inclusion. Drawing on baseline research with the jewellery cluster the paper explores the degree to which this cluster gains competitive advantage from its inner city location and the extent to which it is able to contribute to the regeneration of the local area. It thus provides a critique of Porter’s theory and contributes to our understanding of the extent to which creative clusters can act as a tool for inner city regeneration.

City growth and economic output regressions are estimated using several approaches. Since only growing areas are usually designated as towns, the urban population of districts that are larger geographical areas than cities are estimated. It is found that, at the district level, manufacturing has a positive impact on city size, and proximity to large cities causes nearby cities to be larger, reflecting agglomeration effects.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific arc-elasticities. In contrast with the usual methodologies, the present methodology is not based on a statistical analysis of disaggregate data on actual modal choices and transport tariffs. This is a particularly useful feature since such data are mostly not available for freight transports in Europe. Furthermore, it fully takes into account the detailed characteristics of the network, all available routes and combinations of modes, as well as the specific localisation of activities within the network. Its estimates are compared with previously published estimates, and, in particular, with Abdelwahab's results published (1998) in this journal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Foreword : Railway stations are at the heart of the nation’s psyche. They feature in blockbuster films, romantic novels and the skylines of many towns and cities. However, they are far more important to the nation than as mere artistic reference points. Millions of people use the nation’s railway stations every day. Towns and cities have often developed around them, placing railway stations in the heart of many communities. The station can often help to provide an identity or symbol for the town or city; it can act as a point of reference as well as a civic amenity for people who want to use the station’s facilities, whether they are travelling or not. Done well, their design and operation helps to facilitate the success of the national rail network. A successful railway station will add to the passenger experience as well as support the economic, social and environmental benefits of rail. Their effective integration with other modes of transport and the surrounding area can provide for an end-to-end journey experience that makes sustainable public transport a real alternative to private vehicle usage. Given these varying demands on stations it is vitally important that they are planned, designed and improved in a manner that recognises all that they have to offer. I hope that this Guide will aid promoters, planners, architects and sponsors of station schemes to develop railway stations that maintain and enhance the legacy and contribution of stations going forward.

AB  - This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demon- strated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solvemethod is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.

AB  - This article addresses the problem of a traffic network design problem (NDP) under demand uncer- tainty. The origindestination trip matrices are taken as random variables with known probability distributions. Instead of finding optimal network design solutions for a given future scenario,we are concerned with solutions that are in some sense good for a variety of demand realiza- tions.We introduce a definition of robustness accounting for the planners required degree of robustness. We pro- pose a formulation of the robust network design problem (RNDP) and develop a methodology based on genetic al- gorithm (GA) to solve the RNDP. The proposed model generates globally near-optimal network design solutions, f, based on the planners input for robustness. The study makes two important contributions to the network design literature. First, robust network design solutions are sig- nificantly different from the deterministic NDPs and not accounting for them could potentially underestimate the network-wide impacts. Second, systematic evaluation of the performance of the model and solution algorithm is conducted on different test networks and budget levels to explore the efficacy of this approach. The results high- light the importance of accounting for robustness in trans- portation planning and the proposed approach is capable of producing high-quality solutions.

AB  - The primary objective of the research project was to develop an interactive decision tool (SNAMUTS) to assist in examining scenarios for the future growth of the Perth metropolitan area in activity centres framed around the accessibility of the transport network and the accessibility of place. The SNAMUTS tool enables the quantification of the effect of transport infrastructure improvements and modifications, and of land use intensification, on the accessibility of activity centres and corridors by different modes of transport. The SNAMUTS tool provides an in-depth examination of the potential accessibility by public transport to all centres across the metropolitan area. Accessibility is measured using an impediment variable that factors in travel time, frequency of service and transfers. In this way accessibility is measured from the perspective of a traveller who also has the choice of car travel to any location within the metropolitan area. In order to provide that choice across multiple journey purposes the inter-peak period is measured. SNAMUTS applies seven different accessibility indicators. Most measure different properties of the public transport network, including speed competitiveness with car travel; one measures the accessibility of place in terms of numbers of residents and jobs within the public transport catchment. A composite indicator for overall public transport accessibility is then compiled drawing on these indicators. A total of five future scenarios were developed to assess different assumptions for priorities in public transport service and infrastructure improvements, and (in four of these five scenarios) for the spatial distribution of urban growth in metropolitan Perth: Frequency Boost (FRB) examines the effect on network performance that can potentially be achieved in the short term by increasing service levels across the network without (or with only minor) adaptations to the physical infrastructure. Correspondingly, this scenario makes no assumptions for urban growth but is based on the same population and job numbers, and their spatial distribution, as the Status Quo scenario. The service upgrades included in the Frequency Boost scenario also form part of each subsequent scenario. • Light Rail Corridors (LRC), like the three subsequent scenarios, anticipates a growth in residents and jobs across metropolitan Perth of 42 percent to a total of 2.6 million between 2006 and 2031. It is based on accommodating all of this growth in the immediate vicinity of a network of linear activity corridors in the inner and middle suburbs anchored by a new seven-route, predominantly street-running light rail system. The focus is on corridors with existing concentrations of medium- density living and a relatively fine-grained mix of land uses. To achieve this scenario a building density roughly equivalent to R80 or a pattern of three to four- story row houses or apartments would be required, and in the CBD and some adjacent areas a building density of R160, which is generally achieved in Australian cities by mixing mid-rise (three to six-storey) development with some taller structures. Similar densities and building typologies already prevail in some of these areas. • Middle Ring Centres (MRC) selects growth nodes in the middle suburbs to accommodate all growth, and accesses these centres by a mixture of orbital rail extensions, a new two-route rapid light rail system and improvements to strategic bus corridors. Urban growth in the 19 designated activity nodes in this scenario will require an average density of 208 residents and jobs per hectare within the 800- metre radius of each centre. This is roughly equivalent to a density zoning of R160 and can be achieved by a uniform build-out of six to eight-storey apartment and office buildings, or by a mixture of low-rise (three to four storeys) and high-rise. structures. Activity nodes of such a typology and configuration can be found, for example, in Bondi Junction or Chatswood in Sydney. The Middle Ring scenario further assumes that the residential density of central Perth and central Fremantle will increase to reach a minimum density of residents and jobs of 104 per hectare. Overall however, the spatial expansion of the growth centres is quite modest on a metropolitan scale, with only 6% of the currently urbanised area affected. • Fringe Expansion (FEX) accommodates all urban growth in Greenfield areas in Perth’s outer suburbs and services these by several rail extensions and new rail routes, as well as a better connected, cross-suburban bus system. All 800-metre catchments of new train stations will be zoned and planned to accommodate about 10,000 residents and jobs each, which equates to an average density of 50 residents and jobs per hectare. Bus corridors across growth areas outside these station precincts will aim to achieve a similar density within 400 metres of the route. • Composite Wishbone (CWB) is a combination of those elements of the previous three scenarios that have the greatest positive effect on network performance. It allows for urban growth to continue simultaneously in intensification areas along new light rail corridors, designated middle-ring growth centres as well as new transit-oriented settlement areas at the urban fringe. The Composite Wishbone scenario envisions all new urban development to be public transport-oriented, including in Greenfield areas, which cater for about 20% of total growth.

AB  - Urban agglomerations exhibit complex emergent features of which Zipf's law, i.e. a power-law size distribution, and fractality may be regarded as the most prominent ones. We propose a simplistic model for the generation of city-like structures which is solely based on the assumption that growth is more likely to take place close to inhabited space. The model involves one parameter which is an exponent determining how strongly the attraction decays with the distance. In addition, the model is run iteratively so that existing clusters can grow and new ones can emerge. The model is capable of reproducing the size distribution and the fractality of the hull of the largest cluster. While the power-law distribution depends on both, the imposed exponent and the iteration, the fractality seems to be independent of the former and only depends on the latter.

Results of the experiment show that the use of SONG effectively enhanced students' learning in terms of helping students develop in-depth understanding about the development process of network patterns, and helped them develop some aspects of judgment, problem-solving, and decision-making skills. However the use of SONG may have been more effective had some other barriers to learning been overcome.

AB  - This paper considers the problem of finding a quickest path between two points in the Euclidean plane in the presence of a transportation network. A transportation network consists of a planar network where each road (edge) has an individual speed. A traveller may enter and exit the network at any point on the roads. Along any road the traveller moves with a fixed speed depending on the road, and outside the network the traveller moves at unit speed in any direction. We give an exact algorithm for the basic version of the problem: given a transportation network of total complexity n in the Euclidean plane, a source point s and a destination point t, and the quickest path between s and t. We also show how the transportation network can be preprocessed in time O(n^2 log n) into a data structure of size O(n^2) such that (1 + \epsilon)-approximate cheapest path cost queries between any two points in the plane can be answered in time O(1\epsilon^4 log n).

AB  - The word ‘ganyu’ is widely used in Malawi to describe a range of short-term rural labour relationships, the most common of which is piecework weeding or ridging on the fields of other smallholders, or on agricultural estates. Ganyu is a crucial poverty issue in Malawi because: • After own-farm production, ganyu is the most important source of livelihood for most poor households – for some it is becoming even more important than own-farm production. • Ganyu is the most important coping strategy for most poor households in the crucial hungry period between food stores running out and the next harvest. • The need to do ganyu to obtain an immediate supply of food may conflict with own-farm production and therefore, while addressing an immediate crisis, can lock some households into a vicious cycle of food insecurity. • Low ganyu wage rates mean agricultural labourers do not earn sufficient incomes to invest in sustainable livelihood development. Despite the widespread practice of ganyu, and its importance to the poor, it is an under-researched component of the jigsaw that makes up the livelihoods of rural Malawians. This is a mistake, as ganyu is too important to the poor to be sidelined – it will play a critical role in future rural development strategies and has important interactions with the current debate about developing safety nets in Malawi. The paper discusses recent literature on ganyu and opens up a debate about various future scenarios and how different strategies may affect rural labour markets.

AB  - There is an urgent need in a wide range of fields such as logistics and supply chain management to develop effective approaches to measure and/or optimally design a network system comprised of a set of units. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) researchers have been developing network DEA models to measure decision making units (DMUs) network systems. However, to our knowledge, there are no previous contributions on the DEA-type models that help DMUs optimally design their network systems. The need to design optimal systems is quite common and is sometimes necessary in practice. This research thus introduces a new type of DEA model termed the optimal system design (OSD) network DEA model to optimally design a DMUs (exogenous and endogenous) input and (endogenous and final) output portfolios in terms of profit maximization given the DMUs total available budget. The resulting optimal network design through the proposed OSD network DEA models is efficient, that is, it lies on the frontier of the corresponding production possibility set. © 2011 Operational Research Society Ltd.

AB  - Publisher Summary This chapter deals with the network design process. The network design is the ultimate product of the analysis, architecture, and design processes. This process focuses on two major areas of work for the design: evaluating vendors and service providers, along with their products and services; and diagramming the design, that is, developing detailed blueprints that provide the physical layout for all developed information. This results in a set of design decisions that are traceable back to the architecture decisions, requirements, and problem statements. The chapter describes how to trace design decisions back to architectural decisions, and how to apply metrics to design decisions. It presents an example of wide area network (WAN) architecture describing the general topology, strategic locations in the network, and locations of major types of equipment, routers, and monitoring devices. A comparison between the architecture/design of a network and that of a building is presented. The chapter also describes the key products of a network design, such as network blueprints; a component plan; vendor, vendor equipment, and service-provider selections; traceability; and metrics for measuring design success.

AB  - In the conventional transportation network design problem, travel demand is assumed to be known exactly in the future. However, there is no guarantee that the travel demand forecast would be precisely materialized under uncertainty. This is because travel demand forecast is affected by many factors such as economic growth, land use pattern, socioeconomic characteristics, etc. All these factors cannot be measured accurately, but can only be roughly estimated. Another issue in many existing transportation network design problems considers only one objective or a composite objective with a priori weights. It may be more realistic to explicitly consider multiple objectives in the transportation network design problem. We incorporate both travel demand uncertainty and multiple objectives into the transportation network design problem. It is formulated as a stochastic bi-level programming problem (SBLPP) where the upper level represents the traffic manager and the lower level represents the road users. To solve this SBLPP, a simulation-based multiobjective genetic algorithm (SMOGA) is developed. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the feasibility of SMOGA

AB  - This paper investigates geometric and algorithmic properties of the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane. In the presence of a transportation network, the distance is measured as the length of the shortest (time) path. In doing so, we introduce a needle, a generalized Voronoi site. We present an O(nm2 + m3 + nm log n) algorithm to compute the Voronoi diagram for a transportation network on the Euclidean plane, where n is the number of given sites and m is the complexity of the given transportation network. Moreover, in the case that the roads in a transportation network have only a constant number of directions and speeds, we propose two algorithms; one needs O(nm + m2 + n log n) time with O(m(n + m)) space and the other O(nm log n + m2 log m) time with O(n + m) space. © World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This study focuses on grasping the spatial changes that have taken place in a provincial city and aims to clarify the decision making processes of administrators and public transportation companies in Nagano City from a spatial point of view. Geographic studies of public transportation can be divided into two categories: those that put the emphasis on the spatial analysis of the network, and those that are descriptive accounts of the development of transportation in a community. This study attempts to clarify the spatiotemporal nodal structure, taking into account both the spatial profile and transitions over time. Metrical analysis and historical description, two previously separate methodologies, were combined to achieve this objective. Specifically, we first performed an analysis of the spatial structure of the public transportation network as it has gone through yearly changes. Then we examined how the decision making of the administrative and contracting arms has progressed in response to these changes. Finally, we looked into the influence such decisions have had on changes in public transportation. Factor analysis, based on the number of bus and railway runs flow, was used to clarify the changes in nodal structures. These results were then used to compare the convenience of public transportation in various districts in the city with consideration of the population distribution. As a result, with the exception of the central area of Nagano City where buses and railways are concentrated, the nodal structure on the whole experienced a simplification in the decade from 1990 to 2000 due to the decrease in inter-district connections. The disparity in the convenience of public transportation between the central and surrounding districts has also grown due to the deteriorating connections in surrounding districts. However, this gap was also likely subject to the influence of the Nagano Olympics and the extension of the Nagano Shinkansen in the central part of the city. Although the administration has been trying to reduce the number of areas with poor public transit access to minimize the disparity, which has increased due to the change in network spatial patterns, to date it has continued to give priority to ensuring access for citizens traveling in the central urban areas. Currently, given the fact that the number of passengers is not expected to increase, railway companies are focusing on increasing the carrying capacity and linking the rail transportation with other types of transportation in some of the busier zones. Also, bus companies are reducing and eliminating/merging some routes, while trying to maintain the existing service lines, which are still in high demand. The administration is encouraging policies to reduce poor-access areas, whereas the transportation companies are trying to improve the efficiency of the existing network, and although both are working toward improvement, differences of opinion are bound to occur because of the different strategies. In conclusion, to understand the spatial pattern change in public transportation, it is necessary not only to follow the tendencies over time but also to have a clear view of the decisions made and especially policies formed by the administration and the companies.

AB  - A cost-efficient network-on-chip is needed in a scalable many-core systems. Recent multicore processors have leveraged a ring topology and hierarchical ring can increase scalability but presents different challenges, including higher hop count and global ring bottleneck. In this work, we describe a hierarchical ring topology that we refer to as a transportation-network-inspired network-on-chip (tNoC) that leverages principles from transportation network systems. In particular, we propose a novel hybrid flow control for hierarchical ring topology to scale the topology efficiently. The flow control is hybrid in that the channels are allocated on flit granularity while the buffers are allocated on packet granularity. The hybrid flow control enables a simplified router microarchitecture (to minimize per-hop latency) as router input buffers are minimized and buffers are pushed to the edges, either at the output ports or at the hub routers that interconnect the local rings to the global ring - while still supporting virtual channels to avoid protocol deadlock. We also describe a packet-quota-system (PQS) and a separate credit network that provide congestion management, support prioritized arbitration in the network, and provide support for multiflit packets. A detailed evaluation of a 64-core CMP shows that the tNoC improves performance by up to 21% compared with a baseline, buffered hierarchical ring topology while reducing NoC energy by 51%.

AB  - A mathematical programming formulation is developed to determine the throughput of a freight transportation network. The impact of demand and capacity uncertainty on the throughput is systematically studied. Mathematical proofs are provided to show that accounting for capacity uncertainty by using a single-point expected value can lead to systematic overestimation of network throughput. This result is also valid for other measures, such as system capacity. Two sampling-based methodologies-independent random number and common random number-are provided to determine network design decisions in the presence of demand uncertainty. The sampling-based solution methods provide an approximate estimate of optimal solution and provide probabilistic bounds on the optimality gap. The presented methodologies are generic and can be applied even if different functional forms (nonlinear, nonconvex) are used to model various aspects of the freight transportation network. The numerical tests demonstrate that not accounting for capacity uncertainty can result in overestimation of system throughput of up to 40%. A common random number-based sampling strategy was found to significantly outperform the independent random number strategy for all the scenarios tested.

AB  - The continuous network design problem (CNDP) is characterized by a\nbilevel programming model, in which the upper level problem is generally\nto minimize the total system cost under limited expenditure, while at\nthe lower level the network users make choices with regard to route\nconditions following the user equilibrium principle. In this paper, the\nbilevel programming model for CNDP is transformed into a single level\nconvex programming problem by virtue of an optimal-value function tool\nand the relationship between System Optimum ( SO) and User Equilibrium\n(UE). By exploring the inherent nature of the CNDP, the optimal-value\nfunction for the lower level user equilibrium problem is proved to be\ncontinuously differentiable and its derivative in link capacity\nenhancement can be obtained efficiently by implementing user equilibrium\nassignment subroutine.

AB  - The China sustainable development is the simultaneously three key facets, including urbanism, industrialization, and information. Building a Smart Low-carbon City is an energy strategy for the sustainable development of Chinese cities. One technology way for this strategy is the City Intelligent Energy Network (CIEN), supporting a green, ecological development of the Chinese cities. CIEN starts from the redistribute of city land-use, taking small gas turbine as the major power, combining with the new energy mode, such as solar energy, wind energy and low level energy (geothermal, ice cold storage, water cold storage). CIEN could supply relatively large network and grid with electricity, heat, and cold, realizing the efficient, integrate and gradable use of the energy network technology. As CIEN is on its starting point, so this kind of technology still need the combination work with the lab research and applicable field test. Considering the city unit scale, the transportation mode, energy resources, and the traditional mode to power grid and other factors, the key point is to balance the economical use and the resource capability and adaptability. This paper tries to use the 2007 statistical data including city economy, construction, population, and different energy parameter, to establish the comprehensive model. Combining the model results, the CIEN adaptability will be discussed, and meaningful policies will be proposed, with the focusing of how to build a Smart Low-carbon city. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The overall growth and expansion of cities has been of long-standing interest to economists because of the association of urbanization and industrialization with economic growth. Relative city growth provides information on shifts in production patterns, changes in income distribution, and economic growth in a spatial context. Previous empirical work that examines relative city growth uses a Markov chain method to answer the question of how cities of different sizes grow relative to each other. Those studies find that cities of different sizes grow at similar rates, i.e., city growth is parallel. While intriguing, the treatments are inadequate in this particular context for two reasons. First, the authors do not perform statistical inference on the estimated transition matrices. Second, it fails to explain city growth dynamics. A more useful way to explain the dynamic behavior of city size is to use a time-series approach in which present size is determined by past size. This paper examines growth rates of city populations in a time-series context using Indian population data from 1901-1991. The purpose of this paper is to answer two questions regarding cities and their evolution. The first is to determine the effect of shocks on city populations in terms of the length of time for which they affect the city, i.e., to determine the non-stationarity of city population series. The second is to examine evolution of the hierarchy of cities (or relative urban growth) given the effect of time-varying shocks. Unit root tests show that city populations may be non-stationary. Cointegration of city population and total urban population suggests that the growth of cities may be parallel in the long-run. In the short-run there are deviations from the long-term parallel growth of cities due to exogenous shocks. These shocks take less than a decade to dissipate and for the city to return to its long-run growth rate. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - An optimally designed of batch-storage network that uses a periodic square wave model provides analytical lot-sizing equations for a complex supply chain network characterized as a multisupplier, multiproduct, multi-stage, nonserial, multicustomer, cyclic system, with recycling or remanufacturing. The network structure includes multiple currency flows and material flows. The processes involve multiple feedstock and product materials with fixed compositions that are highly suitable for production processes. Transportation processes that carry multiple materials of unknown composition are included in this study, and the time frame is varied from a single infinite period to multiple finite periods to accommodate non periodic parameter variations. The objective function in the optimization is chosen to minimize the difference between the opportunity costs of currency/material inventories and stockholder benefits given in the numeraire currency. Expressions for the Kuhn-Tucker conditions for the optimization problem are reduced to a multiperiod subproblem describing the average flow rates and the analytical lot-sizing equations. The multiperiod lot-sizing equations are shown to differ from their single-period counterparts. The multiperiod subproblem yields a multiperiod planning model that has many advantages over existing planning models. For example, it contains terms that represent operation frequency dependent costs. Realistically sized numerical examples that deal with multinational corporations are formulated and tested. The effects of corporate income taxes, interest rates, and exchange rates are presented. (C) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers {AIChE} J, 57: 2821-2840, 2011

AB  - Based on long-term transportation network design decisions and potential parameter variations, it is important that demand uncertainty is considered in transportation modeling. In this paper, we present a novel robustness measure that combines the two objectives by minimizing the expected travel time while bounding the relative regret in each scenario facing uncertain origin-destination demand (OD demand). The concept of ??-robust solution is introduced into the transportation network design problem. We propose a robust transportation network design model with regret value constraints, then design an algorithm based on the genetic algorithm to solve the problem and obtain the optimal solutions for different regret values. Finally, numerical results based on the Nguyen-Dupuis network validate the effectiveness of the algorithm. While detailed analysis on trade-offs, between the expected travel time and the maximum regret value, shows that large reductions in maximum regret do not necessarily result in a great increase in expected travel time. Meanwhile, we compared the robust model presented with the stochastic model and numerical examples demonstrate that the robust planning network is more reliable and less risky than the stochastic model if demand uncertainty is considered in modeling. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.

AB  - The goals of this paper are to present criteria, that allow to a priori quantify the attack stability of real world correlated networks of finite size and to check how these criteria correspond to analytic results available for infinite uncorrelated networks. As a case study, we consider public transportation networks (PTN) of several major cities of the world. To analyze their resilience against attacks, either the network nodes or edges are removed in specific sequences (attack scenarios). During each scenario the size S(c) of the largest remaining network component is observed as function of the removed share c of nodes or edges. To quantify the PTN stability with respect to different attack scenarios we use the area below the curve described by S(c) for c ∈ [0, 1] recently introduced (Schneider, C. M. et al. [PNAS 108 (2011) 3838]) as a numerical measure of network robustness. This measure captures the network reaction over the whole attack sequence. We present results of the analysis of PTN stability against node and link-targeted attacks.

AB  - The issue of planning for adequate capacity in transportation systems to accommodate growing traffic demand is becoming a serious problem. Recent research has introduced "capacity reliability" as a new network performance index. Capacity reliability is defined as the probability that a network can accommodate a certain volume of traffic demand at a required service level given variable arc capacities, while accounting for drivers' route choice behavior. Previous papers on this topic provide a comprehensive methodology for assessing capacity reliability along with extensive simulation results. However, an important issue that remains is what type of route choice model should be used to model driver behavior in estimating network capacity reliability. Three different route choice models (one deterministic and two stochastic models) are compared, and the effect of using each of these models on estimating network capacity reliability is examined.

AB  - The path length and number of turns are the major factors in path planning of transportation and navigation systems. Shortest path planning has been widely studied in the literatures. Most researches only take the issue of shortest distance into account, and the impact of turns are rarely mentioned, that is, the shortest path may not be the fastest. Considering both two factors in a path-searching algorithm is NP-complete. This paper proposes two algorithms: the least-turn path algorithm and the minimum-cost path algorithm to balance both the path length and turns. The proposed algorithms adapt Lee's rectilinear routing algorithm to find a least-turn path with turn penalty on a mesh-connected network. In addition, Kirby's concept and a modified Dijkstra's algorithm are also introduced for the proposed minimum-cost path algorithm, which considers the turn penalty and the length factor on a transportation network. The time complexities for both algorithms are O(N), where N is the number of nodes on a mesh-connected network or the intersections on a transportation network.

AB  - As urbanization increases and new business models for transportation and mobility arise, the design of transportation networks should no longer be done in a vacuum. Design interactions between multiple networks have largely been analyzed either as non-cooperative games with non-unique Nash equilibria, even if assumptions needed for such games are not satisfied, or using knowledge-based or agent-based methods that cannot explicitly quantify network sensitivities. A new framework is proposed to model network design in the presence of coexisting networks using multiobjective optimization in a novel manner to identify symbiotic relationships. The framework does not require strict assumptions about availability of information or timing of decisions, and it can be used to examine network sensitivities that knowledge-based methods cannot. A bundled discount pricing problem and subsidy problem are derived from the symbiotic relationships. The framework is applied to formulate a symbiotic bike-sharing network design problem in the presence of a coexisting transit system as a departure-time-elastic multicommodity flow problem. A small network example demonstrates the potential dependency between transit systems and bike-sharing systems for the first time, and the existence of an optimal discount value for considering bundled fares. A larger bike-sharing network, BIXI, is examined in the presence of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in downtown Toronto to address the question of subsidy. It is found that BIXI is operating in a relatively transit-friendly state, and subsidy by TTC to maintain a status quo in Toronto may be worth considering if the cost of subsidy is less than a conservative average reduction achieved of 2.43 units of transit-only user cost for every 1 unit increase of bike-sharing cost. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The ability to make optimal transportation network investments decision is central to the strategic management of transportation systems. The presence of uncertainty in transportation systems presents new challenges in making optimal network investment decisions. In this paper, we develop a multi time period network design problem considering both demand uncertainty and demand elasticity. Such an approach affords the planner the flexibility to delay, change, or even abandon the future network investment. We measure the flexibility of investing over multiple time periods as compared to a single-stage network design decision. Initially, we provide a taxonomy and define many dimensions of transportation network flexibility. This is followed with the development of a flexible network design formulation (FNDP), in which the investment is staged over multiple time periods. The demand is assumed to be separable and the demand elasticity is captured using a negative exponential distribution. We develop the FNDP formulation as bilevel stochastic mathematical programming with complementarity constraints (STOCH-MPEC) in which the bi-level formulation is converted to a single level using non-linear complementarity constraints conditions for user equilibrium (UE) problem. The formulation is implemented on two test networks and the results show the benefits of FNDP over single-stage NDP-measured in terms of increase in present expected system consumer surplus (PESCS)-are in the range of 10-30%. The results clearly demonstrate that under demand uncertainty there are potential benefits of introducing flexibility in investment decisions. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of FNDP with different budget values and it is observed that certain paradoxical sharp corners are observed at certain budget values. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This computational problem is at the heart of solution methods to a variety of dynamic network models that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications. The design, implementation, and computational testing are reported for parallel algorithms that exploit possibilities offered by low-cost, commonly available, parallel, and distributed computing platforms to solve many-to-many shortest path problems in time-dependent networks. Five shared-memory implementations and five message-passing implementations are developed. The parallel implementations adopt three decomposition strategies based on the sets of destination nodes, origin nodes, and departure times at origin nodes. The algorithms are coded with two types of parallel computing environments: a message-passing environment based on the parallel virtual machine library and a multithreading environment based on the Sun Microsystems Multi-Threads library. Numerical results are obtained with large-sized dynamic networks and two types of parallel computing platforms: a distributed network of Unix workstations and a Sun shared-memory machine containing eight processors. Satisfactory speedups of sequential algorithms are achieved. Numerical results obtained indicate that, overall, shared-memory platforms appear to be the most appropriate type of parallel computing platforms to solve dynamic shortest path problems that arise in the context of intelligent transportation systems applications.

AB  - The problem of finding the most cost efficient network design by considering two or more demand matrices that represent varying network traffic over several time periods, is referred to as multi-hour net- work design. Capacity installations need to be determined such that the network is robust enough to allow routing of the demand matrices non-simultaneously. In the paper the multi-hour network design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and the solution approach is based on a branch-and-cut framework that incorporates several classes of valid inequalities. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effect of problem reduction on computing times. Results from domination theory are applied to reduce the number of non-simultaneous traffic demand matrices to a so-called dominant (sub-)set. That is, matrices from the original data set are removed which do not change the solution space of a feasible network. In addi- tion, strategies for strengthening the right-hand side of metric inequalities are presented and computational results are provided based on measurements from an operational network.

AB  - Cargo shipments are subject to hijack, theft, or tampering. Furthermore, cargo shipments are at risk of being used to transport contraband, potentially resulting in fines to shippers. The Transportation Security Sensor Network (TSSN), which is based on open software systems and service-oriented architecture principles, has been developed to mitigate these risks. Using commercial off-the-shelf hardware, the TSSN can detect and report events that are relevant to appropriate decision makers. However, field testing is required to validate the system architecture and to determine if the system can provide timely event notification. Field experiments were conducted to assess the TSSN's suitability to monitor rail-borne cargo. Log files were collected from these experiments and were postprocessed. We present the TSSN architecture and results of field experiments, including the time taken to report events using the TSSN and the interaction between various components of the TSSN. These results show that the TSSN architecture can be used to monitor rail-borne cargo.

AB  - When evaluating the earthquake risk to transportation system it is important to take into account the integrated effect of ground motion, liquefaction, and landslides on the network components and system. In this article, the risk from earthquakes to a transportation system is evaluated in terms of direct loss from damage to bridges and travel delays in the transportation network. The contribution of site effects to the loss from damage to bridges is estimated using the San Francisco Bay area as a test bed. Damage and loss to bridges from ground shaking and ground displacements (vertical and horizontal) from liquefaction and landslides are computed for a magnitude 7.0 scenario earthquake on the Hayward fault in California. It is found that liquefaction damage is the largest contributor to the repair cost which is used as a measure of the loss from damage. The performance of the transportation network is evaluated in terms of travel delay times. Travel delays resulting from damage due to ground shaking and changes in travel times are evaluated for the scenario event under the assumptions of fixed and variable travel demands. It is found that with fixed travel demand, the post-event travel times increase significantly. Travel times remain relatively unchanged and decrease with the variable demand time assumption.

AB  - Summary form only given. Reusability of tests is crucial for
reducing total design time. This raises the problem of test knowledge
transfer, physical test application and test scheduling. We present a
formulation of the embedded core-based system-on-chip (SOC) test
scheduling problem (ECTSP) as a network transportation problem. The
problem is NP-hard and we present a O(mn(m+2n)) 2-approximation
algorithm using the result of the single source unsplittable flow
problem (U<sub>FP</sub>). We have implemented a Test Planner Tool TFLOW
with the Common Lisp language using the U<sub>FP</sub> algorithm given
by Dinitz et al. (1999)

AB  - Using two comprehensive datasets on populations of cities and metropolitan areas for a large set of countries, I present three new empirical facts about the evolution of city growth. First, the distribution of cities' growth rates is skewed to the right in most countries and decades. Second, within a country, the average rank of each decade's fastest-growing cities tends to rise over time. Finally, this rank increases faster in periods of rapid growth in urban population. These facts can be interpreted as evidence in favor of the hypothesis that historically, urban agglomerations have followed a sequential growth pattern: Within a country, the initially largest city is the first to grow rapidly for some years. At some point, the growth rate of this city slows down and the second-largest city then becomes the fastest-growing one. Eventually, the third-largest city starts growing fast as the two largest cities slow down, and so on. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spatial equity is an extremely important issue in both design of a new\nand redesign of an existing transit (and highway) network because it is\nconcerned with the benefit distribution among transit (and highway)\nnetwork users. This paper presents a hi-level optimization model-in\nwhich the spatial equity issue is explicitly considered for the first\ntime-for solving the public transportation network redesign problem\n(PTNRP). The goal of the upper-level subprogram is to minimize total\ncost, including user cost, operator cost, and unsatisfied demand cost,\nfor the studied bus transit network, subject to a variety of resource-\nand policy-related constraints. The lower-level subprogram is a user\nself-routing optimization problem in which all transit users try to find\nthe transit route to minimize their own travel cost (or time) and number\nof transfers in the network. Then, a procedure for a genetic\nalgorithm-based solution is developed to solve this PTNRP hi-level\noptimization model. Network experiments are conducted, and numerical\nresults are described. Future research directions are also given.

AB  - In this work we consider the following hazmat transportation network design problem. A given set of hazmat shipments has to be shipped over a road transportation network in order to transport a given amount of hazardous materials from specific origin points to specific destination points, and we assume there are regional and local government authorities that want to regulate the hazmat transportations by imposing restrictions on the amount of hazmat traffic over the network links. In particular, the regional authority aims to minimize the total transport risk induced over the entire region in which the transportation network is embedded, while local authorities want the risk over their local jurisdictions to be the lowest possible, forcing the regional authority to assure also risk equity. We provide a linear bilevel programming formulation for this hazmat transportation network design problem that takes into account both total risk minimization and risk equity. We transform the bilevel model into a single-level mixed integer linear program by replacing the second level (follower) problem by its KKT conditions and by linearizing the complementary constraints, and then we solve the MIP problem with a commercial optimization solver. The optimal solution may not be stable, and we provide an approach for testing its stability and for evaluating the range of its solution values when it is not stable. Moreover, since the bilevel model is difficult to be solved optimally and its optimal solution may not be stable, we provide a heuristic algorithm for the bilevel model able to always find a stable solution. The proposed bilevel model and heuristic algorithm are experimented on real scenarios of an Italian regional network. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In transportation engineering, the network design problem (NDP) aims at\nfinding an optimal link improvement in a network for given demand.\nAlthough traffic demand is essentially uncertain, many previous studies\nassumed it to be deterministic. The demand stochasticity is incorporated\nand formulas are developed for system-optimal (SO) flow stochastic NDP.\nThe SO assumption is justified by comparing results from SO\ndeterministic NDP with those of user-equilibrium NDP. The difference in\nsocial cost between the two approaches is found to be less than 5%. Two\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with recourse formulations are proposed:\none with penalty function and the other without. The main advantage of\nthe first formulation is that a planner can exert better control on\nimprovement by appropriately weighing reduction in the congestion versus\nimprovement costs. The challenge, however, lies in selecting an\nappropriate penalty function. A nonlinear penalty function is found\nsuitable for the test network studied. The second formulation does not\nrequire penalty function but results in a large number of scenarios.\nNonanticipativity constraints are introduced in the second formulation\nto arrive at uniform improvement over all scenarios. Both formulations\nare solved on a test network. It is found that necessary improvements\nand the total costs with both models are more than those for average\ndemand.

AB  - Previous approaches used to solve the transit route network design problem (TRNDP) can be classified into three categories: 1) Practical guidelines and ad hoc procedures; 2) Analytical optimization models for idealized situations; and 3) Meta-heuristic approaches for more practical problems. When the TRNDP is solved for a network of realistic size in which many parameters need to be determined, it is a combinatorial and NP-hard problem in nature and several sources of non-linearities and non- convexities involved preclude guaranteed globally optimal solution algorithms. As a result, the meta-heuristic approaches, which are able to pursue reasonably good local (possibly global) optimal solutions and deal with simultaneous design of the transit route network and determination of its associated service frequencies, become necessary. The objective of this research is to systematically study the optimal TRNDP using hybrid heuristic algorithms at the distribution node level without aggregating the travel demand zones into a single node. A multi-objective nonlinear mixed integer model is formulated for the TRNDP. The proposed solution framework consists of three main components: an Initial Candidate Route Set Generation Procedure (ICRSGP) that generates all feasible routes incorporating practical bus transit industry guidelines; a Network Analysis Procedure (NAP) that determines transit trips for the TRNDP with variable demand, assigns these transit trips, determines service frequencies and computes performance measures; and a Heuristic Search Procedure (HSP) that guides the search techniques. Five heuristic algorithms, including the genetic algorithm, local search, simulated annealing, random search and tabu search, are employed as the solution methods for finding an optimal set of routes from the huge solution space. For the TRNDP with small network, the exhaustive search method is also used as a benchmark to examine the efficiency and measure the quality of the solutions obtained by using these heuristic algorithms. Several C++ program codes are developed to implement these algorithms for the TRNDP both with fixed and variable transit demand. Comprehensive experimental networks are used and successfully tested. Sensitivity analyses for each algorithm are conducted and model comparisons are performed. Numerical results are presented and the multi-objective decision making nature of the TRNDP is explored. Related characteristics underlying the TRNDP are identified, inherent tradeoffs are described and the redesign of the existing transit network is also discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to set up a growth model for a world city, in order to determine the roles of government and enterprises. With the model, the authors of this paper want to test the efficiencies between governmental and enterprise investment for the experience of Beijing. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proves the contributions of enterprise and governmental investment for a world city by three assumptions. It then sets up a growth model for a world city by taking the variable of governmental investment instead of the labor variable in the Solow Growth Model. With C-D function, the paper sets up an empirical growth model of the world city of Beijing by ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. Findings - Results of OLS show that the elasticity of enterprises operating surplus to world city growth is bigger than the one of governmental expenditure to world city growth, which indicates that the investment ability of the private sector has more efficient effectiveness on a world city than governmental investment. Meanwhile, technological progress also has weak effectiveness for world city growth from the regression of C-D function. Practical implications - When the public and private sectors were taken into account for world city growth, the role of government investment is constructing a fair environment for enterprises' competition and encouraging innovation in the private sector, as well as enhancing efficient policy for innovation application in the private sector. Originality/value - The paper sets up a growth model with the variables of private and public factors taking the place of the variable of labor in the Solow Growth Model with government investment. The model can be adopted to explain the dynamics of world city growth in a transition economy.

AB  - The rapid growth of international container handling in recent years has led to an increased utilization of mega-containerships and the rebuild of container network. In this paper, we focus on the optimization of total cost for regional containers transportation network system of seaports, and propose a new reliable intelligent algorithm, named Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). ACO is to solve the nonlinear NP-complete problems, which is greatly inspired from real ants and their food seeking behavior. The paper constructs an optimization model for certain containers transportation network system and simulates the whole process. The results show the improved ACO Algorithm is of a credible and excellent probability accumulation searching method to reduce the integrated cost of container transportation network obviously. The optimization model that we constructed provides a reference model for containers transportation network layout.

AB  - In connection with the network realization problem the main questions of the algorithm are which edges to choose and what is the budget consequence of that. These problems can be solved by exact optimization methods, but in this case the number of computational steps (additions and comparisons) is an exponential function of the number of nodes. For this reason usually heuristic methods are chosen for solving these problems. Some special problems can be formulated as maximal flow problems. To get the solution we use only maximal flow and shortest route algorithms. Thus we decrease the number of computations, but the size of the network will grow. In this paper, we describe this algorithm to solve the network realization problem. Then we give a transportation network realization problem and show how to solve this problem by the some algorithms.

AB  - A study was done to formulate and solve the multiobjective network design problem with uncertain demand. Various samples of demand are realized for optimal improvements in the network while the objectives of the expected total system travel time and the higher moment for total system travel time are minimized. A formulation is proposed for multiobjective robust network design, and a solution methodology is developed on the basis of a revised fast and elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. The developed methodology has been tested on the Nguyen-Dupuis network, and various Pareto optimal solutions are compared with earlier work on the single-objective robust network design problem. A real medium-size network was solved to prove efficacy of the model. The results show better solutions for the multiobjective robust network design problem with relatively less computational effort.

AB  - Phylogenetic methods for the analysis of species data are widely used in evolutionary studies. However, preliminary data transformations and data reduction procedures (such as a size-correction and principal components analysis, PCA) are often performed without first correcting for nonindependence among the observations for species. In the present short comment and attached R and MATLAB code, I provide an overview of statistically correct procedures for phylogenetic size-correction and PCA. I also show that ignoring phylogeny in preliminary transformations can result in significantly elevated variance and type I error in our statistical estimators, even if subsequent analysis of the transformed data is performed using phylogenetic methods. This means that ignoring phylogeny during preliminary data transformations can possibly lead to spurious results in phylogenetic statistical analyses of species data.
