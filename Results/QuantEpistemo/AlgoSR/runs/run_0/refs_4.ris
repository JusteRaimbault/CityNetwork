AB  - The complexity of the modern firm is one of the defining features of the global economy. This study examines one dimension in which this complexity can be observed, the corporate subsidiary. Here we investigate where the headquarters of the largest subsidiaries are located in the United States, where subsidiary growth is occurring, and how the United States compared with Canada from 1996 to 2004. The results show that U.S. parent and subsidiary headquarters have different metropolitan distributions, and that 1996-2004 parent and subsidiary growth patterns were also distinct. New York saw its parent headquarters community grow, while its subsidiary headquarters community exhibited the sharpest decline of any U.S. metropolitan area. This spatial behavior was the opposite of what occurred in Canada, where Toronto dominated in subsidiary growth while experiencing one of the largest parent headquarters declines among Canadian metropolitan areas. Our study interprets these results and calls for further research to pursue the questions raised here. Copyright © 2009 by Bellwether Publishing, Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An explosion of multi-lane roundabout projects has recently occurred in Central Ohio. This paper discusses four transportation improvement studies for which multiple multi-lane roundabouts were chosen as the preferred solution. The projects include: 1) a high volume partial cloverleaf interchange design that will include high-capacity roundabouts at the ramp terminal intersections and other intersections within the corridor; 2) a six-mile extension of a suburban/rural four-lane principal arterial that will include six roundabouts along it's length; 3) two closely spaced, high capacity, roundabouts in a densely developed area, near two schools, 4) roundabouts utilized for access improvements in a future office/commercial growth corridor. This paper includes a description of these projects and a discussion of how the choice of multi-lane roundabouts in Transportation planning decisions at these locations will reduce delay and vehicle emissions and air pollution while also improving safety, aesthetics, and access management. The analysis presented in this paper is highly abbreviated. Please contact the author for additional information or greater detail of the analysis.

AB  - Interest in comparative urbanism has increased in recent years. Scholarly discus- sions, however, have tended to focus on theorizing comparative urbanism rather than engaging in comparative research, with little attention paid to the lives of urban residents. This article engages in these discussions, entering from the perspective of a geographer who conducts comparative urban research. The focus is on a recently completed project, Youth and the City, and reflects on the nature of the project, its methodology, and the comparative analysis that emerged from it. The highlighting of young people’s experiences of urban life in three cities—Lusaka, Recife, and Hanoi—illustrates that how the urban is experienced depends on who you are and the spaces you negotiate. Whose urban is being focused on greatly affects the nature of the comparisons being undertaken, and needs to be incorporated into debates on comparative urbanism.

AB  - Four urban ecological design and planning research areas are identified: (1) application of ecosystem services, (2) adaptation of settlements for natural disasters, (3) ecological renewal of degraded urban places, and (4) ability of people to link knowledge to action to affect positive change. Ecosystem services are the benefits humans derive from nature, which, until relatively recently, were not normally valued by traditional economics or, when acknowledged, were regarded as externalities. Through the identification of economic and cultural benefits of ecosystems, higher standards for landscape performance can be established. As our climate continues to change, the number of natural disasters increases, frequently with catastrophic consequences for human settlements. Designers and planners must learn how to develop adaptive strategies to climate change and mitigation strategies for the consequences that result. Most cities include underused, degraded places that are ripe for creative redevelopment. Urban ecology provides a conceptual framework that recognizes the restorative potential of people. However, although knowledge about our environments abounds, we seem limited in our ability to adopt measures necessary to ensure a healthy planet for future generations. Each research area offers prospects for landscape and urban planning. Both planning perspectives are essential because the population continues to grow and people are increasingly living in urban and suburban places. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Transit oriented development (TOD) presents a sustainable urban development strategy by creating an efficient integration of land use and public transit. A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - We are witnessing a rebirth of physical design, both in practice and the academy, spurred on by neo-traditional community planning and neo-urbanism. This article attributes the sources of contemporary regional design to this renaissance. It also traces its origins to classic regional planning, which has been a professional activity for over a century. Regional design shapes the physical form of regions. It takes a regional perspective in guiding the arrangement of human settlements in communities. It is a strategy to accommodate growth by providing a physical framework to determine or guide the most beneficial location, function, scale, and inter-relationships of communities within a region. This strategic function of regional design distinguishes it from urban and regional planning, apart from its focus on physical form. Communities, the links among them, and their environs are the three key physical components of regions that are the objects of regional design. Regional design strives to connect these communities by transport, communication, and other links into regional networks. Keeping the fringes or environs of the communities relatively sparsely settled is another aim. The article presents historic and contemporary examples of regional design in the US and Europe, and outlines principles for regional design. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The presented study aimed at identifying and assessing public preferences for variations in tree species composition, tree height structure, and presence of dead trees left for natural decay—forest characteristics which are likely to be affected when subjecting stands to nature-based forest management in the temperate, nemoral deciduous zone. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire and by applying choice experiments to elicit people's willingness to pay (WTP). Respondents evaluated a set of hand-drawn forest profile diagrams designed to illustrate different levels and combinations of the mentioned three forest characteristics. The highest WTP (1939 DKK, approx. €262) was found for a scenario of replacing the baseline case stand of even-aged conifers with no dead trees left for natural decay with a mixture of conifers and broadleaves of varying heights, and leaving a few dead trees for natural decay (5 ha−1). However, as the study did not include the importance of variation at forest and landscape levels for public preferences, the elicited WTP ought to be interpreted and used carefully. Based on the study's findings, further research on recreational values associated with conversion to nature-based forest management is suggested.

AB  - Communicative rationality offers a new paradigm for transportation planning. Drawing on the literature and lessons from transportation planning practice, this paper describes the characteristics of a ” communicative” form of transportation planning and compares them with conventional practices. A communicative rationality paradigm would place language and discourse at the core of transportation planning. The paper argues that it would lead to greater attention to desired transportation ends (goals), better integration of means and ends, new forms of participation and learning, and enhanced deliberative capacity. The paper explains the implications of this paradigm for the role of the transportation planner, the purpose of planning, the planning process, communicative practices, problem framing, and the nature of planning analysis. The paper concludes with an assessment of communicative rationality's ability to promote more effective transportation planning. It seeks to create a dialogue that will support the investigation of new transportation planning processes.

AB  - Two factors - sprawl and race - are shaping urban America. Through annexation or city-county consolidation, "elastic cities" capture new suburban development. Elastic cities have growing populations. stronger tax bases, and better fiscal health than growth-constrained "inelastic cities." However. the concentration of low-income minorities, which is greatest in inelastic cities, is the basis for major disparities between cities and many surrounding suburbs. Even highly inelastic cities in "White America" maintain virtual economic parity with their suburbs. For many central cities, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, annexation and city-consolidation are no longer legally or politically feasible. Allied with older, declining suburbs, cities must form new political alliances to get the federal government and, in particular, state governments to change the "rules of the game" regarding regional development. Key policy reforms are regional land use planning and growth management laws, regional tax base or revenue sharing, and regional "fair share" affordable housing laws.

AB  - More than half of the planet's residents now live in urban areas. In the foreseeable future, global urbanization will continue. China is one of the most rapidly urbanizing countries in the world, and during the past three decades its urban expansion has encroached on productive lands and caused myriad environmental problems. To achieve urban sustainability, Chinese cities need to be better designed, planned, and managed in a more ecological and sustainable way. In this study, we focused on Shenzhen City in southern China, which has experienced extremely rapid urbanization and socioeconomic transformations since China's economic reform and open-door policy enacted in 1978. We have proposed a methodology for environmental resource accounting, which consists of ecosystem services, atmospheric environment capacity, water environment resource, and land value. Our methodology recognizes the strategic significance for conserving biodiversity and maintaining high environmental quality. In particular, protecting the remaining natural and semi-natural areas in and around the city - ecological core areas - is of paramount importance. In addition to valuating urban environmental resources and services, we have also proposed an ecological network-based urban landscape design in order to improve urban sustainability for the city. Our proposed urban design plan has been taken seriously by the city government. Overall, this study provides a quantitative approach for research and practice in urban sustainability, and should be of value to other rapidly urbanizing regions around the world. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The relationships of these 45 detailed temperature patterns with 12 land-use types and 10 surface materials over the entire city and adjacent rural areas show that the land-use types most frequently associated with temperature patterns are residential, commercial (including the CBD) and undeveloped. Among the surface materials, surface asphalt, asphaltic roofing and water are related most often to temperatures. Several of these findings corroborate many results of previous urban numerical simulation modeling analyses.

AB  - The world has seen a significant rise in the number of conflicts and an intensification of their impacts, over the last few decades. UN-HABITAT has responded swiftly and effectively to these situations, whether in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia or Sudan. One of the key areas of UN-HABITAT intervention and assistance has been institutional development and capac- ity-building in post-conflict situations, where conflict is often characterized by a breakdown of governance institutions and anarchy in human settlements reconstruction and redevelopment. UN-HABITAT has played a key role in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, in restoring urban gov- ernance practices and introducing new local development planning process. UN-HABITAT has been engaged with the central and local governments in the Western Balkans through several interventions, most of them focusing on strengthening processes of participa- tory governance. The Urban Planning and Management Programme (UPMF) in Kosovo was a path-breaking intervention where UN-HABITAT worked closely with both central and local institutions to support the development of new policy and legislation relating to urban and spatial planning; to enhance local capacity for good governance and inclusive planning; and to strengthen local institutions with support from experts and professionals from across the world. UPMF is still being applied at the time of publication to train municipal and urban plan- ners in inclusive, strategic and action-oriented planning practices. Globally planning is in a state of flux and is reinventing itself to incorporate many of the charac- teristics mentioned above. Traditionally, urban planning has been seen as a means to control and regulate the development of towns and cities. In the cities of the developing world as well as in the post-conflict and post-disaster context, however, these traditional planning approach- es have failed to address the challenges of rapid urbanization and the poverty, exclusion, informality and vulnerability which it brings in its wake. At the third session of the World Urban Forum held in Vancouver 2006, discussions on a renewed role for planning in ensuring sus- tainable urbanization generated enormous interest. Several events brought to the fore several innovative cases and examples of how things are changing. UPMF is another example. It was also highlighted, however, that there is still a lot to be done, in order to change the practice of planning across the world, especially in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore an important and unique role which community participation and involvement can play in a revised transportation plan- ning process. A review of diverse views about community participation, as well as a critique of the current urban transportation planning process, reveals that the former has played, primarily, ad hoc opportunistic and diverse roles, and that the latter is in desperate need for dynamic, subjective, "impact" information - required to assess attractive transportation systems. The contributions of several disciplines - eco- nomics, operations research, management science, political science, public administra- tion, and others - are reviewed to assist in the development of a conceptual frame- work for a new community participation role, as a provider of key information to the planning process. An eclectic, experimental approach is recommended to explore the possibilities further.

AB  - Urban planning as the preparation of plans for, and regulation and management of, neighbourhoods, localities, towns, cities, and metropolitan regions involves attempts to organize social and economic relations in space through different scales of government and [`]governance'. It therefore also deals with the political and social consequences of delineating spatial boundaries and influencing spatial allocations of development and resources: all of these aspects of planning activity have consequences for its possible spatial, social, and economic outcomes. However, in seeking to understand planning and assess its positive and negative effects, by and large, planning theory per se has tended to focus on normative theories of planning processes, typically and somewhat unproblematically, positioning planning as a potential arena for forms of participatory democracy. In contrast, research into urban issues from geographical perspectives bears more directly on critical examinations of the limitations of, and positive potentials for, planning's processes and normative aspirations. Geography's concerns with the interconnections of space, place, power, subjects and identities pay closer attention to the aims and effects of planning practice and regulation in the creation of place, and on discursive and material struggles in specific localities.

This case study of one such productive valley reveals its agricultural uniqueness to Mexico and the pressures for its industrialization. Landscape and regional planning and environmental impact assessment tools were applied to suggest compatible and sustainable uses. Five environmental units were selected according to a digital model of the terrain and the overlapping of ecological maps, aerial photos and Landsat images. Descriptions included both natural and transformed physical attributes. Cultural and landscape architecture parameters were added to evaluate the aesthetics of each unit. Contrasting six potential land-uses (agriculture, agri-industry, tourism-recreation, urban, range management for cattle, and conservation) generated the capacity for sustained land-use, together with an environmental impact assessment. Economic means for directing land-use toward sustainability are to be developed by the local government. Community organization, local political pressure and the tastes of the national government will dictate its future use.

AB  - Integrated Transportation Planning is a concept which suggests that a detailed package of environmental, social, economic and political tools is necessary to ensure the safe accessibility and mobility of people who wish to travel from one place to another. The notion of integrated transportation planning has steadily progressed over the years.  It began with traditional transport planning, oriented toward automobile traffic engineering, then progressed to "multi-modal planning" to include public transit modes.  It later broadened to include pedestrians, cycling, small vehicles and variable land use, and now extends furthermore to considerations of full environmental and cost impacts. Integrated transportation planning applies to rapidly urbanizing areas in growing economies and implies also that any environmental impacts should be minimized through comprehensive planning and implementation.  Integrated transportation planning includes a number of elements with the principal ones being: Enhanced Accessibility and Mobility for all, Environmental Sustainability, Participatory Planning, Transportation Demand Management, Transportation Systems Management, Comprehensive Land Use Planning, and Least Cost Optimization.  In a climate where traffic congestion, often unbearable air pollution, and ever dwindling energy supplies are becoming a major problem the world over, this paper considers blending specific elements to better achieve environmental and energy sustainability and to better serve the needs of people who wish to travel without impediment.

AB  - Following the riots of 2005, many commentators were drawn to a comparison of Paris’s “problem areas” with the U.S. urban ghetto. But are the poor suburbs of Paris truly akin to the Black ghetto of Chicago, the quintessential American city of sociological lore? Urban Outcasts makes a powerful case against the efficacy of the comparison. In so doing, however, the role of federal housing and highway policies is probably overstated relative to the War on Drugs, the South Side of Chicago may not be the epitome of the American ghetto that it perhaps once was, and the French banlieues may be more troubled by unemployment and social marginalization than this book makes them appear. Ghettos, then—like slums more generally—may not be all alike. But why they are not alike should be subject to considerable debate. This book provides a lively starting point.

AB  - Despite the unprecedented rate of urbanization around the world, information regarding land use planning and management is not updated frequently enough to accurately track this urban change. In order to monitor changes in the urban environment, an understanding of the change in patterns of urban development over time is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study is to explore an approach for combining remote sensing and spatial metrics to monitor urbanization, and investigate the relationship between urbanization and urban land use plans. The study areas, consisting of the cities of Hanoi, Hartford, Nagoya and Shanghai, were examined using Landsat and ASTER data from 1975 to 2003. In this study a program based on the PLADJ spatial metric was undertaken to produce urban growth maps. Then, FRAGSTATS was used to evaluate the characteristics of urban composition. The results showed that the urban core of Nagoya changed moderately over time. Shanghai had a high population density, and satellite towns absorbed potential suburban development. Hartford exhibited a spread out pattern of urban development with a high concentration of settlement in the suburb. Conversely, the new urban areas of Hanoi developed rapidly along major transportation routes, resulting in urban development in Hanoi assuming an unusual pattern. The combined approach of remote sensing and spatial metrics provides local city planners with valuable information that can be used to better understand the impacts of urban planning policies in urban areas, particularly in Hanoi. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper compares the discourse and practices of purportedly collaborative or "partnership" approaches to urban governance in the United States and United Kingdom, as enacted through nationally-directed planning and revitalization programs. The language and underlying principles used to justify and advance such participation initiatives are similar, but differences in state structure in these two national contexts differentiate how and to what effect the engagement of local citizens actually occurs. Governance partnerships are one example of a growing array of policies privileging the local scale, and this "new localism" is commanding attention by U.S. and U.K. urban geographers working a variety of research contexts. Such study of the practices and impacts of a new localism is critically important in an urban geography research agenda, in light of concerns about how ongoing political and economic restructuring affects empowerment and inequity within and between urban areas and among social groups in the city.

AB  - Temperature changes generated by the urban landscape influence people's health and comfort as well as energy consumption and air quality. It is therefore important for urban planning purposes to learn about air temperature variations between different land use categories for both extreme situations and during average conditions. Air temperature data were collected at 18 sites within the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, over an 18-month period. These data, together with land use information from the Master Plan of Gothenburg, have been used in a statistical analysis of air temperature variations and land use. A characterisation of three built-up land use categories (urban dense, multi-family and single houses) was performed as well as an analysis of observed temperature differences between these categories during both day and night and different weather conditions. At night the built-up areas were always warmer with the highest temperature deviation (8°C) during clear conditions in the urban dense category. The 'multi-family' and 'single houses' categories, however, showed a similar temperature difference, around 4°C, compared to the outskirts. On clear days built-up categories were colder than areas outside the city, a phenomenon referred to as a cool island. On cloudy days these areas were usually warmer, around 2.5°C. Air temperature thus varies within the built-up area on a diurnal basis and during different weather situations but what is the relevance of these results for urban planning? How can this information change the way we plan? The consequences of air temperature variations on human comfort and energy consumption are discussed. Human comfort is measured as physiological equivalent temperature (PET), an index that expresses thermal stress on people. It is shown that PET values are generally higher within the densely built-up category but the energy demand is lower. In fact due to local climate variations a household within the densely built-up category uses 11-20% less energy on a yearly basis compared to a suburban one. This paper presents information that is of concern for the urban plan and the authors hope that it will increase awareness of climate variations in urban areas. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper explores the use of Virtual Environment (VE) technology in urban planning. The case we select is that of public engagement with the process of government, which in its traditional form suffers from several limitations. A 3D cityscape environment has been implemented, where people can observe planning changes, access information, and comment on proposed designs. Our research focuses on the mechanisms of interaction inside this environment. We propose that VE technology will facilitate and improve useful engagement by the public in the planning processes, unlike the traditional consultation process. In order to test our hypothesis, we have built a VE city model. Early results have shown that the model was suitable for general public use, in terms of technological availability and usability. This paper presents results of experiments undertaken with the general public and urban planning professionals to judge their motivation in using this technology as a way to facilitate public consultation in the planning changes.

AB  - Urban planning and decision-making for sustainable development urgently need data of high spatial resolution to establish the relationship between the socio-economic performance of the urban system and its different sub-units (i.e. housing schemes, commercial and industrial developments, services) on the one hand and their environmental impacts of these sub-units on the other. To achieve this task, a system was developed to delineate urban land cover units. The approach was tested for the city of Munich. The units delineate the fine-grained pattern of urban built-up and open spaces. The typology was based on established categories of zoning and development plans. In addition, the units were delineated on an aggregated scale to generate a synoptic understanding of the urban 'metabolism' for different 'strategic' levels of urban planning. A case study on urban hydrology is presented to characterize aspects of the metabolism of the urban system. Additional case studies covered urban climates, energy demand for space heating and carbon dioxide emissions. Results showed that the cover units and types had distinct environmental features. Furthermore the causal links with urban physical and land use features were investigated. Based on the hydrological case study, environmental targets and standards to promote sustainable development are proposed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Across the globe, governments, business and communities are seeing an ever-increasing frequency of extreme weather-related events. These events are playing out against a backdrop of global population growth and urbanization, leading to a complex knot of interrelated pressures. In emerging and established cities alike, these trends are changing the spatial pattern of risk and radically altering perceptions of whether a city is ‘safe’ or ‘well prepared’. Cities have a tremendous challenge to maintain social well-being and economic vitality in the face of these complex, uncertain and constantly changing risks.

AB  - This paper shows that robustness analysis is a technique with a potential for aiding decision makers in choosing transportation investment projects. In this paper, it has been demonstrated that it can be successfully used in urban transportation planning in conjunction with urban travel demand software. The robustness analysis procedure emphasizes the need, under conditions of uncertainty, to make early decisions in a time-phased sequence, while preserving future options that currently seem attractive. The results of the robustness analysis from the case study used in this paper indicate that the method is simple to understand, easy to use, minimizes future surprises in terms of expected future events not happening, and provides the flexibility required in typical urban planning problems where decision making is needed to be taken under conditions of uncertainty. A general framework to be used in such cases is proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This is an introductory course in urban transportation planning that examines the evolution of urban transportation systems in the United States, with particular emphasis on the complex relationships between transportation, land use, and urban form. The content of the course is divided into four parts. The first is a historical look at the planning and development of transportation systems and urban form in the U.S. The second part looks more conceptually and theoretically at the relationships between land use and transportation. The third part examines a number of land use and transportation policy questions facing planners today. And the fourth part explores the normative perspectives and values shaping our views of cities and their transportation systems.

AB  - Urban land-use planning and management are in constant mutation throughout the world. With sustainability as the goal, the use of indicators for land auditing and monitoring is becoming more and more in demand. Classical approaches elaborate core sets of indicators by picking the most relevant elements in exhaustive lists. More recently, a few structured research approaches consider the set of indicators as a whole, following the concepts of systernics, and so highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the sets. Starting from the principle that the relevance of an indicator is due not only to its intrinsic qualities, but also to its placement and relationships with the other indicators in the collection, this paper proposes a systemic method, named Relational Indicatorset Model (RIM), for the elaboration of a set of indicators for management support. The RIM method starts with the a priori definitions of the goals and users' purpose (RIM-objectives), and then chooses indicators to reflect the objectives on representing the distribution of indicators in a relational graph (RIM graph). The graph modeling allows analyzing the match between the indicatorset and the defined objectives, as well as the interrelationships between the indicators. The analysis is made easier by breaking down the RIM graph following two projections: the first one (RIM-4D) highlights the distribution of the indicators in a multidimensional graph with respect to the objectives; the second one (RIM-IR) focuses on the interrelationships and offers the possibility of formalizing the causal interactions and the aggregational relationships between the indicators, following a qualitative approach. The RIM is applied to the design of sets of spatial and non-spatial indicators for the cities of Thies (Senegal) and of Geneva (Switzerland) to emphasize the potential of the method. It opens up interesting possibilities for application to all sets of indicators for sustainable land-use development. It also contributes to the creation of observatories for city management, instruments used to monitor and control the urban sustainable development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper argues that before 1978, the Chinese state, a "police state" in the Foucauldian concept of governmentality, aimed at total administration of the economy and society. Central investments determined local spatial development. Economic reforms and administrative decentralization after 1978 allowed local authorities to pursue their own development, leading to many planning problems. To regain control over spatial development, the state now employs urban system planning to regulate development in city regions. The Pearl River Delta Urban System Plan (PRDUSP) is a case in point. To overcome myopic regional development and environmental issues, the PRDUSP lays out a development strategy in which cities are organized into hierarchies around three metropolitan areas, have different functions, and are connected by development and growth axes. Various measures and policies also are recommended. All these suggest that the Provincial Government of Guangdong is searching for a new way of regional governance.

The empirical component begins with a contemporary (potential) racial flashpoint as a catalyst for unpacking the city’s urban morphological transformations since the late 18th century. The Lexington case illustrates the importance of particular understandings of urban sociospatial form as key in shaping racialized landscapes in general. It also contributes to a richer understanding of Southern city form and development, and ultimately holds forth the possibilities for intervening in urban sociospatial processes through the cultural landscape to chal- lenge the always-reformulating processes of racial formation.

AB  - This chapter discusses current urban land use (in terms of form, size, and shape of cities and urban areas) against a global background. The specifi cs of urban land use (surface characteristics, dynamics of change, and impacts on the environment) are examined using different conceptual approaches (e.g., ecosystem services, risk, and governance aspects). Although urban land use is a special case (i.e., small in scale, yet dominant in infl uence), a range of commonalities exist between urban and nonurban land use. A discussion on shrinking cities underlines that there are more pathways to urban land (-use) development than growth. The current extent and rates of urbanization force us to rethink land connectivity, competition, and decision making, and the resulting knowledge can be used to generate a new concept of land use. The connections and implications of urban land-use patterns need to be examined on a global scale, as local-scale patterns may be affected by global-scale outcomes and vice versa.

It explores the societal context of land use planning and proposes a model for understanding and reconciling the divergent priorities among competing stakeholders; it explains how to build planning support systems to assess future conditions, evaluate policy choices, create visions, and compare scenarios; and it sets forth a methodology for creating plans that will influence future land use change. Discussions new to the fifth edition include how to incorporate the three Es of sustainable development (economy, environment, and equity) into sustainable communities, methods for including livability objectives and techniques, the integration of transportation and land use, the use of digital media in planning support systems, and collective urban design based on analysis and public participation.

AB  - Neoliberal governance has recently come to dominate U.S. and U.K. cities. This discussion explores an important idea that British and American urban geographers now grapple with: contingent urban neoliberalism. Four new understandings about these formations in U.S. and U.K. cities are discussed: they exist in historically and geographically specific forms, they are always complex cultural projects, they are enabled by production and use of space, and they are not end states but evolving processes. I suggest that this political project is anything but a “top-down” brute and desensitized imposition on cities. I believe it is best conceptualized as a series of differentiated, keenly negotiating, processural, and space-mobilizing constructions in new political and economic times. These governances, in general principal, are outgrowths of new economic times and circumstances. But they are constituted and reconstituted through the vagaries of the situated social hierarchies, political cultures, economic bases, and cultural under- standings that create a patchwork of wildly varying governances.

AB  - In 1993, Jane Jacobs noted that the burgeoning of qualitative approaches to the city evoked 'a methodologically diverse terrain, tenuously drawn together by a reliance on the hermeneutic interpretative process. There are the more familiar, although often marginalized, methods associated with ethnography (such as the in depth interview and participant observation). But increasingly qualitative research includes discursive and representational analyses . . . (Jacobs, 1993: 827). A decade on, these approaches have become mainstream as a 'new' urban geography has embraced and to some extent distanced itself from the interpretative turn (Lees, 2002). Despite the salience of issues of method and methodology and the cultural turn, I find these little discussed in much of the 'new' urban geography that I read these days. In much of the 'new' urban geography, method and methodology are for the most part inconveniences in the world of 'have theory will travel'. By method I mean actual data collection and analysis, and by methodology I mean the bedrock views on the nature of 'reality' (ontology) and knowledge (epistemology) on which methods are founded (Hoggart et al., 2002: 1, 310). 'New' urban geographers are 'users' of qualitative methods, but they seldom outline how they have used these methods or their relationship to the theoretical tracts that they follow. In other instances, they make a case for method and methodology but do not then follow this through in their research and writings. It is in this context that we should perhaps praise quantitative urban geography or urban sociology for its more explicit discussion of methods and data collection. Particularly for students trying to come to terms with the practicalities of 'doing' an urban geography research project this reticence is a real problem....

AB  - In the United States, we have failed to control urban sprawl. Ultimately the pattern of urban growth is dictated bya complex interaction of place-specific factors in individual communities. These factors include geography, history, lifestyle, politics, and economics. This paper documents the conflict between development and slow-growth interests in the San Bernardino-Redlands area of southern California. Research presented focuses on the history and viability of agriculture, the origin of and forces behind the slow-growth movement, and the economic and social impact of growth-limiting policies. The conflict between developers and slow-growth proponents in Redlands demonstrates the inability of current land-use planning to deal effectively with a number of serious problems, including urban sprawl, the protection of valuable agricultural resources, and the provision of adequate and reasonably priced housing.

The gated community phenomenon has not been researched in West African cities, and the extent of these communities' formation and convergence or divergence with global trends is unknown. This article provides the first-ever analysis of their formation in Greater Accra, Ghana. The analysis suggests that the globalization of real estate markets and Diaspora living are important aspects in the residential geography of Accra. The concept of "transnational houses" is employed to explain aspects of the local property market that are being globalized and differentiated from local housing. Transnational houses add another layer of diversity to the contemporary urban geography of Greater Accra.

AB  - Nearly half a century has passed since Lynch described visual quality of American cities. Although the issue of visual impact assessment in urban planning is not new, only few experiences exist considering visual aspect when realizing new development zones. Visual as- pects are fundamental in urban planning, since each plan choice can generate manipulation or obstruction of urban elements, producing negative effects on the image of the city. Viewshed analysis can help to achieve a more objective and consequently more effective analysis of vis- ual impacts. Traditional viewshed analyses (single, multiple and cumulative) do not show which target is visible from a certain cell. On this purpose, a new viewshed analysis has been developed, the Identifying Viewshed, which shows how many and which objects are visible in several areas. The implemented extension has been tested in three different contexts, Lauren- zana and Venosa, in Basilicata Region, and Pisa, in Tuscany.

AB  - Although the concept of â€˜land use planningâ€™ is now firmly enmeshed in American urban planning, its meaning still remains vague. This paper aims to clarify the meaning by examining the historical development of land use planning in the USA. At the beginning of the twentieth century, city planners viewed a city as an organic unit of public facilities. While city planning thereafter provided potential elements of land use planning, such as zoning, zoning surveys and land use classification systems, the idea of land use planning itself was actually derived from rural county planning and was initially utilized in urban county planning as a guide for zoning in the 1930s. After bringing about a change in the way cities were viewed, that is, as a pattern of land use and population density, land use planning was further employed as a guide for urban redevelopment policies in the 1940s, and finally reaching full integration into city planning in the 1950s and 1960s.

AB  - Theories of place have yet to be developed to explore societal responses to terrorism in the post-9/11 city. Urban geographers have shown the relevance of place for understanding the way people live in cities, including conceptualizations of the way people perceive those places. Geographers working on environmental risk have also conceptualized perception, but only in regard to hazard perception. They have not focused on the city itself as a hazard site, nor have they studied how the contours of place affect hazard perception. Joining urban geography and risk-hazards scholarship, this study argues for a terrorism-place nexus that links terrorism hazard perception to urban place. Using survey and interview data collected from 79 financial service executives in New York City, it will be shown that terrorism has created a place-based ontological dissonance among financial executives, and we speculate about the implications for the city should these workers restore ontological order by moving away their establishments.

AB  - Vulnerability resulting from debt is part and parcel of the risk society and a salient characteristic of current neoliberal times under financialized global capitalism. Rising indebted- ness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stabil- ity of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebted- ness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigra- tion, racialization, and/or greying. This article examines the spatial distribution of household debt in Canadian cities at multiple scales of analysis. It analyzes how levels of household debt relate to a number of key socio-demographic and housing variables from the census, including those related to changes occurring over the 2000s. It simultaneously models the geography of debt at the metropolitan and neighborhood scales using multi-level hierarchical linear modeling methods, and in doing so, it identifies some key drivers and correlates of household debt and the scales at which they operate. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the empirical find- ings for understanding the role of the emerging urban debtscape in the restructuring of the social geography of the city.

AB  - Greenways provide much-needed natural corridors and environments in urban and suburban areas, along with recreational, transportation and nature education opportunities for urban residents. However, there is a tension between the natural environment and public use in urban areas. Local residents' concerns for safety through clear sightlines and the use of lighting along trails may compromise the ecological integrity and natural character of urban greenways, whereas natural corridors in the city are often considered as being potentially unsafe, and therefore essentially inaccessible to use by many residents, particularly women, children, aging people and those with disabilities. As a result, the planning and development of safe urban trails within natural greenways can be challenging and contentious. Prospect and refuge theory provides a theoretical framework for understanding the human ecological dimensions of environmental design. Within this framework, a growing body of environment-behavior research provides useful principles for planning and designing greenways that are both ‘green’ and safe. These principles include: visibility of others, visibility by others, choice and control, solitude without isolation, and environmental awareness and legibility. This paper outlines the ‘safe communities’ approach developed in the city of Toronto, Canada, and applies it to the planning and design of trails in urban greenway systems through a series of planning guidelines, with particular reference to the Greater Toronto Area experience. The paper concludes that only when public safety is paramount will the necessary community support be built which will allow the successful integration of natural greenways into the fabric of metropolitan areas.

AB  - Urban metabolism considers a city as a system with flows of energy and material between it and the environment. Recent advances in bio-physical sciences provide methods and models to estimate local scale energy, water, carbon and pollutant fluxes. However, good communication is required to provide this new knowledge and its implications to endusers (such as urban planners, architects and engineers). The FP7 project BRIDGE (sustainaBle uRban plannIng Decision support accountinG for urban mEtabolism) aimed to address this gap by illustrating the advantages of considering these issues in urban planning. The BRIDGE Decision Support System (DSS) aids the evaluation of the sustainability of urban planning interventions. The Multi Criteria Analysis approach adopted provides a method to cope with the complexity of urban metabolism. In consultation with targeted end-users, objectives were defined in relation to the interactions between the environmental elements (fluxes of energy, water, carbon and pollutants) and socioeconomic components (investment costs, housing, employment, etc.) of urban sustainability. The tool was tested in five case study cities: Helsinki, Athens, London, Florence and Gliwice; and sub-models were evaluated using flux data selected. This overview of the BRIDGE project covers the methods and tools used to measure and model the physical flows, the selected set of sustainability indicators, the methodological framework for evaluating urban planning alternatives and the resulting DSS prototype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article describes a series of collaborative land use planning workshops for a peat-meadow polder in the Netherlands. Three interconnected planning workshops were conducted with stakeholders: a design, analysis and negotiation workshop. Stakeholders were invited to work together and carry out planning tasks using spatial decision support tools implemented in an interactive instrument (the 'Touch table'). Goals, participants, tasks and tools were different for each workshop. The series began with a design workshop, in which stakeholders used drawing tools on the Touch table in order to transfer and process local knowledge. Next, in an analysis workshop, stakeholders used spatial multicriteria tools to combine different types of expert knowledge and generate feedback for quantitatively evaluating land use scenarios for the polder. The series ended with a negotiation workshop, where stakeholders used interactive land use allocation tools collectively on the Touch table to reach a consensus land use plan for the polder. Results from surveys conducted at the end of each workshop indicated that participants found the tools appropriate for a workshop setting. It is concluded that digital maps can be used effectively to support three different types of collaborative planning workshops that are a part of an ongoing land use planning process. Important aspects in the design of the workshops included the selection of participants, level of detail and complexity of spatial information provided and a balanced formulation of workshop assignments.

AB  - Urban areas are faced with distinctive, or 'systemic', issues arising from their unique social, environmental and economic characteristics. Examples include an altered energy exchange and hydrology which contribute to the urban heat island and an enhanced surface runoff; due, in part, to an altered surface cover, with more built and fewer vegetated surfaces. Landscape planning needs to protect urban ecosystem services and to enable this, an urban characterisation which is meaningful for these properties is useful. This paper presents such a characterisation for Greater Manchester which uses urban morphology type mapping and surface cover analysis. The results show that residential areas cover almost half of the 'urbanised' area of Greater Manchester, with medium density residential accounting for 37%. It is within this category, which represents the urban matrix, that 32% of all the evapotranspiring (i.e. vegetated and water) surfaces are found. This will include private gardens and street trees which are often not represented by traditional mapping approaches. The methodology presented here is potentially useful for strategic urban planning in relation to climate change adaptation and for green infrastructure planning in particular. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To effectively integrate nature conservation into sustainable landscape management, it is essential to deepen the understanding of why, what, where and for whom nature is protected. This is especially important for nature conservation in human dominated landscapes such as cities, where built up and protected areas are moving closer to each other due to worldwide urbanization. In this study we ana- lyzed historical and current data in Sweden to examine how decision makers have used the nature conservation objectives stated by law to establish urban and rural nature protected areas respectively. The focal conservation objectives are the preservation of biodiversity (species and habitats), outdoor recreation and restoration of environments. How these objectives were used was analyzed for all 1869 nature reserves in southern Sweden in relation to degree of urbanization in the landscape. We found that nature reserves in more urbanized landscapes were based on a higher number of objectives and had a different composition of objectives compared to rural reserves. The objectives “outdoor recreation” and “species biodiversity preservation” were more common in urban reserves, while preservation of habitats were more common in rural. From the last decades we found indications of a shift in use of objectives in urban areas, going from outdoor recreation to a stronger focus on species diversity conservation. National and global trends in the nature conservation debate were also reflected in the use of objectives over time. ©

AB  - The rapid urbanization of land in the peri-urban West District surrounding Zanzibar city in Tanzania has occurred during a 20-year period of political and economic reform, with related reforms in the land sector. Utilizing 2006 and 2007 interviews with officials and residents alongside document and archival research, this study examines two themes in relation to Zanzibar's most prominent program of contemporary land reform, a Finnish-funded project for the Sustainable Management of Lands and Environment (SMOLE). These themes entail: (1) the importance of the historical-cultural geography of peri-urban land dynamics for dual reform (simultaneous political and economic reform) processes in Africa; and (2) the critique of pro-poor, neoliberal land reform for the disjunctures between its rhetoric, actual planning practice, and the beliefs and practices of the peri-urban poor, wherein we discover a lack of participation, transparency, or democracy in the land sector. The article's broader aim is to contribute a detailed African case study to urban political ecology's efforts to argue for democratization of the construction of social environments.

Urban planning should include esthetics in formulations of land use plans, transportation systems, and public or community facilities plans. Housing in the land use plan should have special consideration as to the inspiring location and outlook in selecting residential areas. Transportation routes and terminals should be given more esthetic input as the transportation plan is consummated. The community facilities plan should especially include the esthetic quality of parks and open space. Elimination of the unesthetic by setting standards for esthetics are recommended to be programmed annually to reduce in preplanned percentages air, noise, and water pollution, solid waste, substandard housing and other blight through urban renewal, and, on the positive side, to enhance esthetics by adding to the city landscaping, underground electrical distribution, cultural facilities.

AB  - "Music and Urban Geography" is the first book to theorize musical aspects of\nthe tremendous changes that have overtaken major cities in the developed world\nover the past few decades. Drawing on musicology, music theory, urban\ngeography, and historical materialism, Krims maps changes not only in how\nmusic represents cities, but also in how music sounds and is deployed socially\nin new urban contexts. Taking on venerable musicological debates from entirely\nnew perspectives, Krims argues that the cultural-studies approach now\npredominant in cultural musicology fails to address contemporary realities of\nproduction and consumption; instead, the social effects of space and new\npatterns of urban production play a shaping role, in which music takes on new\nforms and functions, with representation playing a significant but not always\ndecisive role.

AB  - Research in transportation, urban design, and planning has examined associations between physical environment variables and individuals' walking and cycling for transport. Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.

AB  - Today, for the first time in the history of Humankind urban dwellers outnumber rural residents. Urban places, towns and cities, are of fundamental importance - for the distribution of population within countries; in the organisation of economic production, distribution and exchange; in the structuring of social reproduction and cultural life; and in the allocation and exercise of power. Furthermore, in the course of the present century the number of urban dwellers and level of global urbanisation are destined to increase. Even those living beyond the administrative or functional boundaries of a town or city will have their lifestyle influenced to some degree by a nearby, or even distant, city. The analysis of towns and cities is a central element of all social sciences including geography, which offers a particular perspective on and insight into the urban condition. The principal goal of this third edition of the book remains that of providing instructors and students of the contemporary city with a comprehensive introduction to the expanding field of urban studies. The structure of the first two editions is maintained, with minor amendments. Each of the thirty chapters has been revised to incorporate recent developments in the field. All of the popular study aids are retained; the glossary has been expanded; and chapter references and notes updated to reflect the latest research. This third edition also provides new and expanded discussion of key themes and debates including detailed consideration of metacities, boomburgs, public space, urban sprawl, balanced communities, urban economic restructuring, poverty and financial exclusion, the right to the city, urban policy, reverse migration , and traffic and transport problems. The book is divided into six main parts. Part one outlines the field of urban geography and explains the importance of a global perspective. Part two explores the growth of cities from the earliest times to the present day and examines the urban geography of the major world regions. Part three considers the dynamics of urban structure and land use change in Western cities. Part four focuses on economy, society and politics in the Western city. In part five attention turns to the urban geography of the Third World, where many of the countries experiencing highest rates or urban growth are least well equipped to respond to the economic, social, political and environmental challenge. Finally part six affords a prospective on the future of cities and cities of the future. New to this edition are: further readings based on the latest research; updated data and statistics; an expanded glossary; new key concepts; additional study questions; and a listing of useful websites. The book provides a comprehensive interpretation of the urban geography of the contemporary world. Written in a clear and readable style, lavishly illustrated with more than 80 photographs, 180 figures, 100 tables and over 200 boxed studies and with a plethora of study aids Urban Geography: A Global Perspective represents the ultimate resource for students of urban geography.

AB  - Around the world, many urban districts and some entire cities are dominated by vacant and abandoned property. Former uses of these properties range from heavy industry to residential neighborhoods, and each bears many potential legacies of past uses, including: introduction of contaminants that may threaten the health of humans and other species, engineering of land and infrastructure that may undermine hydrological ecosystem services, and introduction of species including invasives. While the ecological functions that characterize vacant urban lands have been only partially investigated, the legacies associated with their past uses are known to affect ecosystem services. In addition, changed industries, weakened economies, arcane financial systems, population migration, and aging resident populations have left many people living in the midst of this vacancy, with clear implications for human health and safety. Since market demand is weak in highly vacant districts, social capital may be particularly important to protecting quality of life and ecosystem services. New design and planning approaches should be informed by urban ecological knowledge that is synthesized with social and cultural understanding of residents' perceptions and values. Interest in urban agriculture, green infrastructure, and open space planning for vacant urban lands is burgeoning. However, without adequate knowledge of highly vacant districts as socio-ecological systems, design and planning may have unintended consequences for human health, water quality, adaptation to climate change, and a panoply of other ecosystem services. Research questions and design and planning applications require a transdisciplinary approach to address highly vacant urban districts with legitimacy and relevance. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Emerging research on comparative neoliberalism at the urban scale seeks to trace its diffusions and document its contours and trajectories in regions beyond the trans-Atlantic corridor. Discovering geographical variation in neoliberal policy should produce more incisive understandings of neoliberalism's creative transformations, yet the emergent research on comparative urban policy may route uncomfortably close to the world of world and global cites. This brief discussion considers expanding places of inquiry to non-growth economic contexts and complex urban conditions in the world of cities . It introduces contemporary conditions of urban political economy in the People's Republic of China, where neoliberalization works in the interests of the party-state and resists critical analysis in association with debates over strains of neoconservatism (neoauthoritarism, neosocialism, and statism) in the Chinese academy and their mutual imbrication in an array of complex issues.

AB  - The Year 2000 edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) will contain several new chapters providing guidance to planners on how the HCM can be used in transportation planning models. This paper describes a new speed-flow curve recommended by the new HCM for use in planning models and illustrates the application of this new speed-flow curve in the San Francisco Bay Area. This new speed-flow curve is called the “Akçelik ” curve. Previous research by Dowling, Singh and Cheng demonstrated that the Akçelik speedflow model produces significantly more accurate speed estimates than the standard Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) equation traditionally used in planning models. As has been shown in the wealth of speed-flow data gathered for freeways and other facilities, the Akçelik speed-flow curve is relatively insensitive to increases in traffic volumes until volumes approach capacity. Then the speeds predicted by the Akçelik curve drop fairly rapidly (at the rate predicted by queueing theory). The Akçelik predicted speeds however do not go as low as those predicted by the standard BPR curve for extreme volume/capacity ratios (greater than 2.00 v/c). This is because the Akçelik curve has the property of maintaining a linear increase in link travel times for v/c ratios greater than 1.00. This linear increase in travel times for v/c ratios greater than 1.00 is also in accordance with queueing theory and has been born out in simulation model results. This paper shows a specific application of the Akçelik curve to the San Francisco Bay Area. It was found that the Akçelik curve did not adversely affect equilibrium assignment model run times. The computation times were similar for both the Akçelik and a variation of the BPR currently used by MTC. The Akçelik curve however resulted in a significant (and the authors believe more realistic) lowering of the estimated mean systemwide speed by 3 to 6 mph ( 5 to 10 km/h). The Akçelik curve also results in more realistic assigned traffic volumes that tend to cluster more closely around a v/c ratio of 1.00 with much fewer links with v/c ratios in excess of 1.5 than obtained with traditional BPR curves and their variants.

AB  - Benchmarking of rail firms has become a matter of substantial interest and many authors have emphasised the importance of transaction costs in regard to assessing the desirability of vertical separation. However, due to data and methodological limitations, previous rail efficiency studies have been unable to explicitly analyse the role that transaction cost measures play in determining the relative efficiency performance of different rail firms or rail systems. This paper incorporates recently produced measures of transaction costs into a two-stage bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA), applied to a sample of 43 Swedish, German and British train operating firms. In the first stage, the number of transaction staff is included as a separate (physical) input within the DEA. This is followed by a second-step Tobit regression which seeks to evaluate the impact of institutional (vertical separation and type of operation), environmental (competition) and transactional (monetary values of transaction costs) factors on technical efficiency. The results of the analysis show that transactional factors are more important in determining technical efficiency than institutional factors and the opening-up of competition.

AB  - This paper traces the development of urban transportation planning in the United States, focusing particularly on the influence that three previous conferences - Sagamore (1958), Hershey (1962), and Williamsburg (1965) - have had on the course of this development. Included also are comments on the current state of the art of urban transportation planning and observations as to its future direction. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1934, which authorized the use of "1 Y2 percent funds" for highway planning is identified as the progenitor of urban transportation planning in the U.S., and two reports based on information developed by the highway planning surveys first funded under the 1934 Act, "Toll Roads and Free Roads" (I 939) and "Interregional Highways" (1944), are credited with preparing the ground for much of the urban transportation planning that was to follow. The rapid development of home interview survey techniques in the late 1940's and the full-scale introduction of computer technology in the Detroit Area Transporta- tion Study are noted, as is the work of the National Committee on Urban Transporta- tion, which was initiated in 1954 under sponsorship of the Automotive Safety Foundation. In addition to its substantial technical contributions, the NCUT, through its success in mobilizing the cooperative efforts of virtually every major group concerned with urban transportation, stimulated significant gains in Federal-State-local relationships and paved the way for increased Federal aid to cities in solving their local transportation problems.The impact of the 1956 and 1962 Federal-Aid Highway Acts on urban transpor- tation planning is assessed. The substantial contributions, of the Hartford, Sagamore, Hershey, and Williamsburg conferences are discussed, as are their shortcomings. It is noted that many of our present concerns - environmental impacts, relationships between transportation and land use, need for cooperation among all levels of government, the multi-modal nature of urban transportation, and the need for citizen involvement, to name a few - were incorporated in the provisions of either one or another of the Federal-Aid statutes in the 1950's and '60's or appear in the recommen- dations of the several conferences. That these matters still concern us today is given as evidence that planning has not fully lived up to its promise and responsibility, that more rather than less planning is needed, and that, above all, new leadership to pick up where the old has left off must soon assert itself.

AB  - Sea-level rise poses major challenges to coastal land uses, and therefore to urban planning processes. In theory, if done well, urban planning can lead to responses to sea-level rise that are socially and environmentally sustainable. In practice, urban planning processes may fall short of this ideal. We use multiple methods to describe and analyse how urban planning processes have led to adaptation to sea-level rise in Lakes Entrance in Victoria, Australia. Adaptation has principally taken the form of restrictions on development on low-lying land. In this town, which is considered particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise, the urban planning process and its outcomes have been controversial and divisive. Policies at the state level were imposed rapidly on this particular local community, and were later applied across the state. Our findings support the emerging consensus that to be sustainable, urban planning needs to: facilitate local ownership of adaptation responses; build collective action within local communities and between local communities and different arms and levels of government; and be fair in its application across space and over time. Addressing these social, dimensions of adaptation takes time, but they are a sine qua non of sustainable adaptation to sea-level, rise. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed at identifying passive design features through extensive literature study that can be incorporated in residential buildings to make them energy efficient. The study also aimed at identifying changes in the design process that can affect energy efficiency in residential buildings. It has analyzed the design features of typical residential buildings representative of upper middle income households in Dhaka through a case study conducted in Dhaka. It also analyzed the present electric energy use for cooling and lighting typical residential buildings of upper middle income households in Dhaka and the possible energy savings by adopting certain energy efficient features in the case study building. It also distinguishes the different roles of developers, architects, interior designers, land owners (clients) and residents that can act as a barrier in achieving energy efficiency in residential buildings. The findings from this study indicate that doubling the thickness of external walls on east and west, use of hollow clay tiles instead of weathering course for roofs and use of appropriate horizontal overhang ratios for all four orientations can reduce the cooling load of the case study building by 64% and hence reduce the total energy use of the building by 26%. Finally it can be concluded that the process of designing energy efficient residential buildings is not a ‘one-man’s show’. Architects, developers, interior designers and clients are the other actors who can bring a change in the design practice.

AB  - The authors present an integrated GIS tool, Accessibility Analyst, for accessibility analysis in urban transportation planning, built as an extension to the desktop GIS software package, ArcView. Accessibility Analyst incorporates a number of accessibility measures, ranging from catchment profile analysis to cumulative-opportunity measures, gravity-type measures, and utility-based measures, contains several travel-impedance measurement tools for estimating the travel distance, time, or cost by multiple travel modes along actual travel routes, and interoperates with GIS data-management and data-integration, spatial-analysis, network-analysis, surface-modelling, and spatial-visualisation functions. Undertaking accessibility analysis with use of Accessibility Analyst allows the user to take full advantage of a GIS to produce spatial distributions of accessibility over a region. It can be applied to a wide range of issues in urban transportation planning, such as for studies on the relationship between transportation and land use, evaluation of transportation network efficiency, transportation infrastructure planning, and for impact assessments relating to transportation policies.

AB  - Economic, political, cultural, and environmental distinctiveness may attract highquality workers and firms as well as reflect a region's export viability. We hypothesize that local consumption activity can be a source of such distinctiveness and thus of long-term growth and stability, and that specialization does not reflect export activity alone. Using skewness across metropolitan regions in the United States as a distinctiveness measure, we show that some occupations are more lopsided in their distribution than others. Because some highly skewed occupations like health care support workers and artists, media, entertainment, and sports workers are known to be chiefly local-serving; their regional significance can be attributed to variations in residents' local consumption spending rather than export demand. We conclude that economic development practitioners should weigh the considerable investments, including subsidies and tax incentives, made in wooing and retaining presumptive export base activities against those that might target distinctive local consumption activities.

AB  - The carbon dioxide balance for the Municipality of Florence (102.3km2), with 29.1km2 of green space within the built-up city and 46.6km2 in the semi-rural peri-urban area, shows that collectively the green spaces offset 6.2% of the direct carbon emissions. However the green spaces in the densely built-up city only offset 1.1% of the emissions. 13.5ktCO2y-1 are taken up by vegetation in the built-up areas and 58.7ktCO2y-1 by vegetation in the peri-urban area. Urban green spaces are most efficient in offsetting anthropogenic CO2 emissions during the period March to June when plant growth rates are high and emission rates are relatively low. Landscape fragmentation is highly positively correlated with total CO2 emissions and negatively correlated with CO2 uptake. The detailed information produced during this investigation shows that policies aimed at reducing CO2 emissions in winter months will have a greater overall effect on total CO2 release to the atmosphere than those aimed at increasing CO2 uptake. Nevertheless, urban designers should consider all the benefits of urban green spaces and seek to ensure that new suburban development conserves green spaces and aims at sustainable urban design. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Nigeria, a nation with population of more than 88 million has about 30% of its population living in urban areas. This proportion of the population in urban settlements has great implication on land-use planning and environmental quality. This is where it is desirable to examine the level of urban landscape planning in the country as this can give us an insight into the degree of land-use coordination and environmental quality in different parts of the country. The execution of landscape planning is under physical planning sectors of the various government agencies. This makes it unclear to identify the agencies responsible for landscape planning. The consequence of this is that there is no comprehensive approach to landscape planning. What is now being experienced is a piece-meal approach, under the supervision of landscape-related professionals such as architects, town planners, horticulturists, and engineers, amongst others. Also, the existing situation leads to conflicting policies and implementation procedure. This paper discusses the conceptual framework for landscape studies, drawing conclusions to justify the method adopted in the study of urban landscape planning experience in Nigeria. There are also specific socio-economic, political, legal and administrative constraints facing landscape planning in the country. Nigerian landscape planning development history can be categorized into three periods, namely - pre-colonial period dating before 1854, colonial period from 1854 to 1960 and the post-colonial period, from 1960 to the present time. Each of these periods has its distinct features though the first two fused together to produce a newly emerging Nigerian landscape development even though with greater colonial influence. The paper also discusses the role of different levels of government, non-governmental organizations and individuals during these periods. It, however, makes suggestions on the need to encourage citizen participation, particularly the poor majority and the need for appropriate manpower. The problem of religion and culture are examined as these are major constraints outside the government machinery to formal landscape development in the country.

AB  - In urban areas, the requirements of social, economic, and ecological sustainable development are usually intertwined with the problems of land-use intransigence, fragmentation, and deterioration of quality of natural systems. This study aims at the application of ecological principles to develop an integrated urban land-use planning for Panyu case that could optimize the urban ecosystem. Panyu is classified into four functional zones: (1) ecological protection areas, which are important to maintain regional ecological process; (2) re- stricted construction areas, which can be changed and adjusted over time without losing the conservation potential; (3) suitable construction areas, which are set aside for future development; and (4) built-up areas. Different land-use management measures with emphases either on ecological aims or on construction are proposed. Ecological patches are connected by corridors to form an ecological network, which is spatially flexible and has the potential to integrate development and conservation and make conservation of species diversity adaptive. The writers predict that ecosystem service will increase by 16.91% after the implementation of their plan.

AB  - Although the concept of 'land use planning' is now firmly enmeshed in American urban planning, its meaning still remains vague. This paper aims to clarify the meaning by examining the historical development of land use planning in the USA. At the beginning of the twentieth century, city planners viewed a city as an organic unit of public facilities. While city planning thereafter provided potential elements of land use planning, such as zoning, zoning surveys and land use classification systems, the idea of land use planning itself was actually derived from rural county planning and was initially utilized in urban county planning as a guide for zoning in the 1930s. After bringing about a change in the way cities were viewed, that is, as a pattern of land use and population density, land use planning was further employed as a guide for urban redevelopment policies in the 1940s, and finally reaching full integration into city planning in the 1950s and 1960s.

AB  - This paper is concerned with two developments which place questions about the home center-stage in urban geography, namely the growth of new information and communications technologies (ICT) and the rise of "critical geographies." The paper draws on an empirical in vestigation into British children's domestic use of ICT to move beyond utopian and dystopian hyperbole about the future of the home in the wired world and consider how children's ICT usage is shaped within and reshapes the home environment. In so doing, the paper both broadens and deepens the conceptualization of home in urban geography. In terms of breadth, the analysis illustrates the importance of including children's as well as adults' voices and experiences in studies of domestic life. In terms of depth, it highlights the importance of studying the micro-geographies of home as well as how social relations within the home shape its relation to the wider world.

AB  - Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model-a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.

AB  - This paper serves as an introduction to this special issue on new developments in urban transportation planning. The papers in this issue highlight how physical mobility is still an essential priority for urban life, but that there are associated costs in the terms of environmental impacts, quality of life and economic performance of cities. Four features of the emerging urban transportation field are identified. The first defining feature is that it is a discipline in the midst of a paradigmatic transition. Second is its overarching aim of achieving sustainable urban mobility as part of a broader effort towards enhancing quality of life in cities. The third feature is the emphasis on collaboration, integration and exchange with other professions and policy sectors. The last distinctive feature is the recognition that urban transportation planning is a communication-oriented activity.

AB  - For large Asian cities situated on deltaic lowlands, landform transformation is essential for both agrarian and urban development. Understanding landform transformation processes and patterns is important for landscape planning in areas of mixed urban-rural land use on the periphery of these cities. We examined landform transformation processes and patterns in Bangkok at three scales: (1) meso-scale quantitative landform analysis on the urban fringe of Bangkok using aerial photograph interpretation and topographic measurements; (2) micro-scale field measurements in sample districts to investigate relationships between building styles and the types of fill material used; (3) macro-scale analysis of the flow of fill material from source areas outside Bangkok to end use on the urban-rural fringe of the city. Our study showed that the type and the cumulative volume of fill material used are related to past agricultural land-use patterns, which in turn are related to the pre-existing natural local environment. We found associations between building styles and types of fill material used: townhouses are built on clay fill foundations, whereas condominiums and roads with heavy traffic loads are built on sand fill. Each type of fill has a different flow from source to end use that is influenced by geologic and economic conditions. The flow of clay fill is limited to the meso-scale urban fringe area, whereas sand fill travels from sand pits on a natural sand levee 100 km upstream from its end use on the urban fringe. The sand output at its source was estimated to be 1.5 ?? 105 m3 day-1, which, depending on cost, is either trucked or transported by river to the urban fringe development areas. Thus, landform transformation was found to occur at multiple scales in the Bangkok region, and the delta is no longer flat. These findings suggest that deltaic landscape planning should incorporate the means of managing the flow of fill material from source pits to end use in urban fringe development areas. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper explores the use of virtual environment (VE) technology in urban planning. The case we select is that of public engagement with the process of government, which in its traditional form suffers from several limitations. A three-dimensional (3D) cityscape environment has been implemented, where people can observe planning changes, access information, and comment on proposed designs. Our research focuses on the mechanisms of interaction inside this environment. We propose that VE technology will facilitate and improve useful engagement by the public in the planning processes, unlike the traditional consultation process. In order to test our hypothesis, we have built a VE city model. Early results have shown that the model was suitable for general public use, in terms of technological availability and usability. This paper presents results of experiments undertaken with the general public and urban planning professionals to judge their motivation in using this technology as a way to facilitate public consultation in the planning changes.

AB  - Crime disorder, and fear can erode the hearts of neighbirhoods and cities and undo the best efforts of planners, but planners typically have not made crime central to their concerns. This paper examines the crime of burglary, which may appear to be benign relative to the more violent forms of crime in the United States, but in its consequences for victims can be quite severe. Since burglars use features of the environment to increase their payoffs while reducing their risks, planners can help to thwart them. The burglary process unfolds in phases, and can be interrupted by the offender at any point at which the information available to the burglar at that point does not satisfy his criteria as to the ratio of risk versus reward. The research reported on here examines the phase where the burglar has already selected a house as a target and has begun the attempt to enter it. Whether the burglary is completed or aborted was found to be associated with neighborhood disorganization and home occupancy; other factors assumed to be important at this phase of the process. such as burglar alarms, extra looks on doors, etc., did not prove to be so. Neighborhood disorganization and home occupancy are both sensitive to programs and variables influenced by planners. Through trying to understand and control burglary, planners can develope approaches that will enable them to help deal with other forms of crime.

AB  - The power failure that affected several northeastern states in the US as well as the Canadian province of Ontario highlighted just how precarious the ecologies of daily lives are. The SARS epidemic that affected Toronto was further proof that we are always only one species-boundary, one rural-urban trip or transcontinental flight away from the nature that most observers considered definitively in the past. Our urban lives depend fundamentally on global ecologies and the political economies that uphold them. Processes of urban-nature relationships have been newly defined in the global age as societal relationships to nature have, like many other things, been globalized.

AB  - Critical urban geography came to dominate knowledge production in urban geography during the 1990s. This extremely fruitful research program nevertheless faces certain bounds to knowledge production that hinder its ongoing vitality. With respect to conceptual approaches, there has been considerable unbounding from an earlier focus on class and commodity production, recognizing the importance of other axes of social differentiation for urban processes and urban lives. Transcending a bounded conception of cities as objects of inquiry has been slower. With respect to philosophical foundations, strenuously contested philosophical boundaries persist between critical and other urban geography and within critical urban geography. With respect to participation in knowledge production, disciplinary boundaries marginalize knowledge situated in non-White communities and the global south, and critical urban geographers face criticism for failing to broaden knowledge production beyond the Ivory Tower. Notwithstanding a good track record of policy-oriented research, critical urban geographers need to decenter knowledge production, by including disadvantaged communities as full partners in this process. Helen Longino provides critical urban geographers a model for unbounded, nonrelativist and nonmonist knowledge production.

AB  - The greatest effects of the Federal Aid highway-oriented policy have been social, economic, and environmental. People have been displaced, neighborhoods have been changed, business patterns have been altered, the air has been polluted, and our cities even look very different—primarily as a result of building urban highways and freeways. A study of a freeway under construction in Akron, OH illustrates some of these effects of highway-oriented transportation planning. This particular freeway, although only partially finished, has had numerous social, economic, environmental effects and if finished will have many more. Some of the effects have either tended to perpetuate or aggravate already existing problems, with the result that the overall quality of life has been impacted thereby.

AB  - This paper documents a research project being carried out by the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT.) The goal of the project is to improve the economic and environmental sustainability of urban areas through compatible systems-level planning of land uses, urban form, and investments in public transportation facilities. The project also seeks to improve the communication of these concepts to elected officials and the public through the development of enhanced visualization techniques. The research is intended to answer questions about the interactions of land use policies and transit investments, posed in two forms. First, if alternative transit investment proposals are being evaluated for a community, what land use policies will be needed to optimize the effectiveness of those investments? Second, if specific changes in land use policy are being considered for a community, what types of transit investment will be most cost-effective for each land use policy scenario?. © ASCE.

AB  - Many urban university campuses are considered major trip attractors. Considering the multimodal and complex nature of university campus transportation planning and operation, this paper proposes a dynamic traffic simulation and assignment analysis approach and demonstrates how such a methodology can be successfully applied. Central to the research is the estimation of trip origin-destinations and the calibration of a parking lot choice model. Dynamic simulation is utilized to simulate multiple modes of transportation within the transportation network while further assigning these modes with respect to various mode-specific roadway accessibilities. A multiple vehicle-class simulation analysis for planning purposes becomes a critical capability to predict how faculty and staff who once parked within the campus core choose other nearby alternate parking lots. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing integrated and reliable solutions for challenging questions that face urban university campus planners and local transportation jurisdictions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The island of Puerto Rico has both a high population density and a long history of ineffective land use planning. This study integrates geospatial technology and population census data to understand how people use and develop the lands. We define three new regions for Puerto Rico: Urban (16%), Densely Populated Rural (36%), and Sparsely Populated Rural (48%). Eleven percent of the island is composed of urban/built-up surfaces. A large part of these developments occur in both low-density patterns of construction and sparsely populated neighborhoods. Half of the urban development occurs outside of urban centers. This analysis helps differentiate zones in the landscape with different uses and conditions, identifying not only urban and rural settings, but also the interface where development occurs in a territory dominated by forests and pastures, analogous to a wildland urban interface. The ineffective plan of land development has left a high degree of urban sprawl in 40% of island, where cities and towns appear typically surrounded by sprawl. The San Juan Metropolitan Area is one of the most expanded urbanized areas with a population of 2-2.5 million, comparable with the most sprawled cities of the U.S. mainland. This study reinforces the need for an efficient land use planning, and provides information to support research and planning efforts related to land development and conservation. It represents the first approach integrating satellite imagery with population census data for studying the human environment in the Caribbean. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract A long history of overt discrimination left an enduring racialized imprint upon the geography of the East Bay. While the benefits of a metropolitan decentralization of jobs, housing, and public investment fell to Whites, discrimination in employment and housing trapped African Americans in urban neighborhoods burdened by infrastructure encroachment and divestment. By circa 1970, overt discrimination succumbed to new, racially neutral, legal, and administrative forms, including regional planning processes. Using an environmental racism framework, we show that these new forms reproduced the existing racialized geography by means of new inequalities in representation and transportation service provision. These new regional transportation policies, like those challenged by a 2005 civil rights lawsuit, favored the mobility needs of more affluent suburbanites over those of African American East Bay bus riders. These policies, layered onto an existing racialized geography, reinforced existing inequalities by failing to address racial barriers to opportunity in the built environment.

AB  - The movement of people, goods, and information within the local metropolitan area is critically important to the functioning of cities. This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

From specific examples from the authors’ research, it is argued that the two distinct but overlapping notions of assembling and worlding help us conceptualize the contemporary urban–global condition. Building on the article’s insights, we end this Urban Pulse with some questions for future global urban studies.

AB  - This study discusses the validity and usability of land use as an aspect of sustainable building. Buildings have an effect on land use not only because of the extraction and processing of raw materials and disposal of wastes but also because buildings occupy land during their entire service life. In addition, location of buildings has an effect on the need of networks – such as traffic networks – and their land use. Land use related indicators are typically included in the European voluntary assessment systems of sustainable buildings. ISO 21929-1 defines two land use indicators for buildings: soil sealing and land use change. However, there is neither consensus nor a harmonised method to assess this issue. As an example, land use was not included in EN 15978:2011 due to lack of agreement on a calculation method. This study outlines the environmental aspects of buildings’ land use, assesses the significance of land use that happens because of the land occupation of buildings compared to the land use because of the extraction of raw materials needed for the construction of buildings. The study has also includes information about the benchmarks of buildings in terms of land use related indicators, discusses, ands make conclusions about the compatibility of building level indicators with the urban level indicators.

AB  - Urbanisation is a rapidly growing phenomenon that is affecting global biodiversity, but the integration of conservation goals into urban planning can minimise ecological damage. Conservation planning for birds can be informed by knowledge of species-habitat relationships, but opportunities for studying these relationships before urbanisation occurs are rare. Our study took place in the Molonglo Valley, southeastern Australia, where approximately 30% of the area will be developed for new human settlement over the next 30 years. We surveyed 80 sites for birds and used multiple regression to explore the role that land use, vegetation cover and structure play on total species richness, woodland species richness and prevalence (proportion of total species), and also on the presence of 10 woodland species. We found that total species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodland. Woodland species richness was higher in river corridors and eucalypt woodlands, and when leaf litter was present. Woodland species prevalence was higher in river corridors and when leaf litter and eucalypt regeneration were present. Individual woodland species showed a range of responses to five main structural and compositional categories: (1) land use, (2) tree cover and composition, (3) eucalypt regeneration, (4) shrub cover, and (5) ground cover attributes. We use these data on bird-habitat relationships to develop five recommendations on: (1) eucalypt woodland, (2) high quality riparian areas, (3) scattered trees, (4) eucalypt regeneration, and (5) structurally complex habitats, to aid policy makers, planners and developers to integrate conservation for woodland birds into their urban planning. ?? 2010.

AB  - The effectiveness of the mapping and assessment of Quality of Life (QoL) in the identification of problem areas and in monitoring development policies makes it a suitable method in poverty studies. In an attempt to enhance QoL as a strategy for poverty alleviation decision-making, this research has adopted the analytical tool of Geographical Information System (GIS). Twelve indicators were used to assess the QoL of Egor Local Government Area (LGA), Edo State, Nigeria. These indicators were grouped into three different domains of life (social, economic and physical). Spatial autocorrelation check was performed on the indicators to determine the spatial prediction method that was used to map each indicator. Of all these indicators, only two were spatially auto-correlated. The two indicators were mapped using the Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The other indicators were mapped using the voronoi polygons. The twelve models were used to model and assess QoL with the utilization of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. The weights used for the combination of the various mapped indicators were given by the respondents. The QoL model was cross-validated using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation method. The result showed that the QoL of 61.53% of the geographic space of Egor LGA was below average, 17.94% was extremely poor, and 14.55% was average, while the classes above average and excellent were not on the QoL model. In addition, the research identified priority development areas and concluded that the QoL of the people of Egor LGA was poor and required urgent conscious intervention by all development partners including the government.

AB  - Human geographers have recently rethought the concept of geographic scale in important ways that have unrealized potential for the urban-geographic study of the relative spatiality of urban processes and forms. Yet in an influential 2005 article, Marston, Jones III, and Woodward suggested that scale should be "expurgated" from the human geographical lexicon, an argument they have more recently reiterated. My article questions this on both theoretical and empirical grounds. First, I consider the origins of hierarchical, vertically ordered scale to suggest such interpretations may inhere more in a territorialized imaginary in political geography than scale itself. Second, I propose an urban-geographic rereading of scale as a volumetric, networked, space of flows. Exploring this idea through the example of Wal-Mart's "geography of big things," I suggest we need to recover and elaborate scale to better understand the outsized spatiality of the big box and the global commodity chains in which it is embedded.

After a literature review of related studies conducted in different parts of the world over the past decade or so, the major theoretical and methodological advances in stated preference (SP) surveys are summarized. Then, the paper continues to suggest ways of how SP techniques can be used side-by-side with the traditional four-stage transportation planning model. Lastly, it concludes with some future directions of change if these useful techniques are to play a more important role in planning for sustainable urban transportation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The argument in this paper is that we now need to move beyond the theoretical horizons of postfordism and to seek out a sui generis description of contemporary capitalism and its urban-economic geography. Three major characteristics of today’s capitalism are singled out as exerting major impacts on the geographical reconstruction of the world as we know it: (1) digital technologies, (2) the new division of labor, and (3) the deeply intensifying role of knowledge and human sensibility in the labor process. The implications of these phenomena for urban form and regional development are discussed, with special reference to the cognitive-cultural economy of large cities. Recent transformations of the interstitial spaces between these cities are also consid- ered. The argument goes on to place all of these issues in a wider spatial and organizational con- text in which the world is represented as a multifaceted, multitiered system of spatial convergence and differentiation. Some of the broad cultural and political meanings of this process are consid- ered. [Key

AB  - The tradition of American cultural geography was defined by studies of the rural, and in its more prosaic form focused on cataloging and mapping artifacts such as fence posts, barn types, and gravestones in order to delimit culture areas. In contrast, the city was all but ignored, treated as a cultural vacuum, and conceived only as a site of work, production, and economic relations. Hence, the importance of urban spatial science that from the late 1950s formalized that economism as central place theory, or Alonso's map of bid-rent curves, or models of retail location. Even when urban geography began eschewing formal models and theory, turning toward some kind of Marxist approach during the 1970s, the focus on things economic remained, but couched now in a different vocabulary such as rent gap, urban gatekeepers, and uneven development. The economism of spatial science and Marxism could not be sustained, however. Culture had to be let in. From 1990 pressured by outside theoretical developments such as cultural studies, and postmodernism, and changes from inside the discipline such as the rise of the new cultural geography, urban geography finally cracked, explicitly allowing culture in first as a trickle, but by the end of that decade as a flood. Culture had finally left the farm and hit the streets.

The approach is tested with randomly selected samples from the known portions of 1997, 2002, and 2007 US Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) O–D value and tonnage matrices and validated with 2007 US O–D tonnage matrix at the state level. The missing data are also estimated for the 2007 CFS tonnage matrix with the best intercept and coefficients obtained using all known entries of the matrix. The concept of the approach can be extended beyond the gravity model to any strong mathematical pattern embedded in the known set of a sparse O–D matrix to estimate its missing cells.

AB  - Internationally, there is increasing responsibility on local governments to prepare and adapt to global climate change through climate adaptation planning. This study evaluated seven local climate adaptation plans in Southeast Queensland, Australia by developing and applying a quantitative, multi-criteria anal- ysis framework. The results indicated that local governments were not effectively planning for climate impacts. While they were aware of expected climate change impacts, their capacity to use this information to develop geographically specific action plans was limited. We discuss the wider relevance of the eval- uation framework, its potential uses outside the study area and how it may be adjusted to suit different local and regional needs and context. We also discuss key structural, procedural and contextual limita- tions that emerged from our evaluation of Southeast local governments, and provide recommendations to improve the development of the next generation of local climate adaptation plans.

AB  - The creation of a more sustainable countryside has become a very important item across the world. Several methods, approaches and policies can be applied and agencies, interests groups etc. can become active in this regard. Land-use planning, as one of these activities, is challenged to play an active role in obtaining sustainable rural systems. The paper focuses first on what land-use planning is and what the different steps are or can be in the process of planning the future uses of land. Secondly, it demonstrates the approach through so-called spatial concepts. Three examples are explored: the segregation vs. the integration concept; the concept of the framework planning; and finally, the concept of ecological networks or infrastructure. Finally, the way in which these spatial concepts are or can be applied, is discussed. Included are some critical remarks with regard to the application of spatial concepts in land-use planning, together with the introduction of a new phenomenon in land development policies: that of the rural renewing.

They are (1) the debates about structure and human agency. (2) the claims of feminists about the analytical significance of the social construction of gender roles, and (3) the demand that we now use our social theories more actively to explain experienced reality. In continuing our use of social theory in urban geography, we must prevent its marginalization as one specific substantive topic; the alternative epistemologies of this type of work can guide new interpretations of every substantive issue in urban geography.

AB  - Evaluation of urban planning implementation (UPI) has attracted extensive attention from urban planners and researchers in recent years. Existing literature, however, mainly focuses on the conformity approach and does not take the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of UPI into account. In addition, previous research failed to distinguish the effects of urban planning from other institutional forces, as well as market incentives on urban expansion. To bridge this gap, we proposed a spatiotemporal approach to evaluate the effectiveness of UPI based on logistic regression and geographical information system (GIS) by identifying the spatiotemporal heterogeneous effects of urban planning on urban expansion. An empirical research was conducted in the Beijing Metropolitan Area (BMA) by analyzing five urban master plans drafted in 1958, 1973, 1982, 1992 and 2004. Five periods from 1947 to 2008 were examined to evaluate the dynamic effects of each master plan and other related factors. The effects of the 2004 Urban Master Plan on 16 districts in Beijing were estimated to identify the spatial variations of UPI. Within the context of China's booming economy, the results indicate that the effects of urban planning during the urban expansion increase over time, and are significantly stronger in exurban areas than in central cities and suburban areas. In addition, based on logistic regression results, we adopted an existing urban expansion simulation model to geographically visualize the impact of urban planning on future urban expansion, namely urban planning implementation effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

AB  - The quantitative revolution in urban-economic geography flourished in\nthe 1960s at a time when United States domestic policy focused on\ncities, problems of race and poverty, urban renewal and housing, land\nuse and transportation, and environmental pollution. Theoretical work in\nprevious decades in economic geography, spatial analysis, and\nquantitative social science had set the stage for the 1960s. After\ncomputers came along, psychology and economics moved briskly into\ntheoretical areas, with application of quantitative analysis and\nstatistical analysis, while applied mathematics vaguely promised to\nunify theoretical and applied realms of social science. Geography's main\nresearch agendas through the 1950s had been dominated by physical\ngeography and regional analysis, but a new generation of scholars at\nWashington, Northwestern, Michigan, Ohio State, Chicago, Minnesota, and\nPenn State pushed ahead with serious attention to theory development and\nquantification in human geography and statistical cartography. Scholars\nworking on the fringes of other disciplines (e.g., Isard) as well as\ninside geography (e.g., Hagerstrand, Berry, Garrison, Haggett, Chorley,\nHarvey) produced work attractive to the new geography. Mayer and Kohn\nassembled a stimulating reader illustrating theoretical and applied\nurban problems using the new approaches. Despite advances in the 1960s\nand early 1970s, the results of the quantitative revolution in human\ngeography in general-and in urban geography in particular-fell well\nshort of their promise. New ideas, approaches, methods, and problems\nwere never fully exploited or pursued. The reasons are unclear-perhaps\nwe should try to find out why.

AB  - Two notable trends in immigrant gateway cities—the growth of immigrant-owned businesses and accelerated ethnic marketing efforts of mainstream firms—raise an interesting research question of how ethnicity interacts with accessibility in the geography of consumption. Given that many immigrants today are better educated and more affluent than their predecessors, and an ethnic business and its mass counterpart can differ little in size and product variety terms, it is intriguing to discover how urban consumers choose between businesses owned and operated by ethnic minorities and those in the mass market. Based on two surveys, this article compares the grocery shopping behavior of Chinese immigrants and the rest of the population in two study areas in one of the most culturally diverse urban regions of the world—Toronto, Canada. Although a large Chinese population and mainstream supermarkets are found in both locations, one of the study areas is characterized by a high concentration of Chinese supermarkets, and the other contains only one. Analyses show that Chinese and non-Chinese populations in Toronto exhibit distinct grocery shopping behaviors. Chinese supermarkets and mainstream supermarkets are complementary consumption sites for Chinese residents but independent ones for non- Chinese. The role of ethnicity/culture is strong. Recognizing the sociocultural embeddedness of immigrant shoppers and the cultural representation of ethnic retail spaces, this study raises the question of how effective ethnic marketing can be in the case of grocery retailing from the perspective of both mainstream and Chinese businesses, with implications for immigrant community development, urban retail planning, and national multicultural and integration policies.

AB  - Since the beginning of the sustainability debate approximately 20 years ago, all parties involved in the urban planning process have been expected to devise sustainable solutions to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Potential to include sustainability criteria is present in the strategic planning stage and during the initial studies of a project. However, instruments available at these early stages are rare and show numerous weaknesses. The present study intends to close this gap by developing an instrument for the prioritization of sustain- ability criteria in urban planning processes. It is based on the Sustainable Building Tool 07 (SBTool 07), a comprehensive and well- established tool for the assessment of sustainability of construction projects, key issues pertaining to the initial planning stages are identified via a materiality matrix—a method established for corporate sustainability reporting. The resulting method has been tested in a competition in the Icelandic city of Reykjavík. Results include a materiality matrix on stakeholder priorities and the relevance of criteria to sustainability across the life cycle as well as a core set of 19 criteria to be addressed in Reykjavík

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the idea of the topological city, both by sharing some observations about the use of topology in critical human geography today and also by demonstrating how different modes of topological analyses of the city may work. This paper suggests that while topology is not new to the social sciences in general or geography in particular, an uptick in interest in topology in the past decade is likely due to its role in the work of Deleuze and Agamben. Topology, I suggest, can help geographers think in creative ways about spatial ontology, thereby offering some insights into the relationship between the subject and the city. I build this argument by discussing the topological workings of three cinematic cities: The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Midnight in Paris (2011), and Inception (2010).

AB  - Air pollution in Europe is one of the environmental factors that contribute the most to environment-related diseases. An evaluation made by the World Health Organization (WHO) [WHO, 2004] suggests that air pollution is responsible, each year, for 100.000 deaths in the largest European cities. Besides that recent studies have shown that different city structures have different implications on air quality [e.g. Lyons et al., 2003; Borrego et al., 2006]. The SaudAr project, presented in this work, was idealized to better understand the relation air pollution-health and shed some light on how to minimize those health impacts. The main objective was to study the air quality effects on health in a population group risk (school children) living in an urban area not yet polluted, but for which is foreseen an important development with possible environmental problems. Then, a case study was selected based on the ten most important Portuguese towns located on the inland part of the country, where a better air quality and population health are expected, and where the existing development dynamics suggest an environmental degradation in the near future. The city of Viseu was selected as case study, because of its strategic location in the central Portuguese mainland, very close to important road transport networks and its high projected development. The local municipality strategic development plan establishes the placement of different activities, the changes in land use, and defines the foreseen structural dynamics, such as road transport networks, housing or industrial areas. Based on those features and on several discussion with local authorities (namely the municipality planning department), future scenarios of urban sprawl were designed, using social, economic, demographic, technological and urban development indicators. These scenarios have then been translated into air pollutant emissions scenarios to assess future air quality on the region as well as human exposure. Numerical tools were applied to estimate air quality and human exposure changes related with the future scenarios. This methodology allowed to: 1) analyze the consequences on respiratory human health due to exposure to pollutants concentration; 2) investigate the impacts of future scenarios on air quality and human health; 3) define guidelines for local development plans. The results of all the developed scenarios show that the most critical pollutant in Viseu is PM10, similarly to what was verified in the current situation. However, the scenarios results allowed to conclude that the compact city has the lowest absolute emissions than disperse one, but the higher emissions per area. This results in higher human exposure in the compact city. The information obtained from SaudAr project has a significant interest to help the municipal authorities to prevent air pollution and population health problems in the future and it may be used to redefine the town strategic plan. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - This research note provides a unique empirical corroboration of the spatial interdependencies-between prisons and cities-suggested by the critical incarceration literature. Specifically, this research note examines the spatial structure of imprisonment in terms of distances and population flows between prisons and cities. It draws on Georgia Department of Corrections prison admission records, 1990-2006, and analyzes these records using gravity model and principal components analysis approaches. The principal findings are that: (1) prisoners are generally held great distances from their homes; and (2) that prison population flows in the Georgia case are spatially structured by the state's urban geography.

AB  - There is little information available on the spatial variation of landscape functions. We developed a methodological framework to map and quantify landscape functions depending on the availability of spatial information. In this framework three different methods were proposed (1) linking landscape functions to land cover or policy defined areas, (2) assessing landscape functions with empirical models using spatial indicators and (3) assessing landscape functions using decision rules based on literature reviews. The framework was applied to the Gelderse Vallei, a transitional rural area in the Netherlands. We successfully mapped and quantified the capacities to provide goods and services of eight landscape functions (residential, intensive livestock, drinking water, cultural heritage, tourism, plant habitat. arable production, and leisure cycling function) for this region. These function maps provide policy makers valuable information on regional qualities in terms of landscape functionality. Making landscape functions spatial explicit, adds an important component to research conducted in the field of quantification of landscape goods and services. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Historically, transportation planning has emphasized mobility by private vehicles. A more balanced approach, one that respects resource limits and acknowledges sustainability goals, is needed. Transportation is a means, not an end in and of itself, and must be planned accordingly. In estimating future travel demand, researchers are now using statistical models that recognize new highway improvements induce new trips. The focus is also shifting to understanding how urban activities and interpersonal relationships shape travel behavior. Planning for accessibility as a complement to mobility-based planning gives legitimacy to land-use initiatives like traditional neighborhood designs and transit-supportive developments. When concerns like livability and sustainability are weighed, transportation initiatives such as traffic-calmed streets and cooperative-based car-sharing gain wider acceptance. Evolving economic, demographic, and urbanization trends pose significant challenges to the future of transportation planning. Advanced information technologies will allow motorists to follow less congested paths. Also, they enable congestion charges to be passed on to motorists, as currently applied in Singapore. Hardware improvements, however, must be matched by supporting institutional initiatives which improve the coordination between transportation and land-use programs. Public–private partnerships, regional transportation authorities, and large-scale smart-growth are promising ways of delivering efficient and safe transportation services that promote a more livable and sustainable future.

AB  - The rapid growth of cities around the world is now seen as a major   contributor to global biodiversity loss and many governments include   biodiversity conservation as an explicit policy goal. To help prevent   further loss of biodiversity, there is an urgent need for more strategic   approaches to conservation planning in urban environments based on a   scientific understanding of landscape patterns, species requirements and   development pressures. In this study, we demonstrate the use of new   conservation planning tools to better integrate information on   threatened species into landuse planning. We present a case study in the   Greater Melbourne area that utilises the Zonation conservation planning   tool with data for 30 threatened fauna species. We perform a   multi-species spatial prioritisation that incorporates species-specific   connectivity requirements and demonstrate the use of this information in   a number of landuse planning contexts. First, we quantitatively assess   the differences between Melbourne's current conservation areas with the   locations prioritised by Zonation and determine priority areas for their   extension. We then show how the prioritisation can be used in decisions   regarding Melbourne's Urban Growth Boundary and in rezoning land for   development. Finally, we demonstrate how the prioritisation can be used   to identify areas of conservation significance within individual   developments that account for the wider landscape context. These results   demonstrate how conservation planning tools can be better integrated   into the different stages of landuse planning for future urban growth.   (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With these guidelines,we start an attempt to develop a meaningful understanding, to give guidance and to establish standards in planning land use.In the process of doing so, a certain amount of leeway shall be maintained in order to take regional and local peculiarities into consideration when using the land use planning approach.The concept of LUP considers regional and local conditions in order to meet their peculiarities in an optimal way. Consequently, Land Use Planning: Methods, Strategies and Tools are rather guidelines than a classic manual offering a blueprint. It brings together important ideas and experiences which should be adapted and applied to the specific working conditions in a project. The application for these guidelines is exclusively targeted at rural regions.Urban centres are therefore not included. The content is divided into seven chapters,which are assigned to three different subjects. Chapters 1 and 2 define the policy and planning framework of the GTZ- concept to land use planning.Chapter 3 introduces the components for the organisation of an implementation- orientated planning process. Chapters 4 to 7 discuss, some important aspects of implementation and of land use planning in greater detail. Additional questions arising in the various chapters are dealt with in the eight appendices.

AB  - The 1960s were times of considerable change both within the discipline of geography and in the geography of urban areas. Urban geography came of age in a time when suburbanization and major population decentralization were transforming both inner cities and the outer reaches of the newly expanding cities. Geographers joined planners to investigate the nature and significance of these changes and moved from largely descriptive interpretations of cities and city sites to attempts to theorize the urban transformation. The move to theory and conceptualization placed urban geography at the heart of the changing concept of the discipline and it remains central even in the face of increasing splintering of human geography. The influence of a small group of geographers at the University of Chicago and the University of Washington resonated across the U.S., and the Pacific, through the edited collection of articles in Readings in Urban Geography (Mayer and Kohn) and Studies of Highway Development and Geographic Change (Garrison, Berry, Marble, Nystuen and Morrill). Those volumes contained theoretical insights and rich empirical analysis, hallmarks of the creativity of urban geographers in the 1960s.

The literature also grew more diverse as researchers took on the economic, social, cultural, and political changes that were occurring as a result of new spatial divisions of labor and the "new economy." Within this expanded literature, and within the social science literature generally, the theoretical roles of space and place were strongly reasserted.

AB  - Effective management of interfaces between procurement, supply, production and distribution for higher efficiency in the supply chain is an important issue in global manufacturing, where the synchronization of production and transportation planning represents important savings in operational costs. This paper focuses on the synchronization of production planning and transportation planning in a production distribution network, where transportation is subcontracted to a professional transportation enterprise (PTE) for vehicle-hiring. Dynamic and flexible numbers of vehicles are used to cater for fast changing market demands. Thus, the number of vehicles to be hired is viewed from the planning point of view as an operational decision considered simultaneously with production and transportation planning. A mathematical model - SPTP/MTDS - for synchronized production and transportation planning under multiple times and direct shipping strategy (MTDS) is discussed, and a Lagrange relaxation decomposition-based two layer decision procedure (LRD-TLDP) is developed. By introducing artificial decision variables and Lagrange multipliers, SPTP/MTDS is decomposed into a production decision sub-problem (SPTP-PD), and a distribution decision sub-problem (SPTP-DD). A priority-based assignment heuristic and a partial chain-based genetic algorithm are developed to solve SPTP-PD and SPTP-DD, respectively. An illustration of the application of the model in an electronic appliance manufacturing enterprise in China is presented.

AB  - AbstractUrban land-use planning is becoming increasingly complex in China because it requires estimating the future urban extent and balancing its various aspects, e.g., provision of enough housing and employment opportunities and preservation of the environment. This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system. In addition to these nonspatial goals, objectives concerning the spatial distrib...

AB  - The articles published in Landscape and Urban Planning during the past 16 years provide valuable insights into how humans interact with outdoor urban environments. This review paper explores the wide spectrum of human dimensions and issues, or human needs, addressed by 90 of these studies. As a basis for analysis, the major themes tapped by the findings were classified into two overarching groups containing three categories each. The Nature needs, directly linked with the physical features of the environmental setting, were categorized in terms of contact with nature, aesthetic preference, and recreation and play. The role of the environment is less immediate in the Human-interaction group, which includes the issues of social interaction, citizen participation in the design process, and community identity. Most significantly, the publications offer strong support for the important role nearby natural environments play in human well-being. Urban settings that provide nature contact are valuable not only in their own right, but also for meeting other needs in a manner unique to these more natural settings. In addition, although addressed in different ways, remarkable similarities exist concerning these six people requirements across diverse cultures and political systems. Urban residents worldwide express a desire for contact with nature and each other, attractive environments, places in which to recreate and play, privacy, a more active role in the design of their community, and a sense of community identity. The studies reviewed here offer continued evidence that the design of urban landscapes strongly influences the well-being and behavior of users and nearby inhabitants.

AB  - Non-urbanized areas (NUAs) are outdoor places with significant amounts of vegetation. They are mainly semi-natural patches that represent the last remnants of nature in metropolitan areas. As part of the agricultural and green infrastructure they provide ecosystem services, such as purification of air and water, mitigation of floods and droughts, re-generation of soil fertility, moderation of temperature extremes and enhancing of landscape quality. Like all natural ecosystems, NUAs today are endangered by urban sprawl, which is the main cause of their fragmentation and loss of evapotranspiration features. For these reasons, the protection of these areas is a fundamental issue for land-use planning, and it requires appropriate strategies for their management. We propose a land-use suitability strategy, based on five different analytical phases, to address the land-use of NUAs: (1) land-use and land cover analysis quantifies the percentage of evapotranspiring surface for each land-use; (2) fragmentation analysis assesses the size and density of NUAs; (3) proximity analysis takes into account the degree to which NUAs are close to residential areas; (4) the results from these analyses are integrated in a land-use suitability matrix, which produces as output a new scenario of prospective land-uses for NUAs; (5) a compatibility matrix verifies the correspondence of these new land-uses with the current ones to confirm or modify the proposed land-uses. The resulting scenario allows to enhance the production of ecosystem services and define new appropriate land-uses for NUAs within the agricultural and green infrastructure. The method is tested on three municipalities within the Catania metropolitan area (Italy), characterized by a considerable urban sprawl. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper details the development of a strategic-level modelling tool to evaluate the impacts of air quality and greenhouse gas mitigation strategies for urban freight. The model, known as STEAR-F (Strategic Tool for the Environmental Analysis of Road Freight) combines publicly available information on freight travel, fleet characteristics, and emission factors to provide estimates of total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. Following details of the model development and underlying assumptions, STEAR-F is applied to evaluate strategies currently under consideration in the Sydney region. These include accelerated vehicle scrappage programs, diesel vehicle retrofit programs, Low Emission Zones, alternative fuel programs, and educational/information programs focused on driver behaviour, new technologies and proactive vehicle maintenance.

AB  - A large number of techniques for conserving energy in urban passenger transport are described. A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - A case study describing the application of conflict analysis to a public engagement program of urban planning in Hong Kong is presented in this paper. The technique of conflict analysis is used to investigate the possible conflicts and alliance between interest groups in order to avoid opinion domination by those groups that generate the loudest noise in the process of urban planning. The case study shows that this application helps collect public opinions more accurately that can represent the public interest in the selection of the best development and design scheme for the territory, which would not be corrupted by the “dominating opinions.” [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]\nCopyright of Journal of Urban Planning & Development is the property of American Society of Civil Engineers and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - In this paper we propose a dynamic Stackelberg game-theoretic model for urban freight transportation planning which is able to characterize the interaction between freight and personal transportation in an urban area. The problem is formulated as a bi-level dynamic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) which belongs to a class of computationally challenging problems. The lower level is dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) with inhommogeneous traffic that characterizes traffic system optimum (SO) freight transportation planning problem which aims at minimizing the total cost to a truck company. A mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) reformulation is derived and a projected gradient algorithm is designed to solve this computationally challenging problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to show that when planning freight transportation the background traffic is nonnegligible, even though the amount of trucks compared to other vehicles traveling on the same network is relatively small. What's more, in our proposed bi-level model for urban freight transportation planning, we find a dynamic case of a Braess-like Paradox which can provide managerial insights to a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) in increasing social welfare by restricting freight movement.

AB  - The urban transportation planning process is buffeted by one of the paradoxes of American public opinion. The public decries urban sprawl, but craves the comfort and convenience of the auto and larger homes and lots. Typically, planners and policymakers are unwilling to confront the contradiction between what the public says and what it does. But “new urbanists” are intent on changing preferences and behavior, and they have captured the urban transportation planning process in places like Portland. Portland’s Year 2000 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for a forecast year of 2020 illustrates the tension in the urban transportation planning process of balancing accommodation of powerful decentralizing trends and the advocacy of programs to reverse those trends.

AB  - Urban geography in the 1980s experienced significant transformations in theory, method, and practice largely from new currents in social theory. In this paper we describe and analyze the ways in which social theoretical influences shaped our own work as we entered the discipline first as graduate students and later as junior faculty. Drawn into the social theoretical currents that were swirling both within and outside (urban) geography, our own earliest work was an attempt to engage with and struggle against some of these currents. In our paper we address the theoretical, methodological and practical issues that most challenged us as representatives of a generation of urban geographers who "came of age" in the 1980s. We specifically address our common interest in making a space for a sophisticated conceptualization of agency in a paradigm of the urban political economy that was over-determined by structural theory. We use Caroline Steedman's Landscape for a Good Woman as an epistemological framework for thinking through our evolving feminist work on culture and social reproduction as well as an entry point into the dramatic changes that were occurring in geographers' theorizations of capitalist urbanization in the 1980s.

AB  - This paper asserts the continuing need for a long-range component to urban tran- sportation planning, citing particularly the relationships between short- and long-range planning and the dangers of a single-minded concentration on short-range planning. However, the nature of the long-range planning procedure that is required is substan- tively different from that of most extant approaches. Some of the specific requirements and capabilities of a new procedure are described, and existing procedures are compared against these. In the latter part of the paper, some of the elements of a new long-range planning procedure are characterized. It is suggested that the procedure be built around a scenario approach to confronting and bounding future uncertainty. Second, the need to incor- porate financial forecasting in the process is laid out and related to the scenario concept. Third, the need for travel- and impact-forecasting procedures is recognized and a set of input, output and operating requirements for such procedures are specified. It is sug- gested that improved sketch-planning tools may fit the requirements to a large extent. It is also suggested that some procedures or models in the process should be "synthetic" models, not needing calibration for each new application. Finally, a number of require- ments are specified for the display and evaluation of planning proposals from this pro- cedure. A major emphasis is placed here on transparency of the process and respon- siveness to direct intervention by the decision-maker.

AB  - Marxist geography has been at the forefront of understanding the urban   dynamic of advanced capitalism.  There is, however, a paradox in much of   this work.  Whereas Marxist geographers implicitly take workers'   experiences under capitalism as their political starting point,   ironically, much Marxist work in urban geography has tended to ignore   workers' proactive roles in shaping the urban landscape.  Rather,   Marxist urban geographers have focused largely on how capital and the   state shape the built environment.  Essentially, they have written urban   geographies from the perspective of capital and the state and, in so   doing, have failed to make working-class people the subjects of their   own historical geographies.  In this paper I argue that urban   geographers need to pay much greater attention to how workers and their   institutions shape the built environment.  To illustrate this argument I   draw upon the example of workers' struggles to control the geography of   work in the U.S. East Coast longshore industry.

AB  - rban planning (urban, city, and town planning) is a technical and political process concerned with the control of the use of land and design of the urban environment, including transportation networks, to guide and ensure the orderly development of settlements and communities. It concerns itself with research and analysis, strategic thinking, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management.[1] A plan can take a variety of forms including: strategic plans, comprehensive plans, neighborhood plans, regulatory and incentive strategies, or historic preservation plans. Planners are often also responsible for enforcing the chosen policies. The modern origins of urban planning lie in the movement for urban reform that arose as a reaction against the disorder of the industrial city in the mid-19th century. Urban planning can include urban renewal, by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from decline. In the late-20th century the term sustainable development has come to represent an ideal outcome in the sum of all planning goals.[2]

AB  - In this plenary, I call for urban geographers to frame public health as a form of urban politics, theorized as governmentality and biopower. I interpret the politics of venereal disease (VD) in Seattle during the mid-20th century this way, detecting a series of dualities in key dimensions of the governance of VD, thus extending geographers' work on these concepts. There was an epistemic duality between biomedical and social framings of disease, a simultaneous techne between ascending and descending modes of power; a duality between descriptive and predictive visibilities; an identity paradox around which bodies were at risk; and a duality in ethos between conservative and progressive principles. Interpreting the city politics of public health this way foregrounds this local-state function as an important topic for urban political geography and brings a series of literatures together into conversation that have tended to remain distinct.

AB  - This paper presents a definition of sustainable urban freight transport (SUFT), based on the existing theories and concepts, and develops an indicator set that describes SUFT. The definition of SUFT makes a categorisation of actions possible which enables actors to select effective strategies towards SUFT. The indicator set consists of two levels: impact indicators which describe how the urban freight transport violates the principles of sustainability; and performance indicators which describe different categories determining the characteristics and performance of the urban transport system. A literature study analyses the characteristics determining the performance of actors in the urban freight transport chain. Knowing the current state and improvement potential of the urban freight transport system are prerequisites for defining successful strategies and implementing effective actions.

AB  - Aims to respond to change and innovation within urban geography and to reduce confusion amongst undergraduate students. Whilst material is selective and contains little that is new, the book introduces the basic concepts of a distinctive discipline which is fundamental for practical action. A review of techniques, concepts and philosophies demonstrates the varied, changing approaches to urban analysis. Many difficulties of perception and definition arise. Cities, as centres of manufacturing, management and services, reveal complexities of funciton and linkage which modelling seeks to regularise in locational, hierarchical and developmental structures. Internally, structures have been analysed from a variety of social and political stances, none of which is entirely satisfactory in demonstrating the links between socio-economic process and urban pattern. A problem-oriented, examination of the causes and effects of planning procedures shows their increasingly comprehensive over-view, their influence on urban study and the contemporary urban crisis, and the fundamental value of urban geographical analysis to such interventionist influences. -D.A.Lewis

We explore how recent forms of feminist analysis and critical scholarship open up a conceptual terrain for such thinking and we ground our discussion with further details of City for All Women Initiative/ Initiative: une ville pour toutes les femmes (CAWI-IVTF) which we regard as a concrete, successful case. Its tactics and strategies are noteworthy because of the manner in which ideas drawn from feminist and progressive organizing in other, including non-urban and non-Western, contexts, have been incorporated. CAWI-IVTF‟s successes are most striking in relation to women who previously felt alienated from local politics. The organization‟s rationale, strategies and tactics provide insights into how women active in this network create new spatialities, and how their interactions in space are productive for creating new political subjects.

AB  - It is widely accepted that strong ties exist between land uses and the water quality of adjacent aquatic systems within a watershed. Recently, studies of the relationships between land uses and water quality have also begun to consider the spatial configuration of land uses. Herewe investigated the spatial con- figuration of land uses within watersheds in South Korea and examined how spatial patterns of urban, agricultural, and forest land uses measured at both landscape and class levels, related to water quality in adjacent reservoirs from landscape ecological perspective. The results indicate that water quality of reservoirs is closely associated with both the proportions of land use and the configurations of urban, agricultural, and forest areas.Water quality ismore likely to be degradedwhenthere is high interspersion of various land use types and when a large number of different land use types exist within awatershed. For urban land uses, high patch and edge densities, and urban land use as the largest patch, were also associated withwater quality degradation, aswere higher degrees of patch density and edge density for agricultural land uses.Water quality is likely better if forest patches are unfragmented, have a high value for the largest patch proportion, have complex patch shape, and are aggregated.

AB  - Current research on sustainability of cities has favoured the implementation and conservation of greenery in the urban context. The benefits of plants are not just environmental but recreational, aesthetic and emotional. The full benefits of plants and the role they play in the ecology of cities remain to be mapped out but the general significance of plants appears to be uncontested. This paper proposes a new architectural and planning metric for greenery in cities and buildings. This new metric, the green plot ratio (GPR), is based on a common biological parameter called the leaf area index (LAI), which is defined as the single-side leaf area per unit ground area. The green plot ratio is simply the average LAI of the greenery on site and is presented as a ratio that is similar to the building plot ratio (BPR) currently in use in many cities to control maximum allowable built-up floor area in a building development. GPR allows more precise regulation of greenery on site without excluding a corresponding portion of the site from building development. It provides flexibility to the designer while simultaneously protecting the green quota in the design. This concept has been applied in a number of design competitions in which the author has collaborated with colleagues and various architectural practices. It has also been adopted as a planning requirement by the client authority for one of the competitions for which the author has entered. While seen as a fundamental and important metric, GPR is not in itself an indicator for all the ecological relationships between plants and cities. A larger set of related metrics need to be developed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Commuting is the major source of congestion and air pollution in the United States. For almost a decade, urban policy-makers have been concerned about the geographical balance between locations of jobs and housing as a strategy for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in American cities. Despite the popularity and apparent acceptance of the job/housing (J/H) imbalance concept among public policy-makers, little empirical research has been done on the J/H imbalance and how it relates to commuting patterns. This research examines commuting patterns in the Atlanta metropolitan area to determine the extent to which commuting flow volume is the result of an imbalance between the location of home and workplace by using the most sophisticated and largest geographical scale data provided by the 1990 U.S. Census of Transportation Planning Package. This paper uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) to measure the job/housing imbalance within a commuting catchment area having a 7-mile radius from the centroid of each Transportation Analysis Zone. Analysis of variance, stepwise multiple regression and cartographic evidence all confirm the relationship between the imbalance of jobs and housing (J/H) and mean travel time to work. This investigation highlights the fact that the imbalance between the location of jobs and housing is the most important determinant for longer commuting and suggests that higher quality housing growth close to the job-rich communities may benefit the workers to economize the commuting time.

AB  - Abstract: Urban geographers would argue that cities are distinct spaces that need to be treated on their own terms. Yet I fear that we have not given the specificity of urban law its due. My aim is to give one crucial, yet easily overlooked urban legal practice, that of “police,” more careful attention. By “police” I mean “the regulation of the internal life of a community to promote gen- eral welfare and the condition of good order” (Neocleous, 2000, p. 1). I focus on the sidewalk as a particular police space. I also wish to demonstrate the distinctiveness of police, particularly when compared with rights-based understandings of public space. Yet the two frequently collide, as we can see with reference to a constitutional challenge to a sit/lie ordinance in Seattle. Police won, as it usually does. But to accuse police of an assault upon rights is, in several senses, beside the point, for police operates in a different register. Police thus must be understood on its own terms and not reduced to other governmental logics.

AB  - Two intersecting trends of the times—the growth of the $2.75 trillion world tourism industry and the growth of environmentalism as reflected in the high level of international participation at the 1992 Earth Summit—focus attention on the ideals of sustainable development and ecotourism and create a new niche for landscape architecture and urban planning. These overlapping fields have long attended to problems of conflicting values, aesthetics, recreation, and leisure. Many of the activities and products traditionally associated with design and planning are appropriate to tourism projects. Guidelines for enhancing this framework to treat directly the special problems of ecotourism include early investigation of sociological and ecological features, involvement of broker and local populations in the planning process, and extrasensitivity to issues of site selection, design, scale, and monitoring. In responding to the ecotourism challenge, landscape architects and urban planners will need to hone their abilities to work with multidisciplinary teams and to converse productively about preservation and development ethics.

AB  - <p>&nbsp;Local and urban authorities are increasingly seen as crucial in translating national and international agreements into locally applicable guidelines for the delivery of climate policy. It has been recognised that energy policy is a crucial area for bringing about emissions reductions, based on the close relationship between energy consumption and generation and greenhouse gas emissions. Against this background, this paper investigates how Barcelona and London are formulating urban planning policies that encourage the use of low-carbon and renewable energy technologies to meet the heating and electricity demands of new buildings and those undergoing major renovation. Drawing on theoretical insights from science and technology and urban studies, the paper contributes to the debate about changing patterns in urban energy provision, arguing that there are general aspects to reconfiguring energy patterns in the city, such as the technological choices involved in articulating more sustainable energy futures and socio-technical obduracies of established &#8216;urban energy regimes&#8217;. It is recognised that place-specific features must be taken into account in the process of reorienting cities' energy trajectories onto more sustainable pathways, in particular with respect to the potential for carbon mitigation from the built environment.</p>

AB  - In order to contribute to the sustainability of the urban environment, knowledge about the urban climate should be translated into climatic guidelines for planning. However, there are hardly any studies on applied urban climatology in areas with a Mediterranean type of climate. The study presented in this paper has several aims: to identify the climatic needs in a coastal city with Mediterranean climate; to describe the methodology, which can be adapted in order to be used in other cities; to discuss some of the problems that arise when applying climatic knowledge to urban planning, including the selection of the adequate scale of analysis, the required data and tools, the selection of the planning priorities, and the need to develop a shared language among planners and climatologists; and last to contribute to furthering the debate on the advantages of including climatic guidelines in Master Plans of urban municipalities in a systematic way. Lisbon's case study is presented. As planners need spatialized guidelines, the mapping of Lisbon's physical features was carried out using a Geographical Information System. Based on a Digital Terrain Model and on data of urban roughness a "ventilation map" was produced. A "building-density" map was also prepared based on the analysis of a Landsat image and field work. By crosstabulating these two layers, a final map depicting Lisbon's "homogeneous climatic-response units" was prepared. Finally, a series of climatic guidelines for planning were put forth for the different units. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few scientific analyses exist on how different land uses can be configured for greater support of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Based on ecological premises, and through a synthesis of information derived from the literature related to urban ecology, this paper elaborates on the potential biodiversity benefits of 'ecological land-use complementation' (ELC). The approach builds on the idea that land uses in urban green areas could synergistically interact to support biodiversity when clustered together in different combinations. As proposed, ELC may not only provide for increased habitat availability for species, but also promote landscape complementation/supplementation functions and other critical ecosystem processes; hence, realize 'emergent' ecological functions of land use. Planners and urban designers could adopt ELC to promote ecosystem resilience when planning new urban areas, such as in the support of 'response diversity' among functional species groups, and in the support of ecosystem services. ELC-structures in urban landscapes could also be used as arenas to promote participatory management approaches and Local Agenda 21. The paper concludes by summarizing some guiding principles for urban planning and design. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil represents a complex medium, which makes it difficult to evaluate its quality. In the past, soil quality evaluation was biased towards agricultural production rather than for purposes related to the broad range of functions and services that it performs. Soil function and soil quality in the urban environment differ due to the different needs and roles of soil within the diversity of urban land uses. The quality of urban soil should be evaluated to support public services for good environmental quality management. Planners should also adjust their decisions towards more sustainable urban design. Simple and applicable soil quality evaluation methods accompanied by an operations toolkit that could be used by laypeople are needed. This paper discusses soil functions, soil quality indicators, pedotransfer functions, and urban soil quality. It presents an urban soil quality evaluation method for different land uses within one particular evaluation system. The calculation of three one-value measures of soil quality are introduced: index of soil quality (expresses soil quality/suitability for a particular land use), soil environmental quality index (environmental value of soil) in terms of performing the crucial ecological functions of soil, and land use change index (land use planning impact assessment on soil resources). The use of the method is described in two procedures: urban soil quality control and soil evaluation for urban planning. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article offers a critique of the common practice of labeling an institution or group of people as a distinct school of thought, ideology, or methodology, and calls for more open, inclusive, and comparative research in urban geography. The former argument highlights the negative effects of within-group dialogue and its inherent exclusionary tendencies, whereas the latter stresses the role of context and contingency in understanding our cities. Examples are drawn from the experience and characteristics of North American cities to illustrate the crucial importance of national institutions, politics, culture, and geography in shaping those cities, and the challenges involved in writing theory and defining an inclusive research agenda.

AB  - Urban land structure, layout, and land-use mode influence regional sustainable development greatly. However, planners usually cannot work perfectly because of insufficient environmental information for decision making. In recent years, with urban geographic information system (GIS) development many cities have already built up integrated urban information platform to support regional digitalization process. By using spatial data mining technology urban planning related knowledge can be discovered form GIS database to help planners and decision makers in their work. Through analyzing of Chinese cities' construction mode and developing trend, this paper illustrates how to build up an urban planning spatial decision support system (UPSDSS) based on exploratory spatial data analysis technology support. By spatial data mining form GIS database, UPSDSS can provide related knowledge for urban planning decision making with inference engines (rule inference and case inference) support. As an important part of the research, UPSDSS had been used in urban planning management of Harbin city in China. With hidden information discovered by UPSDSS Harbin planners work easily and effectively. Three cases demonstrate how UPSDSS helped Harbin city in policy making in macroscopic urban expending planning, underground exploitation scheme making, and local land structure changing. © 2010 ASCE.

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In Australia, over 50% of threatened species occur within the urban fringe and accelerating urbanization is now a key threat. Biodiversity near and within urban areas brings much social benefit but its maintenance involves complex trade-offs between competing land uses. Urban design typically views biodiversity as a development constraint, not a value to be enhanced into the future. We argue that decisions could be more transparent and systematic and we demonstrate that efficient development solutions can be found that avoid areas important for biodiversity. We present a case study in the context of land use change across the city of Wyndham, a local Government west of Melbourne, Australia. We use reserve design tools in a novel way to identify priority development sites, based on a synthesis of ecological, social and economic data. Trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and other key development objectives and constraints (transport planning, flood risk and food production) are quantified. The analysis can be conducted dynamically with visually compelling output, facilitating more transparent, efficient and democratically derived urban planning solutions. We suggest that government agencies could adopt similar approaches to identify efficient planning solutions for both biodiversity and development in urban environments. ©

AB  - In this essay, I engage the L.A.-Chicago debate by repositioning both area-specific constraints and visual orders as intermediary variables. This leads the discussion to two considerations that in turn reposition the meaning of the familiar differences attributed to Los Angeles and Chicago. First, a focus on the particular implications of translocal processes for an area allows us to establish that agglomeration and dispersal might both be part of a given firm's or sector's chain of operations and that they might be distributed across very different types of geographic areas. The main implication for a comparison of the L.A. and Chicago models is that it makes problematic the notion that geographic dispersal à la L.A. is the new spatial form corresponding to today's new economy, and agglomeration à la Chicago belongs to an earlier modernity. The second focus is on the limits of homogenization and convergence in urban landscapes as explanations in comparative studies. I recode these homogenized landscapes—the hyperspace of global business—as an infrastructure: they are necessary but indeterminate in that they can be used for different purposes. This shifts the emphasis to what inhabits that built environment. A key underlying economic dynamic I find in my research is that the global economy thrives on the specialized differences of countries, regions, and cities. But it does need homogenized standards (e.g., of production, of financial reporting, of accounting, and the like), and I add, it also needs standardized built environments.

AB  - Land-cover and land-use (LCLU) change was quantified for the last 35 years within and in the vicinity of a fast growing city in Mexico, using rectified aerial photographs and geographic information systems (GIS). LCLU change was projected for the next 20 years using Markov chains and regression analyses. The study explored the relationships between urban growth and landscape change, and between urban growth and population growth. The analysis of Markov matrices suggests that the highest LCLU attractor is the city of Morelia, followed by plantations and croplands. Grasslands and shrublands are the least stable categories. The most powerful use of the Markov transition matrices seems to be at the descriptive rather than the predictive level. Linear regression between urban and population growth offered a more robust prediction of urban growth in Morelia. Hence, we suggest that linear regression should be used when projecting growth tendencies of cities in regions with similar characteristics.

Starting from an analysis of the city's climatological situation, a study is made of the performance of several internationally well-known "comfort indices" in a number of city districts considered to be characteristic, and defining the urban situation as a whole. Some of these comfort indices were formulated by green zones and it was later possible to find out the required size of such green zones for each district, in order for these to be theoretically considered comfortable. This methodology is considered valid as a tool for planners of big cities, in the design of green zones. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - It is a well established fact that the urban landscape creates a climate which influences, for example, human comfort, air quality and energy consumption. However, in spite of this knowledge, it has been recognised that climate issues often have low impact on the urban planning process in practice. The reason for this lack of influence is an important question for which answers must be sought among climatologists, planners and the planning process. The main objective with the present study was to investigate if, how and when knowledge about the climate is used in the urban planning process. The research strategy was developed in an interdisciplinary research group involving climatologists and planners. Case studies involving different interview techniques and historical data were carried out by different actors involved in urban planning at the municipality level in three cities in Sweden. The study showed that urban planners were interested in climatic aspects but the use of climatic information was unsystematic and the results confirmed that climatology has a low impact on the planning process. The low impact is a result of several constraints which could be related to five explanatory variables i.e. conceptual and knowledge based, technical, policy, organisational and the market. The discussion part of the paper presents some key conclusions which address these constraints. It is important that urban climatologists meet the planners demand-driven needs by providing them with good arguments, suitable methods and tools. Urban climatologists are also encouraged to improve the awareness of the importance of urban climate not only among planners but also among decision-makers and the public. However, as planning is a political activity which not always is based on or even related to scientific knowledge, some of the identified constraints could only be counteracted through improved institutional capacity in the social context of planning.

AB  - My initial armchair speculation about what had transpired in urban geography in the 1990s was rudely undermined by a look at the published literature. In the first part of this paper I describe the ways in which the weight of tradition is evident in the urban geography literature of the 1990s; tradition dominates in the topics and themes that are the focus of research, the types of cities studied, the epistemological and methodological approaches used, the gaps that are evident, and the disinclination to make clear the links between research and possible action. In the second part of the paper I describe three strands of path divergence that have emerged in the 1990s from these traditions, namely research on globalization, research on gender, and a greater diversity of methodological approaches and data sources used. In the final section I suggest how we might use tradition as a springboard to move urban geography beyond the 1990s. The topics that demand a larger share of our attention include those focused on the urban environment, sustainability, identity, and megacities in non-OECD countries. I propose that we work to ensure that our research on these and other topics is useful to certain audiences and constituencies by highlighting geographic scale and cross-scale processes and by crossing the permeable boundary that delineates academe.

However, this article argues that a more participatory approach is required in order to better understand household activity patterns and the effects and implications of travel on livelihoods. Such an understanding will enable transport planning and policy to support the needs of those on low income and achieve broader poverty alleviation objectives. This article draws on case studies undertaken in Harare (Zimbabwe), Accra (Ghana) and Colombo (Sri Lanka) as part of a broader study carried out for the UK Department for International Development (DfID) Knowledge and Research Programme. The article examines the effect of public transport on certain dimensions of poverty, considers the links between urban transport and other sectors (health, education and employment) and summarizes key methods of enquiry that might be adopted in effecting a more participatory approach to transport planning.

AB  - Disquiet about urban geography’s alleged lack of policy substance and practical relevance has resurfaced in a range of recent writings. While useful, much of the debate tends to “blame the victim,” in this instance, urban geography and geographers, for the inability to gen- erate research of relevance and interest to policy. As the paper will argue, urban geography and geographers are not “free-floating” or able to determine, without constraint, the relevance of urban geographical research to the production of public policy. Urban geographers, and geogra- phers more generally, are, therefore, advised to resist aspects of the “new turn” to policy and practice.

AB  - To address climate change, many U.S. states are taking action to establish policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all economic sectors. With the transportation sector contributing 28 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2006, strategies to mitigate transportation sector emissions are an important component of state's climate action plans. This paper summarizes the transportation and land use approaches that states have included in their climate action plans to date. Transportation and land use sector options are generally organized into three main categories: vehicle technology, fuels, and travel activity/land use. This paper adds a fourth category: vehicle operations to acknowledge that important mitigation options include how drivers operate their vehicles. Annual greenhouse gas reduction potential in 2012 and 2020 and cost effectiveness values are provided. The information in this paper provides a starting-point for transportation practitioners to use when initiating their own evaluations of greenhouse gas mitigation options at the regional, state, or local level.

AB  - Cities represent an important threat to biodiversity at different scales. Nevertheless, little is known on the processes underlying such effects. In this paper we describe bird diversity, structure, and composition patterns in different urban land-use categories. For this, we surveyed resident bird communities in four representative land-use categories of southwestern Mexico City. Our results show that bird communities vary greatly along the different studied urban land-uses, which represent an urbanization development gradient. Bird communities were highly dominated by few generalist species in areas with commercial components, while showed to have higher evenness values in green areas. Bird species richness decreased and bird abundances increased with urbanization intensity. Also, our results indicate that bird species richness and abundance values are sensible to site-specific habitat characteristics. Although we did not find a clear pattern of taxonomic homogenization related to urbanization, our results show that urbanization development entails the functional homogenization of bird communities. Thus, based on our results, we suggest three urban planning and management activities: (1) regulate land-use change related to urbanization; (2) increase the number of green areas within the city; (3) establish bird monitoring programs to identify focal areas that need management and assist with ecological data for urban planning.

AB  - Two million people will die in earthquakes in the twenty-first century assuming no increase in the average annual rate of deaths from the twentieth century. The economic result is a financial loss of five trillion dollars to the world's economy in current dollar terms, and probably a comparable but lower financial figure for the building losses. This human economic loss represents six quarters of US government consumption on defense and non-defense spending, or about twenty-times the period in Australian gross domestic product terms. The probable largest fatal earthquake, defined as the probable century event with a one percent probability in the century, will have a death toll in the range of three-hundred-thousand to one million people, coupled with a significant loss of dwellings, factories, and production capacity for the city that bears this disaster. The death toll will be as high as thirty percent of the population in the peak felt intensity region of the earthquake zone. Two to three earthquakes in this century will have death tolls in the range of one hundred to three-hundred-thousand people. There are one-hundred and twenty-five urban areas that have sufficient population and population density to sustain a loss of the one million people. The bulk of these one-hundred and twenty-five urban areas are located in the intraplate regions of the world including the Central and Eastern United States (twenty five), Australia (two), Europe, China, and India. Interplate earthquakes occur on the edges of the major tectonic plates, whilst intraplate earthquakes occur within the tectonic plates. This distinct geologic feature between interplate and intraplate means that an earthquake with a Richter magnitude of six in an interplate region, such as Kobe, has about the equivalent destructive power as a Richter 5.2 in an intraplate region, such as Sydney or New York. Three significant issues arise for planning for a city, such as Sydney, Australia or New York, to deal with this fatal event. The first issue is that the probability of the major event occurring in each one of the one-hundred and twenty-five urban areas is poorly understood. The historical earthquake and geologic data does not support reducing the probability of each of the one-hundred and twenty-five urban area of suffering from this major event from the average of 0.8 percent without investigating the probability distribution of deaths of the preceding two millennia. The second issue is how to develop the key components of an interdisciplinary planning strategy for a compact major urban area to mitigate the losses in a probable century event. The third issue is to equitably deal with this loss from the world insurance perspective. This paper outlines the preliminary research into these three issues from a town planning perspective using Sydney, Australia as the city example. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In all scenarios, urban growth arises from the increase in population particularly, due to tourism and economic change. However, the spatial patterns are different due to alternative assumptions about urban development processes/purposes. The results of modelling are successfully illustrated in a spectrum of possible land use/land cover change scenarios for year 2020.

AB  - Given the accelerating rate of urbanization worldwide, the sustainable provision of urban ecosystem services becomes increasingly important for the growing number of city dwellers. Attempts to increase a single ecosystem service however often lead to reduction or losses of others. For making sound decisions about sustainable urban development, knowledge and awareness of the interactions between ecosystem services are thus necessary. In this paper, we show how interactive rulers embedded in a 3D GIS-based procedural modeling environment can assist in making urban ecosystem services trade-offs explicit for sustainable urban planning. The interactive rulers are slider bars that offer stakeholders the possibility to explore trade-offs in ecosystem services reflected in different urban designs. The approach is illustrated in a case study in Abu Dhabi, Masdar City, a new city designed from scratch. An interactive 3D visualization approach links parametric shape grammars for the design of generative urban patterns and the reporting of urban ecosystem services. We show how various urban design scenarios can be generated in an interactive manner allowing a balance between the esthetics of the urban designs and a set of indicators describing the provision of relevant ecosystem services. With this approach, the space for actions and behavioral alternatives become explicit - a crucial step for sustainable urban planning which calls for innovative strategies to adapt to these uncertain and rapid changes. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We examine land-owning organizations' choice of strategy for steering spatial development. There are two highly visible strategies to influence land use. The first one, acquisition, is direct; it consists of either gaining outright ownership of the land, or various forms of partial title, including conservation easements. The second one, regulation, is indirect; it relies on the legal instruments of public policy, in particular land use planning, to influence the behavior of landowners. Often linking these two strategies in a coherent way is a challenge. On the one hand, local authorities are empowered by the law to plan for conservation, but they are not well equipped to do so (lack of capacity, expertise, political will). On the other hand, many small conservation NGOs are active at the micro level with little concern for supra-local considerations.Focusing on an important private conservation effort in Southern Quebec, this article seeks to better understand land-owning organizations' position toward land use planning. It shows how conservation NGOs, which rely on property rights to influence land use, position themselves within the broader regulatory context and attempt to coordinate their action at a regional scale in order to complement their acquisition strategy. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The role of housing Finance in neighborhood change has long been a Fixture of urban geography, In the last decade, however, residential mortgage lending has been transformed by economic growth and an expanded secondary market, regulatory intervention designed to eliminate discrimination and expand access to home ownership, and aggressive industry efforts to capture "underserved markets." In this paper I use Atlanta, Georgia, as a case study to assess changes in the spatial allocation of mortgage capital, the persistence of racial disparities in loan rejection, and the systematic disinvestment from urban neighborhoods that cannot be justified on the basis of demand-side factors. Analysis of conventional home-purchase loans by depositories reveals only slight change in the geography of capital investment between the 1980s and 1990s. Logistic regression models of loan rejection in the expansion of the 1990s confirm a stark institutional segmentation of the mortgage market, durable racial disparities, and marked disinvestment effects that constrain the geography of residential choice by reinforcing deeply entrenched processes of uneven urban development.

The results demonstrate that large trees can provide up to 70% shade during spring and autumn, thus saving a very large amount of energy along the whole year. Hence, economic value of larger trees is greater than that of younger species. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This progress report examines recent research in the field of Middle East urban studies over the past half decade and is divided thematically into two parts. This first essay, "Middle East Urban Studies: Identity and Meaning," will address the problematic question of the Islamic city model and its meaning. The second essay, "Middle East Urban Studies: Growth, Environment, and Management," to appear in a later issue, will review the research on urban growth in the region, including the work of physical geographers on the urban environment as well as planning and policy perspectives on urban growth management. These essays address both research pertaining to the "Islamic city," which is to be understood as an urban form shaped by Islam, be it located in Indonesia or Jordan, and research pertaining to urban development in the Middle East. Of course, geographers have not reached consensus on the boundaries for this region, but research on urban issues from Morocco in the west to Iran and Turkey in the east has been included. An examination of current research on Middle East urban studies must look beyond geography's borders to include a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary group of Middle East specialists. Such a large net is needed to capture recent research in Middle East urban studies for both practical as well as intellectual reasons. On a practical level, only a handful of European and Anglo-American geographers specialize in the Middle East and its urban issues, and to examine only their work would indeed result in a very brief progress report and a limited view of the subfield. Intellectually, one cannot claim to examine Middle East urban research while ignoring the contributions of Middle East area specialists in fields including urban history, architecture, planning, and anthropology. It should be noted that much of the research on Middle East urban studies is not readily available in English, including the extensive contribution of French scholars, especially on the Maghreb. For readers desiring a record of earlier research on the Middle Eastern city, including citations to works in French and German, I would highly recommend Bonine et al.'s (1994) comprehensive annotated bibliography The Middle Eastern City and Islamic Urbanism, as well as a recent summation by Kopp (1999). This progress report also does not include the body of work produced in Arabic by indigenous scholars of the region, though a review of current articles on human geography in Arabic is available in Falah (1999). Research by Israeli scholars, who tend to publish more frequently in English, is more accessible and is surveyed in these essays. References: Number: 33 SUBJECT(S)

AB  - AbstractLand use planning plays an important role in achieving sustainable urban development. One of the problems planners frequently encounter is the absence of an integrated quantitative approach to assessing land-use suitability and supporting land use planning (site level), particularly in urban renewal. This paper develops a geographic information system (GIS)-based framework to solve this problem. The framework consists of three main modules: land information database, planning/policy control mechanism, and model of land-use suitability analysis (LUSA). In the process of developing this framework, three tasks are completed. First, key factors affecting land-use decision making in urban renewal planning are identified and 20 of them are quantitatively examined from five perspectives of land attributes: inherent/physical, locational, social, economic, and environmental. Second, two submodels, namely, the criterion-value generation model and suitability assessment model are designed and built for LUSA ...

AB  - Recent research and professional interest in planning for sustainable and resilient cities emphasizes the assessment of a broad spectrum of urban ecosystem services. While such assessments are useful to establish specific benchmarks, and for measuring progress toward sustainability and resilience goals, they do not motivate, or support the innovations required to provide specific ecosystem services as an intentional part of routine urban and infrastructure development activity by municipalities and professionals. In this context, predictions for unprecedented future urbanization and development of new urban infrastructure represent a unique opportunity to "learn-by-doing". Significant advances in urban sustainability have recently been made through transdisciplinary collaborations among researchers, professionals, decision-makers and stakeholders. However, these advances, often through pilot projects, have limited transferability to other cities due to the inherent biophysical and cultural uniqueness of the city in which they originated, and of the projects and plans themselves. The promise of practicing "learning-by-doing", therefore, remains an elusive goal, not yet fully integrated with urban development. In this essay, a framework for "safe to fail" adaptive urban design is proposed to integrate science, professional practice, and stakeholder participation. The framework is a transdisciplinary working method, and includes experimental design guidelines, monitoring and assessment protocols and strategies for realizing specific urban ecosystem services integral with urban development. The "safe-to-fail" adaptive urban design framework encourages and rewards innovation in a low-risk context - while assessing the achievement and performance of the specific intended ecosystem services. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract: This research note provides a unique empirical corroboration of the spatial interdependencies— between prisons and cities—suggested by the critical incarceration literature. Specifically, this research note examines the spatial structure of imprisonment in terms of distances and population flows between prisons and cities. It draws on Georgia Department of Corrections prison admission records, 1990–2006, and analyzes these records using gravity model and principal components analysis approaches. The principal findings are that: (1) prisoners are generally held great distances from their homes; and (2) that prison population flows in the Georgia case are spatially structured by the state’s urban geography.

AB  - The rapid growth of cities around the world is now seen as a major contributor to global biodiversity loss and many governments include biodiversity conservation as an explicit policy goal. To help prevent further loss of biodiversity, there is an urgent need for more strategic approaches to conservation planning in urban environments based on a scientific understanding of landscape patterns, species requirements and development pressures. In this study, we demonstrate the use of new conservation planning tools to better integrate information on threatened species into landuse planning. We present a case study in the Greater Melbourne area that utilises the Zonation conservation planning tool with data for 30 threatened fauna species. We perform a multi-species spatial prioritisation that incorporates species-specific connectivity requirements and demonstrate the use of this information in a number of landuse planning contexts. First, we quantitatively assess the differences between Melbourne's current conservation areas with the locations prioritised by Zonation and determine priority areas for their extension. We then show how the prioritisation can be used in decisions regarding Melbourne's Urban Growth Boundary and in rezoning land for development. Finally, we demonstrate how the prioritisation can be used to identify areas of conservation significance within individual developments that account for the wider landscape context. These results demonstrate how conservation planning tools can be better integrated into the different stages of landuse planning for future urban growth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dans le cadre des modifications des configurations spatiales des zones métropolitaires américaines, il étudie la manière dont les technologies de l'information entrent en interaction avec les localisations, les transports et les variables socio-économiques. En prenant l'exemple de Boston, il s'intéresse notamment à l'accessibilité à l'emploi. La localisation comme facteur explicatif est moins importante que les transports et les télécommunications".

AB  - Drawing on a rich diversity of theoretical approaches and practical strategies, urban geographers are at the forefront of understanding the global and local processes shaping cities, and of making sense of the urban experiences of a wide variety of social groups. Through their links with urban policy makers, urban geographers have also played an important role in the examination of the economic and social problems confronting cities.\nThe Urban Geography Reader captures this diversity by presenting a stimulating selection of articles and excerpts by leading figures in the field organized around seven themes. The themes address the changing economic, social, cultural, and technological conditions of contemporary urbanization and the range of personal and public responses. Bringing together in one volume classic and contemporary pieces of urban geography, studies undertaken in the developed and developing worlds, and examples of theory and practice, this reader provides an unparalleled resource for those interested in the complex geographies of urban areas.\n\n\nContents:\nPart 1: Foundations 1.
