AB  - Abstract: Urban geographers would argue that cities are distinct spaces that need to be treated on their own terms. Yet I fear that we have not given the specificity of urban law its due. My aim is to give one crucial, yet easily overlooked urban legal practice, that of “police,” more careful attention. By “police” I mean “the regulation of the internal life of a community to promote gen- eral welfare and the condition of good order” (Neocleous, 2000, p. 1). I focus on the sidewalk as a particular police space. I also wish to demonstrate the distinctiveness of police, particularly when compared with rights-based understandings of public space. Yet the two frequently collide, as we can see with reference to a constitutional challenge to a sit/lie ordinance in Seattle. Police won, as it usually does. But to accuse police of an assault upon rights is, in several senses, beside the point, for police operates in a different register. Police thus must be understood on its own terms and not reduced to other governmental logics.

AB  - Aims to respond to change and innovation within urban geography and to reduce confusion amongst undergraduate students. Whilst material is selective and contains little that is new, the book introduces the basic concepts of a distinctive discipline which is fundamental for practical action. A review of techniques, concepts and philosophies demonstrates the varied, changing approaches to urban analysis. Many difficulties of perception and definition arise. Cities, as centres of manufacturing, management and services, reveal complexities of funciton and linkage which modelling seeks to regularise in locational, hierarchical and developmental structures. Internally, structures have been analysed from a variety of social and political stances, none of which is entirely satisfactory in demonstrating the links between socio-economic process and urban pattern. A problem-oriented, examination of the causes and effects of planning procedures shows their increasingly comprehensive over-view, their influence on urban study and the contemporary urban crisis, and the fundamental value of urban geographical analysis to such interventionist influences. -D.A.Lewis

AB  - My initial armchair speculation about what had transpired in urban geography in the 1990s was rudely undermined by a look at the published literature. In the first part of this paper I describe the ways in which the weight of tradition is evident in the urban geography literature of the 1990s; tradition dominates in the topics and themes that are the focus of research, the types of cities studied, the epistemological and methodological approaches used, the gaps that are evident, and the disinclination to make clear the links between research and possible action. In the second part of the paper I describe three strands of path divergence that have emerged in the 1990s from these traditions, namely research on globalization, research on gender, and a greater diversity of methodological approaches and data sources used. In the final section I suggest how we might use tradition as a springboard to move urban geography beyond the 1990s. The topics that demand a larger share of our attention include those focused on the urban environment, sustainability, identity, and megacities in non-OECD countries. I propose that we work to ensure that our research on these and other topics is useful to certain audiences and constituencies by highlighting geographic scale and cross-scale processes and by crossing the permeable boundary that delineates academe.

AB  - This paper develops a log-linear regression approach to estimate missing data in a sparse origin–destination (O–D) matrix assuming the sampled or observed O–D trips follow a good gravity pattern. The approach is tested with randomly selected samples from the known portions of 1997, 2002, and 2007 US Commodity Flow Survey (CFS) O–D value and tonnage matrices and validated with 2007 US O–D tonnage matrix at the state level. The missing data are also estimated for the 2007 CFS tonnage matrix with the best intercept and coefficients obtained using all known entries of the matrix. The concept of the approach can be extended beyond the gravity model to any strong mathematical pattern embedded in the known set of a sparse O–D matrix to estimate its missing cells.

AB  - Many urban university campuses are considered major trip attractors. Considering the multimodal and complex nature of university campus transportation planning and operation, this paper proposes a dynamic traffic simulation and assignment analysis approach and demonstrates how such a methodology can be successfully applied. Central to the research is the estimation of trip origin-destinations and the calibration of a parking lot choice model. Dynamic simulation is utilized to simulate multiple modes of transportation within the transportation network while further assigning these modes with respect to various mode-specific roadway accessibilities. A multiple vehicle-class simulation analysis for planning purposes becomes a critical capability to predict how faculty and staff who once parked within the campus core choose other nearby alternate parking lots. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing integrated and reliable solutions for challenging questions that face urban university campus planners and local transportation jurisdictions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Vulnerability resulting from debt is part and parcel of the risk society and a salient characteristic of current neoliberal times under financialized global capitalism. Rising indebted- ness increases the susceptibility of homeowners to housing and labor market restructuring, and if the degree of leverage is very high, can threaten the solvency, living standards, and social stabil- ity of local communities. However, very little is understood regarding how levels of household indebtedness are spatially distributed within or across cities, and how private debt maps onto the geography of race, class, housing, urban form, and other social variables, especially outside of the United States. It remains unknown whether and how higher and unsustainable levels of indebted- ness might be associated with urban growth, decline, suburbanization, gentrification, immigra- tion, racialization, and/or greying. This article examines the spatial distribution of household debt in Canadian cities at multiple scales of analysis. It analyzes how levels of household debt relate to a number of key socio-demographic and housing variables from the census, including those related to changes occurring over the 2000s. It simultaneously models the geography of debt at the metropolitan and neighborhood scales using multi-level hierarchical linear modeling methods, and in doing so, it identifies some key drivers and correlates of household debt and the scales at which they operate. The article concludes by discussing the implications of the empirical find- ings for understanding the role of the emerging urban debtscape in the restructuring of the social geography of the city.

AB  - Increasing transportation cost will decrease the urban radius, population density and land rent for all locations except the CBD in an open city. But in the closed city land rent and population density increase in the CBD and decrease at the urban margins. Household response to changes in transportation cost depends upon the spatial location of households. The real price of gasoline has not increased greatly, and nominally high gasoline prices alone do not necessarily contribute to urban core revitalization.-from Author

AB  - This paper presents a definition of sustainable urban freight transport (SUFT), based on the existing theories and concepts, and develops an indicator set that describes SUFT. The definition of SUFT makes a categorisation of actions possible which enables actors to select effective strategies towards SUFT. The indicator set consists of two levels: impact indicators which describe how the urban freight transport violates the principles of sustainability; and performance indicators which describe different categories determining the characteristics and performance of the urban transport system. A literature study analyses the characteristics determining the performance of actors in the urban freight transport chain. Knowing the current state and improvement potential of the urban freight transport system are prerequisites for defining successful strategies and implementing effective actions.

AB  - The literature in urban geography grew rapidly in the 1980s, with a general shift of academic interest toward cities and urbanization that was prompted by a global economy that was increasingly articulated through networks of cities, and by an awareness that the world's population was rapidly becoming increasingly urbanized. The literature also grew more diverse as researchers took on the economic, social, cultural, and political changes that were occurring as a result of new spatial divisions of labor and the "new economy." Within this expanded literature, and within the social science literature generally, the theoretical roles of space and place were strongly reasserted.

AB  - This research note provides a unique empirical corroboration of the spatial interdependencies-between prisons and cities-suggested by the critical incarceration literature. Specifically, this research note examines the spatial structure of imprisonment in terms of distances and population flows between prisons and cities. It draws on Georgia Department of Corrections prison admission records, 1990-2006, and analyzes these records using gravity model and principal components analysis approaches. The principal findings are that: (1) prisoners are generally held great distances from their homes; and (2) that prison population flows in the Georgia case are spatially structured by the state's urban geography.

AB  - Cities across the world are changing rapidly, influenced by the forces of economic and cultural globalization and by the pressures for environmental, economic and social sustainability. City economies, landscapes, images, environments and social geographies are changing as a result of these forces. This third edition of Urban Geography continues to examine the new geographical patterns that are forming within cities and the ways in which geographers have sought to make sense of this urban transformation. Introducing both traditional and contemporary approaches and perspectives in urban geography, this book examines the globalization of the urbanization process and explores ways in which governments and institutions have responded to the resulting challenges. This extensively revised new edition styled in a student friendly chapter format, includes a new chapter on urban regeneration and comprehensively updated case studies, all illustrated by numerous figures, photos and table. This is a valuable introduction to urban geography for all geography students. About the Author Tim Hall is at the University of Gloucestershire, UK.

Linkages between cities are created using the stock-ownership levels between headquarters cities of investors and headquarters cities of firms. Both cartographic and statistical methods show that the urban connections describe a highly selective network of high-order urban centers. New York City is the dominant city, followed by Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and San Francisco. A simple gravity model, used to test the level of the effect of space on market perfection, explains a substantial portion of the investment-defined network. Differences between the levels of investment by different classes of institutional investors also are revealed.

AB  - In this paper we propose a dynamic Stackelberg game-theoretic model for urban freight transportation planning which is able to characterize the interaction between freight and personal transportation in an urban area. The problem is formulated as a bi-level dynamic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) which belongs to a class of computationally challenging problems. The lower level is dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) with inhommogeneous traffic that characterizes traffic system optimum (SO) freight transportation planning problem which aims at minimizing the total cost to a truck company. A mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC) reformulation is derived and a projected gradient algorithm is designed to solve this computationally challenging problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to show that when planning freight transportation the background traffic is nonnegligible, even though the amount of trucks compared to other vehicles traveling on the same network is relatively small. What's more, in our proposed bi-level model for urban freight transportation planning, we find a dynamic case of a Braess-like Paradox which can provide managerial insights to a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) in increasing social welfare by restricting freight movement.

AB  - Historically, transportation planning has emphasized mobility by private vehicles. A more balanced approach, one that respects resource limits and acknowledges sustainability goals, is needed. Transportation is a means, not an end in and of itself, and must be planned accordingly. In estimating future travel demand, researchers are now using statistical models that recognize new highway improvements induce new trips. The focus is also shifting to understanding how urban activities and interpersonal relationships shape travel behavior. Planning for accessibility as a complement to mobility-based planning gives legitimacy to land-use initiatives like traditional neighborhood designs and transit-supportive developments. When concerns like livability and sustainability are weighed, transportation initiatives such as traffic-calmed streets and cooperative-based car-sharing gain wider acceptance. Evolving economic, demographic, and urbanization trends pose significant challenges to the future of transportation planning. Advanced information technologies will allow motorists to follow less congested paths. Also, they enable congestion charges to be passed on to motorists, as currently applied in Singapore. Hardware improvements, however, must be matched by supporting institutional initiatives which improve the coordination between transportation and land-use programs. Public–private partnerships, regional transportation authorities, and large-scale smart-growth are promising ways of delivering efficient and safe transportation services that promote a more livable and sustainable future.

Through their links with urban policy makers, urban geographers have also played an important role in the examination of the economic and social problems confronting cities.\nThe Urban Geography Reader captures this diversity by presenting a stimulating selection of articles and excerpts by leading figures in the field organized around seven themes. The themes address the changing economic, social, cultural, and technological conditions of contemporary urbanization and the range of personal and public responses. Bringing together in one volume classic and contemporary pieces of urban geography, studies undertaken in the developed and developing worlds, and examples of theory and practice, this reader provides an unparalleled resource for those interested in the complex geographies of urban areas.\n\n\nContents:\nPart 1: Foundations 1.

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

AB  - Integrated Transportation Planning is a concept which suggests that a detailed package of environmental, social, economic and political tools is necessary to ensure the safe accessibility and mobility of people who wish to travel from one place to another. The notion of integrated transportation planning has steadily progressed over the years.  It began with traditional transport planning, oriented toward automobile traffic engineering, then progressed to "multi-modal planning" to include public transit modes.  It later broadened to include pedestrians, cycling, small vehicles and variable land use, and now extends furthermore to considerations of full environmental and cost impacts. Integrated transportation planning applies to rapidly urbanizing areas in growing economies and implies also that any environmental impacts should be minimized through comprehensive planning and implementation.  Integrated transportation planning includes a number of elements with the principal ones being: Enhanced Accessibility and Mobility for all, Environmental Sustainability, Participatory Planning, Transportation Demand Management, Transportation Systems Management, Comprehensive Land Use Planning, and Least Cost Optimization.  In a climate where traffic congestion, often unbearable air pollution, and ever dwindling energy supplies are becoming a major problem the world over, this paper considers blending specific elements to better achieve environmental and energy sustainability and to better serve the needs of people who wish to travel without impediment.

AB  - The rapid urbanization of land in the peri-urban West District surrounding Zanzibar city in Tanzania has occurred during a 20-year period of political and economic reform, with related reforms in the land sector. Utilizing 2006 and 2007 interviews with officials and residents alongside document and archival research, this study examines two themes in relation to Zanzibar's most prominent program of contemporary land reform, a Finnish-funded project for the Sustainable Management of Lands and Environment (SMOLE). These themes entail: (1) the importance of the historical-cultural geography of peri-urban land dynamics for dual reform (simultaneous political and economic reform) processes in Africa; and (2) the critique of pro-poor, neoliberal land reform for the disjunctures between its rhetoric, actual planning practice, and the beliefs and practices of the peri-urban poor, wherein we discover a lack of participation, transparency, or democracy in the land sector. The article's broader aim is to contribute a detailed African case study to urban political ecology's efforts to argue for democratization of the construction of social environments.

AB  - Human geographers have recently rethought the concept of geographic scale in important ways that have unrealized potential for the urban-geographic study of the relative spatiality of urban processes and forms. Yet in an influential 2005 article, Marston, Jones III, and Woodward suggested that scale should be "expurgated" from the human geographical lexicon, an argument they have more recently reiterated. My article questions this on both theoretical and empirical grounds. First, I consider the origins of hierarchical, vertically ordered scale to suggest such interpretations may inhere more in a territorialized imaginary in political geography than scale itself. Second, I propose an urban-geographic rereading of scale as a volumetric, networked, space of flows. Exploring this idea through the example of Wal-Mart's "geography of big things," I suggest we need to recover and elaborate scale to better understand the outsized spatiality of the big box and the global commodity chains in which it is embedded.

Discovering geographical variation in neoliberal policy should produce more incisive understandings of neoliberalism's creative transformations, yet the emergent research on comparative urban policy may route uncomfortably close to the world of world and global cites. This brief discussion considers expanding places of inquiry to non-growth economic contexts and complex urban conditions in the world of cities . It introduces contemporary conditions of urban political economy in the People's Republic of China, where neoliberalization works in the interests of the party-state and resists critical analysis in association with debates over strains of neoconservatism (neoauthoritarism, neosocialism, and statism) in the Chinese academy and their mutual imbrication in an array of complex issues.

This article provides the first-ever analysis of their formation in Greater Accra, Ghana. The analysis suggests that the globalization of real estate markets and Diaspora living are important aspects in the residential geography of Accra. The concept of "transnational houses" is employed to explain aspects of the local property market that are being globalized and differentiated from local housing. Transnational houses add another layer of diversity to the contemporary urban geography of Greater Accra.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore an important and unique role which community participation and involvement can play in a revised transportation plan- ning process. A review of diverse views about community participation, as well as a critique of the current urban transportation planning process, reveals that the former has played, primarily, ad hoc opportunistic and diverse roles, and that the latter is in desperate need for dynamic, subjective, "impact" information - required to assess attractive transportation systems. The contributions of several disciplines - eco- nomics, operations research, management science, political science, public administra- tion, and others - are reviewed to assist in the development of a conceptual frame- work for a new community participation role, as a provider of key information to the planning process. An eclectic, experimental approach is recommended to explore the possibilities further.

AB  - The urban transportation planning process is buffeted by one of the paradoxes of American public opinion. The public decries urban sprawl, but craves the comfort and convenience of the auto and larger homes and lots. Typically, planners and policymakers are unwilling to confront the contradiction between what the public says and what it does. But “new urbanists” are intent on changing preferences and behavior, and they have captured the urban transportation planning process in places like Portland. Portland’s Year 2000 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for a forecast year of 2020 illustrates the tension in the urban transportation planning process of balancing accommodation of powerful decentralizing trends and the advocacy of programs to reverse those trends.

AB  - Two notable trends in immigrant gateway cities—the growth of immigrant-owned businesses and accelerated ethnic marketing efforts of mainstream firms—raise an interesting research question of how ethnicity interacts with accessibility in the geography of consumption. Given that many immigrants today are better educated and more affluent than their predecessors, and an ethnic business and its mass counterpart can differ little in size and product variety terms, it is intriguing to discover how urban consumers choose between businesses owned and operated by ethnic minorities and those in the mass market. Based on two surveys, this article compares the grocery shopping behavior of Chinese immigrants and the rest of the population in two study areas in one of the most culturally diverse urban regions of the world—Toronto, Canada. Although a large Chinese population and mainstream supermarkets are found in both locations, one of the study areas is characterized by a high concentration of Chinese supermarkets, and the other contains only one. Analyses show that Chinese and non-Chinese populations in Toronto exhibit distinct grocery shopping behaviors. Chinese supermarkets and mainstream supermarkets are complementary consumption sites for Chinese residents but independent ones for non- Chinese. The role of ethnicity/culture is strong. Recognizing the sociocultural embeddedness of immigrant shoppers and the cultural representation of ethnic retail spaces, this study raises the question of how effective ethnic marketing can be in the case of grocery retailing from the perspective of both mainstream and Chinese businesses, with implications for immigrant community development, urban retail planning, and national multicultural and integration policies.

AB  - The argument in this paper is that we now need to move beyond the theoretical horizons of postfordism and to seek out a sui generis description of contemporary capitalism and its urban-economic geography. Three major characteristics of today’s capitalism are singled out as exerting major impacts on the geographical reconstruction of the world as we know it: (1) digital technologies, (2) the new division of labor, and (3) the deeply intensifying role of knowledge and human sensibility in the labor process. The implications of these phenomena for urban form and regional development are discussed, with special reference to the cognitive-cultural economy of large cities. Recent transformations of the interstitial spaces between these cities are also consid- ered. The argument goes on to place all of these issues in a wider spatial and organizational con- text in which the world is represented as a multifaceted, multitiered system of spatial convergence and differentiation. Some of the broad cultural and political meanings of this process are consid- ered. [Key

AB  - The 1960s were times of considerable change both within the discipline of geography and in the geography of urban areas. Urban geography came of age in a time when suburbanization and major population decentralization were transforming both inner cities and the outer reaches of the newly expanding cities. Geographers joined planners to investigate the nature and significance of these changes and moved from largely descriptive interpretations of cities and city sites to attempts to theorize the urban transformation. The move to theory and conceptualization placed urban geography at the heart of the changing concept of the discipline and it remains central even in the face of increasing splintering of human geography. The influence of a small group of geographers at the University of Chicago and the University of Washington resonated across the U.S., and the Pacific, through the edited collection of articles in Readings in Urban Geography (Mayer and Kohn) and Studies of Highway Development and Geographic Change (Garrison, Berry, Marble, Nystuen and Morrill). Those volumes contained theoretical insights and rich empirical analysis, hallmarks of the creativity of urban geographers in the 1960s.

AB  - The complexity of the modern firm is one of the defining features of the global economy. This study examines one dimension in which this complexity can be observed, the corporate subsidiary. Here we investigate where the headquarters of the largest subsidiaries are located in the United States, where subsidiary growth is occurring, and how the United States compared with Canada from 1996 to 2004. The results show that U.S. parent and subsidiary headquarters have different metropolitan distributions, and that 1996-2004 parent and subsidiary growth patterns were also distinct. New York saw its parent headquarters community grow, while its subsidiary headquarters community exhibited the sharpest decline of any U.S. metropolitan area. This spatial behavior was the opposite of what occurred in Canada, where Toronto dominated in subsidiary growth while experiencing one of the largest parent headquarters declines among Canadian metropolitan areas. Our study interprets these results and calls for further research to pursue the questions raised here. Copyright © 2009 by Bellwether Publishing, Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, this article argues that a more participatory approach is required in order to better understand household activity patterns and the effects and implications of travel on livelihoods. Such an understanding will enable transport planning and policy to support the needs of those on low income and achieve broader poverty alleviation objectives. This article draws on case studies undertaken in Harare (Zimbabwe), Accra (Ghana) and Colombo (Sri Lanka) as part of a broader study carried out for the UK Department for International Development (DfID) Knowledge and Research Programme. The article examines the effect of public transport on certain dimensions of poverty, considers the links between urban transport and other sectors (health, education and employment) and summarizes key methods of enquiry that might be adopted in effecting a more participatory approach to transport planning.

AB  - Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model-a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.

A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Urban geography in the 1980s experienced significant transformations in theory, method, and practice largely from new currents in social theory. In this paper we describe and analyze the ways in which social theoretical influences shaped our own work as we entered the discipline first as graduate students and later as junior faculty. Drawn into the social theoretical currents that were swirling both within and outside (urban) geography, our own earliest work was an attempt to engage with and struggle against some of these currents. In our paper we address the theoretical, methodological and practical issues that most challenged us as representatives of a generation of urban geographers who "came of age" in the 1980s. We specifically address our common interest in making a space for a sophisticated conceptualization of agency in a paradigm of the urban political economy that was over-determined by structural theory. We use Caroline Steedman's Landscape for a Good Woman as an epistemological framework for thinking through our evolving feminist work on culture and social reproduction as well as an entry point into the dramatic changes that were occurring in geographers' theorizations of capitalist urbanization in the 1980s.

Taking on venerable musicological debates from entirely\nnew perspectives, Krims argues that the cultural-studies approach now\npredominant in cultural musicology fails to address contemporary realities of\nproduction and consumption; instead, the social effects of space and new\npatterns of urban production play a shaping role, in which music takes on new\nforms and functions, with representation playing a significant but not always\ndecisive role. While music scholars increasingly concern themselves with\nplace, Krims theorizes it together with the shaping role of space. Pushing\nurban geography into new cultural contexts "Music and Urban Geography" will\noffer those concerned with the social effects of space new theoretical models.\nRanging from Anonymous 4 to Alanis Morissette, from Curacao to Seattle, "Music\nand Urban Geography" presents a truly wide-ranging, interdisciplinary, and\ntheoretically ambitious view of both musical and urban change.

These factors include geography, history, lifestyle, politics, and economics. This paper documents the conflict between development and slow-growth interests in the San Bernardino-Redlands area of southern California. Research presented focuses on the history and viability of agriculture, the origin of and forces behind the slow-growth movement, and the economic and social impact of growth-limiting policies. The conflict between developers and slow-growth proponents in Redlands demonstrates the inability of current land-use planning to deal effectively with a number of serious problems, including urban sprawl, the protection of valuable agricultural resources, and the provision of adequate and reasonably priced housing.

AB  - Marxist geography has been at the forefront of understanding the urban   dynamic of advanced capitalism.  There is, however, a paradox in much of   this work.  Whereas Marxist geographers implicitly take workers'   experiences under capitalism as their political starting point,   ironically, much Marxist work in urban geography has tended to ignore   workers' proactive roles in shaping the urban landscape.  Rather,   Marxist urban geographers have focused largely on how capital and the   state shape the built environment.  Essentially, they have written urban   geographies from the perspective of capital and the state and, in so   doing, have failed to make working-class people the subjects of their   own historical geographies.  In this paper I argue that urban   geographers need to pay much greater attention to how workers and their   institutions shape the built environment.  To illustrate this argument I   draw upon the example of workers' struggles to control the geography of   work in the U.S. East Coast longshore industry.

AB  - Communicative rationality offers a new paradigm for transportation planning. Drawing on the literature and lessons from transportation planning practice, this paper describes the characteristics of a ” communicative” form of transportation planning and compares them with conventional practices. A communicative rationality paradigm would place language and discourse at the core of transportation planning. The paper argues that it would lead to greater attention to desired transportation ends (goals), better integration of means and ends, new forms of participation and learning, and enhanced deliberative capacity. The paper explains the implications of this paradigm for the role of the transportation planner, the purpose of planning, the planning process, communicative practices, problem framing, and the nature of planning analysis. The paper concludes with an assessment of communicative rationality's ability to promote more effective transportation planning. It seeks to create a dialogue that will support the investigation of new transportation planning processes.

AB  - The role of housing Finance in neighborhood change has long been a Fixture of urban geography, In the last decade, however, residential mortgage lending has been transformed by economic growth and an expanded secondary market, regulatory intervention designed to eliminate discrimination and expand access to home ownership, and aggressive industry efforts to capture "underserved markets." In this paper I use Atlanta, Georgia, as a case study to assess changes in the spatial allocation of mortgage capital, the persistence of racial disparities in loan rejection, and the systematic disinvestment from urban neighborhoods that cannot be justified on the basis of demand-side factors. Analysis of conventional home-purchase loans by depositories reveals only slight change in the geography of capital investment between the 1980s and 1990s. Logistic regression models of loan rejection in the expansion of the 1990s confirm a stark institutional segmentation of the mortgage market, durable racial disparities, and marked disinvestment effects that constrain the geography of residential choice by reinforcing deeply entrenched processes of uneven urban development.

As the paper will argue, urban geography and geographers are not “free-floating” or able to determine, without constraint, the relevance of urban geographical research to the production of public policy.

AB  - Today, for the first time in the history of Humankind urban dwellers outnumber rural residents. Urban places, towns and cities, are of fundamental importance - for the distribution of population within countries; in the organisation of economic production, distribution and exchange; in the structuring of social reproduction and cultural life; and in the allocation and exercise of power. Furthermore, in the course of the present century the number of urban dwellers and level of global urbanisation are destined to increase. Even those living beyond the administrative or functional boundaries of a town or city will have their lifestyle influenced to some degree by a nearby, or even distant, city. The analysis of towns and cities is a central element of all social sciences including geography, which offers a particular perspective on and insight into the urban condition. The principal goal of this third edition of the book remains that of providing instructors and students of the contemporary city with a comprehensive introduction to the expanding field of urban studies. The structure of the first two editions is maintained, with minor amendments. Each of the thirty chapters has been revised to incorporate recent developments in the field. All of the popular study aids are retained; the glossary has been expanded; and chapter references and notes updated to reflect the latest research. This third edition also provides new and expanded discussion of key themes and debates including detailed consideration of metacities, boomburgs, public space, urban sprawl, balanced communities, urban economic restructuring, poverty and financial exclusion, the right to the city, urban policy, reverse migration , and traffic and transport problems. The book is divided into six main parts. Part one outlines the field of urban geography and explains the importance of a global perspective. Part two explores the growth of cities from the earliest times to the present day and examines the urban geography of the major world regions. Part three considers the dynamics of urban structure and land use change in Western cities. Part four focuses on economy, society and politics in the Western city. In part five attention turns to the urban geography of the Third World, where many of the countries experiencing highest rates or urban growth are least well equipped to respond to the economic, social, political and environmental challenge. Finally part six affords a prospective on the future of cities and cities of the future. New to this edition are: further readings based on the latest research; updated data and statistics; an expanded glossary; new key concepts; additional study questions; and a listing of useful websites. The book provides a comprehensive interpretation of the urban geography of the contemporary world. Written in a clear and readable style, lavishly illustrated with more than 80 photographs, 180 figures, 100 tables and over 200 boxed studies and with a plethora of study aids Urban Geography: A Global Perspective represents the ultimate resource for students of urban geography.

AB  - Benchmarking of rail firms has become a matter of substantial interest and many authors have emphasised the importance of transaction costs in regard to assessing the desirability of vertical separation. However, due to data and methodological limitations, previous rail efficiency studies have been unable to explicitly analyse the role that transaction cost measures play in determining the relative efficiency performance of different rail firms or rail systems. This paper incorporates recently produced measures of transaction costs into a two-stage bootstrapped data envelopment analysis (DEA), applied to a sample of 43 Swedish, German and British train operating firms. In the first stage, the number of transaction staff is included as a separate (physical) input within the DEA. This is followed by a second-step Tobit regression which seeks to evaluate the impact of institutional (vertical separation and type of operation), environmental (competition) and transactional (monetary values of transaction costs) factors on technical efficiency. The results of the analysis show that transactional factors are more important in determining technical efficiency than institutional factors and the opening-up of competition.

I interpret the politics of venereal disease (VD) in Seattle during the mid-20th century this way, detecting a series of dualities in key dimensions of the governance of VD, thus extending geographers' work on these concepts. There was an epistemic duality between biomedical and social framings of disease, a simultaneous techne between ascending and descending modes of power; a duality between descriptive and predictive visibilities; an identity paradox around which bodies were at risk; and a duality in ethos between conservative and progressive principles. Interpreting the city politics of public health this way foregrounds this local-state function as an important topic for urban political geography and brings a series of literatures together into conversation that have tended to remain distinct.

While the benefits of a metropolitan decentralization of jobs, housing, and public investment fell to Whites, discrimination in employment and housing trapped African Americans in urban neighborhoods burdened by infrastructure encroachment and divestment. By circa 1970, overt discrimination succumbed to new, racially neutral, legal, and administrative forms, including regional planning processes. Using an environmental racism framework, we show that these new forms reproduced the existing racialized geography by means of new inequalities in representation and transportation service provision. These new regional transportation policies, like those challenged by a 2005 civil rights lawsuit, favored the mobility needs of more affluent suburbanites over those of African American East Bay bus riders. These policies, layered onto an existing racialized geography, reinforced existing inequalities by failing to address racial barriers to opportunity in the built environment.

AB  - Effective management of interfaces between procurement, supply, production and distribution for higher efficiency in the supply chain is an important issue in global manufacturing, where the synchronization of production and transportation planning represents important savings in operational costs. This paper focuses on the synchronization of production planning and transportation planning in a production distribution network, where transportation is subcontracted to a professional transportation enterprise (PTE) for vehicle-hiring. Dynamic and flexible numbers of vehicles are used to cater for fast changing market demands. Thus, the number of vehicles to be hired is viewed from the planning point of view as an operational decision considered simultaneously with production and transportation planning. A mathematical model - SPTP/MTDS - for synchronized production and transportation planning under multiple times and direct shipping strategy (MTDS) is discussed, and a Lagrange relaxation decomposition-based two layer decision procedure (LRD-TLDP) is developed. By introducing artificial decision variables and Lagrange multipliers, SPTP/MTDS is decomposed into a production decision sub-problem (SPTP-PD), and a distribution decision sub-problem (SPTP-DD). A priority-based assignment heuristic and a partial chain-based genetic algorithm are developed to solve SPTP-PD and SPTP-DD, respectively. An illustration of the application of the model in an electronic appliance manufacturing enterprise in China is presented.

AB  - The authors present an integrated GIS tool, Accessibility Analyst, for accessibility analysis in urban transportation planning, built as an extension to the desktop GIS software package, ArcView. Accessibility Analyst incorporates a number of accessibility measures, ranging from catchment profile analysis to cumulative-opportunity measures, gravity-type measures, and utility-based measures, contains several travel-impedance measurement tools for estimating the travel distance, time, or cost by multiple travel modes along actual travel routes, and interoperates with GIS data-management and data-integration, spatial-analysis, network-analysis, surface-modelling, and spatial-visualisation functions. Undertaking accessibility analysis with use of Accessibility Analyst allows the user to take full advantage of a GIS to produce spatial distributions of accessibility over a region. It can be applied to a wide range of issues in urban transportation planning, such as for studies on the relationship between transportation and land use, evaluation of transportation network efficiency, transportation infrastructure planning, and for impact assessments relating to transportation policies.

AB  - The greatest effects of the Federal Aid highway-oriented policy have been social, economic, and environmental. People have been displaced, neighborhoods have been changed, business patterns have been altered, the air has been polluted, and our cities even look very different—primarily as a result of building urban highways and freeways. A study of a freeway under construction in Akron, OH illustrates some of these effects of highway-oriented transportation planning. This particular freeway, although only partially finished, has had numerous social, economic, environmental effects and if finished will have many more. Some of the effects have either tended to perpetuate or aggravate already existing problems, with the result that the overall quality of life has been impacted thereby.

AB  - This paper traces the development of urban transportation planning in the United States, focusing particularly on the influence that three previous conferences - Sagamore (1958), Hershey (1962), and Williamsburg (1965) - have had on the course of this development. Included also are comments on the current state of the art of urban transportation planning and observations as to its future direction. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1934, which authorized the use of "1 Y2 percent funds" for highway planning is identified as the progenitor of urban transportation planning in the U.S., and two reports based on information developed by the highway planning surveys first funded under the 1934 Act, "Toll Roads and Free Roads" (I 939) and "Interregional Highways" (1944), are credited with preparing the ground for much of the urban transportation planning that was to follow. The rapid development of home interview survey techniques in the late 1940's and the full-scale introduction of computer technology in the Detroit Area Transporta- tion Study are noted, as is the work of the National Committee on Urban Transporta- tion, which was initiated in 1954 under sponsorship of the Automotive Safety Foundation. In addition to its substantial technical contributions, the NCUT, through its success in mobilizing the cooperative efforts of virtually every major group concerned with urban transportation, stimulated significant gains in Federal-State-local relationships and paved the way for increased Federal aid to cities in solving their local transportation problems.The impact of the 1956 and 1962 Federal-Aid Highway Acts on urban transpor- tation planning is assessed. The substantial contributions, of the Hartford, Sagamore, Hershey, and Williamsburg conferences are discussed, as are their shortcomings. It is noted that many of our present concerns - environmental impacts, relationships between transportation and land use, need for cooperation among all levels of government, the multi-modal nature of urban transportation, and the need for citizen involvement, to name a few - were incorporated in the provisions of either one or another of the Federal-Aid statutes in the 1950's and '60's or appear in the recommen- dations of the several conferences. That these matters still concern us today is given as evidence that planning has not fully lived up to its promise and responsibility, that more rather than less planning is needed, and that, above all, new leadership to pick up where the old has left off must soon assert itself.

AB  - This paper asserts the continuing need for a long-range component to urban tran- sportation planning, citing particularly the relationships between short- and long-range planning and the dangers of a single-minded concentration on short-range planning. However, the nature of the long-range planning procedure that is required is substan- tively different from that of most extant approaches. Some of the specific requirements and capabilities of a new procedure are described, and existing procedures are compared against these. In the latter part of the paper, some of the elements of a new long-range planning procedure are characterized. It is suggested that the procedure be built around a scenario approach to confronting and bounding future uncertainty. Second, the need to incor- porate financial forecasting in the process is laid out and related to the scenario concept. Third, the need for travel- and impact-forecasting procedures is recognized and a set of input, output and operating requirements for such procedures are specified. It is sug- gested that improved sketch-planning tools may fit the requirements to a large extent. It is also suggested that some procedures or models in the process should be "synthetic" models, not needing calibration for each new application. Finally, a number of require- ments are specified for the display and evaluation of planning proposals from this pro- cedure. A major emphasis is placed here on transparency of the process and respon- siveness to direct intervention by the decision-maker.

AB  - Abstract: This research note provides a unique empirical corroboration of the spatial interdependencies— between prisons and cities—suggested by the critical incarceration literature. Specifically, this research note examines the spatial structure of imprisonment in terms of distances and population flows between prisons and cities. It draws on Georgia Department of Corrections prison admission records, 1990–2006, and analyzes these records using gravity model and principal components analysis approaches. The principal findings are that: (1) prisoners are generally held great distances from their homes; and (2) that prison population flows in the Georgia case are spatially structured by the state’s urban geography.

AB  - In 1993, Jane Jacobs noted that the burgeoning of qualitative approaches to the city evoked 'a methodologically diverse terrain, tenuously drawn together by a reliance on the hermeneutic interpretative process. There are the more familiar, although often marginalized, methods associated with ethnography (such as the in depth interview and participant observation). But increasingly qualitative research includes discursive and representational analyses . . . (Jacobs, 1993: 827). A decade on, these approaches have become mainstream as a 'new' urban geography has embraced and to some extent distanced itself from the interpretative turn (Lees, 2002). Despite the salience of issues of method and methodology and the cultural turn, I find these little discussed in much of the 'new' urban geography that I read these days. In much of the 'new' urban geography, method and methodology are for the most part inconveniences in the world of 'have theory will travel'. By method I mean actual data collection and analysis, and by methodology I mean the bedrock views on the nature of 'reality' (ontology) and knowledge (epistemology) on which methods are founded (Hoggart et al., 2002: 1, 310). 'New' urban geographers are 'users' of qualitative methods, but they seldom outline how they have used these methods or their relationship to the theoretical tracts that they follow. In other instances, they make a case for method and methodology but do not then follow this through in their research and writings. It is in this context that we should perhaps praise quantitative urban geography or urban sociology for its more explicit discussion of methods and data collection. Particularly for students trying to come to terms with the practicalities of 'doing' an urban geography research project this reticence is a real problem....

AB  - This paper is concerned with two developments which place questions about the home center-stage in urban geography, namely the growth of new information and communications technologies (ICT) and the rise of "critical geographies." The paper draws on an empirical in vestigation into British children's domestic use of ICT to move beyond utopian and dystopian hyperbole about the future of the home in the wired world and consider how children's ICT usage is shaped within and reshapes the home environment. In so doing, the paper both broadens and deepens the conceptualization of home in urban geography. In terms of breadth, the analysis illustrates the importance of including children's as well as adults' voices and experiences in studies of domestic life. In terms of depth, it highlights the importance of studying the micro-geographies of home as well as how social relations within the home shape its relation to the wider world.

AB  - This paper argues that before 1978, the Chinese state, a "police state" in the Foucauldian concept of governmentality, aimed at total administration of the economy and society. Central investments determined local spatial development. Economic reforms and administrative decentralization after 1978 allowed local authorities to pursue their own development, leading to many planning problems. To regain control over spatial development, the state now employs urban system planning to regulate development in city regions. The Pearl River Delta Urban System Plan (PRDUSP) is a case in point. To overcome myopic regional development and environmental issues, the PRDUSP lays out a development strategy in which cities are organized into hierarchies around three metropolitan areas, have different functions, and are connected by development and growth axes. Various measures and policies also are recommended. All these suggest that the Provincial Government of Guangdong is searching for a new way of regional governance.

AB  - The quantitative revolution in urban-economic geography flourished in\nthe 1960s at a time when United States domestic policy focused on\ncities, problems of race and poverty, urban renewal and housing, land\nuse and transportation, and environmental pollution. Theoretical work in\nprevious decades in economic geography, spatial analysis, and\nquantitative social science had set the stage for the 1960s. After\ncomputers came along, psychology and economics moved briskly into\ntheoretical areas, with application of quantitative analysis and\nstatistical analysis, while applied mathematics vaguely promised to\nunify theoretical and applied realms of social science. Geography's main\nresearch agendas through the 1950s had been dominated by physical\ngeography and regional analysis, but a new generation of scholars at\nWashington, Northwestern, Michigan, Ohio State, Chicago, Minnesota, and\nPenn State pushed ahead with serious attention to theory development and\nquantification in human geography and statistical cartography. Scholars\nworking on the fringes of other disciplines (e.g., Isard) as well as\ninside geography (e.g., Hagerstrand, Berry, Garrison, Haggett, Chorley,\nHarvey) produced work attractive to the new geography. Mayer and Kohn\nassembled a stimulating reader illustrating theoretical and applied\nurban problems using the new approaches. Despite advances in the 1960s\nand early 1970s, the results of the quantitative revolution in human\ngeography in general-and in urban geography in particular-fell well\nshort of their promise. New ideas, approaches, methods, and problems\nwere never fully exploited or pursued. The reasons are unclear-perhaps\nwe should try to find out why.

AB  - Commuting is the major source of congestion and air pollution in the United States. For almost a decade, urban policy-makers have been concerned about the geographical balance between locations of jobs and housing as a strategy for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in American cities. Despite the popularity and apparent acceptance of the job/housing (J/H) imbalance concept among public policy-makers, little empirical research has been done on the J/H imbalance and how it relates to commuting patterns. This research examines commuting patterns in the Atlanta metropolitan area to determine the extent to which commuting flow volume is the result of an imbalance between the location of home and workplace by using the most sophisticated and largest geographical scale data provided by the 1990 U.S. Census of Transportation Planning Package. This paper uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) to measure the job/housing imbalance within a commuting catchment area having a 7-mile radius from the centroid of each Transportation Analysis Zone. Analysis of variance, stepwise multiple regression and cartographic evidence all confirm the relationship between the imbalance of jobs and housing (J/H) and mean travel time to work. This investigation highlights the fact that the imbalance between the location of jobs and housing is the most important determinant for longer commuting and suggests that higher quality housing growth close to the job-rich communities may benefit the workers to economize the commuting time.

In urban geography, however, there has been little systematic review about the changing nature of socialist cities in an era of rapid globalization. This paper outlines some of the macroeconomic contours that have conditioned national and metropolitan economies since 1989. It then reviews some of the defining features of the socialist city as a backdrop to Warsaw, selected Chinese cities, Ho Chi Minh, and Havana, which are the case studies of this special issue.

AB  - This paper serves as an introduction to this special issue on new developments in urban transportation planning. The papers in this issue highlight how physical mobility is still an essential priority for urban life, but that there are associated costs in the terms of environmental impacts, quality of life and economic performance of cities. Four features of the emerging urban transportation field are identified. The first defining feature is that it is a discipline in the midst of a paradigmatic transition. Second is its overarching aim of achieving sustainable urban mobility as part of a broader effort towards enhancing quality of life in cities. The third feature is the emphasis on collaboration, integration and exchange with other professions and policy sectors. The last distinctive feature is the recognition that urban transportation planning is a communication-oriented activity.

AB  - Three themes that seem likely to be influential in the near future have recently characterized the work of geographers using social theories as the basis of their explanations of urban phenomena. They are (1) the debates about structure and human agency. (2) the claims of feminists about the analytical significance of the social construction of gender roles, and (3) the demand that we now use our social theories more actively to explain experienced reality. In continuing our use of social theory in urban geography, we must prevent its marginalization as one specific substantive topic; the alternative epistemologies of this type of work can guide new interpretations of every substantive issue in urban geography.

AB  - Critical urban geography came to dominate knowledge production in urban geography during the 1990s. This extremely fruitful research program nevertheless faces certain bounds to knowledge production that hinder its ongoing vitality. With respect to conceptual approaches, there has been considerable unbounding from an earlier focus on class and commodity production, recognizing the importance of other axes of social differentiation for urban processes and urban lives. Transcending a bounded conception of cities as objects of inquiry has been slower. With respect to philosophical foundations, strenuously contested philosophical boundaries persist between critical and other urban geography and within critical urban geography. With respect to participation in knowledge production, disciplinary boundaries marginalize knowledge situated in non-White communities and the global south, and critical urban geographers face criticism for failing to broaden knowledge production beyond the Ivory Tower. Notwithstanding a good track record of policy-oriented research, critical urban geographers need to decenter knowledge production, by including disadvantaged communities as full partners in this process. Helen Longino provides critical urban geographers a model for unbounded, nonrelativist and nonmonist knowledge production.

AB  - Theories of place have yet to be developed to explore societal responses to terrorism in the post-9/11 city. Urban geographers have shown the relevance of place for understanding the way people live in cities, including conceptualizations of the way people perceive those places. Geographers working on environmental risk have also conceptualized perception, but only in regard to hazard perception. They have not focused on the city itself as a hazard site, nor have they studied how the contours of place affect hazard perception. Joining urban geography and risk-hazards scholarship, this study argues for a terrorism-place nexus that links terrorism hazard perception to urban place. Using survey and interview data collected from 79 financial service executives in New York City, it will be shown that terrorism has created a place-based ontological dissonance among financial executives, and we speculate about the implications for the city should these workers restore ontological order by moving away their establishments.

AB  - The tradition of American cultural geography was defined by studies of the rural, and in its more prosaic form focused on cataloging and mapping artifacts such as fence posts, barn types, and gravestones in order to delimit culture areas. In contrast, the city was all but ignored, treated as a cultural vacuum, and conceived only as a site of work, production, and economic relations. Hence, the importance of urban spatial science that from the late 1950s formalized that economism as central place theory, or Alonso's map of bid-rent curves, or models of retail location. Even when urban geography began eschewing formal models and theory, turning toward some kind of Marxist approach during the 1970s, the focus on things economic remained, but couched now in a different vocabulary such as rent gap, urban gatekeepers, and uneven development. The economism of spatial science and Marxism could not be sustained, however. Culture had to be let in. From 1990 pressured by outside theoretical developments such as cultural studies, and postmodernism, and changes from inside the discipline such as the rise of the new cultural geography, urban geography finally cracked, explicitly allowing culture in first as a trickle, but by the end of that decade as a flood. Culture had finally left the farm and hit the streets.

AB  - This paper compares the discourse and practices of purportedly collaborative or "partnership" approaches to urban governance in the United States and United Kingdom, as enacted through nationally-directed planning and revitalization programs. The language and underlying principles used to justify and advance such participation initiatives are similar, but differences in state structure in these two national contexts differentiate how and to what effect the engagement of local citizens actually occurs. Governance partnerships are one example of a growing array of policies privileging the local scale, and this "new localism" is commanding attention by U.S. and U.K. urban geographers working a variety of research contexts. Such study of the practices and impacts of a new localism is critically important in an urban geography research agenda, in light of concerns about how ongoing political and economic restructuring affects empowerment and inequity within and between urban areas and among social groups in the city.

AB  - The Year 2000 edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) will contain several new chapters providing guidance to planners on how the HCM can be used in transportation planning models. This paper describes a new speed-flow curve recommended by the new HCM for use in planning models and illustrates the application of this new speed-flow curve in the San Francisco Bay Area. This new speed-flow curve is called the “Akçelik ” curve. Previous research by Dowling, Singh and Cheng demonstrated that the Akçelik speedflow model produces significantly more accurate speed estimates than the standard Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) equation traditionally used in planning models. As has been shown in the wealth of speed-flow data gathered for freeways and other facilities, the Akçelik speed-flow curve is relatively insensitive to increases in traffic volumes until volumes approach capacity. Then the speeds predicted by the Akçelik curve drop fairly rapidly (at the rate predicted by queueing theory). The Akçelik predicted speeds however do not go as low as those predicted by the standard BPR curve for extreme volume/capacity ratios (greater than 2.00 v/c). This is because the Akçelik curve has the property of maintaining a linear increase in link travel times for v/c ratios greater than 1.00. This linear increase in travel times for v/c ratios greater than 1.00 is also in accordance with queueing theory and has been born out in simulation model results. This paper shows a specific application of the Akçelik curve to the San Francisco Bay Area. It was found that the Akçelik curve did not adversely affect equilibrium assignment model run times. The computation times were similar for both the Akçelik and a variation of the BPR currently used by MTC. The Akçelik curve however resulted in a significant (and the authors believe more realistic) lowering of the estimated mean systemwide speed by 3 to 6 mph ( 5 to 10 km/h). The Akçelik curve also results in more realistic assigned traffic volumes that tend to cluster more closely around a v/c ratio of 1.00 with much fewer links with v/c ratios in excess of 1.5 than obtained with traditional BPR curves and their variants.

AB  - This paper shows that robustness analysis is a technique with a potential for aiding decision makers in choosing transportation investment projects. In this paper, it has been demonstrated that it can be successfully used in urban transportation planning in conjunction with urban travel demand software. The robustness analysis procedure emphasizes the need, under conditions of uncertainty, to make early decisions in a time-phased sequence, while preserving future options that currently seem attractive. The results of the robustness analysis from the case study used in this paper indicate that the method is simple to understand, easy to use, minimizes future surprises in terms of expected future events not happening, and provides the flexibility required in typical urban planning problems where decision making is needed to be taken under conditions of uncertainty. A general framework to be used in such cases is proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article offers a critique of the common practice of labeling an institution or group of people as a distinct school of thought, ideology, or methodology, and calls for more open, inclusive, and comparative research in urban geography. The former argument highlights the negative effects of within-group dialogue and its inherent exclusionary tendencies, whereas the latter stresses the role of context and contingency in understanding our cities. Examples are drawn from the experience and characteristics of North American cities to illustrate the crucial importance of national institutions, politics, culture, and geography in shaping those cities, and the challenges involved in writing theory and defining an inclusive research agenda.

AB  - Investors in single-family residential properties have played a crucial role in the United States foreclosure crisis. In this paper, we analyze investor behavior in the diverse urban housing market of Fulton County, Georgia. We examine the composition of buyers of lender-owned properties at two different stages of the foreclosure crisis, and analyze the intrametropolitan geography of investment. Results indicate that large-scale investors are most active in low-value housing submarkets with high poverty and vacancy rates.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the idea of the topological city, both by sharing some observations about the use of topology in critical human geography today and also by demonstrating how different modes of topological analyses of the city may work. This paper suggests that while topology is not new to the social sciences in general or geography in particular, an uptick in interest in topology in the past decade is likely due to its role in the work of Deleuze and Agamben. Topology, I suggest, can help geographers think in creative ways about spatial ontology, thereby offering some insights into the relationship between the subject and the city. I build this argument by discussing the topological workings of three cinematic cities: The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Midnight in Paris (2011), and Inception (2010). [Key words: topology, film, Lacan, subject, spatial theory.

AB  - This progress report examines recent research in the field of Middle East urban studies over the past half decade and is divided thematically into two parts. This first essay, "Middle East Urban Studies: Identity and Meaning," will address the problematic question of the Islamic city model and its meaning. The second essay, "Middle East Urban Studies: Growth, Environment, and Management," to appear in a later issue, will review the research on urban growth in the region, including the work of physical geographers on the urban environment as well as planning and policy perspectives on urban growth management. These essays address both research pertaining to the "Islamic city," which is to be understood as an urban form shaped by Islam, be it located in Indonesia or Jordan, and research pertaining to urban development in the Middle East. Of course, geographers have not reached consensus on the boundaries for this region, but research on urban issues from Morocco in the west to Iran and Turkey in the east has been included. An examination of current research on Middle East urban studies must look beyond geography's borders to include a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary group of Middle East specialists. Such a large net is needed to capture recent research in Middle East urban studies for both practical as well as intellectual reasons. On a practical level, only a handful of European and Anglo-American geographers specialize in the Middle East and its urban issues, and to examine only their work would indeed result in a very brief progress report and a limited view of the subfield. Intellectually, one cannot claim to examine Middle East urban research while ignoring the contributions of Middle East area specialists in fields including urban history, architecture, planning, and anthropology. It should be noted that much of the research on Middle East urban studies is not readily available in English, including the extensive contribution of French scholars, especially on the Maghreb. For readers desiring a record of earlier research on the Middle Eastern city, including citations to works in French and German, I would highly recommend Bonine et al.'s (1994) comprehensive annotated bibliography The Middle Eastern City and Islamic Urbanism, as well as a recent summation by Kopp (1999). This progress report also does not include the body of work produced in Arabic by indigenous scholars of the region, though a review of current articles on human geography in Arabic is available in Falah (1999). Research by Israeli scholars, who tend to publish more frequently in English, is more accessible and is surveyed in these essays. References: Number: 33 SUBJECT(S)
