AB  - In this contribution we describe a method to assess the activity
of vehicles based on airborne image sequences from an infrared camera.
At the resolution of approximately one meter vehicles appear as
elongated spots. In urban areas many additional other objects have the
same property. To discriminate vehicles from these objects we fuse
information from IR-images and vector-maps. Also, evidence from
overlapping areas of frames or an IR-sequence is accumulated in the
scene. We also perform grouping of vehicles into rows along the margins
of the roads. These tasks can be automatically performed by a production
net. The generic productions for grouping become feasible through the
use of map knowledge as context

AB  - The paper assumes that the general relationship between transportation and land-use may be defined in terms of three primary components: (1) Economic activity (i.e. employment), (2) Demographic activity and (3) Transportation facilities. After a brief introductory section, the second section of the paper contains a review of the state of the art models of economic activity location i.e. intra-urban employment forecasting. The third section of the paper contains a review of the state of the art of models of demographic activity location, i.e. intra-urban population forecasting. The final section of the paper begins with a brief description of urban transportation network models. The section and paper are then concluded with a discussion of possible integrated land-use and transportation model packages.

AB  - Agent-based urban traffic service has been looked as an efficient tool for traffic services. However, the main problem is how to build an agent-based model for it. This research presents a multi-agent based demand responsive passenger transport services model, which adopts a multi-agents coordination approach for urban traffic services control. In this paper, we propose a new demand responsive transportation services information intelligent control hybrid model based on multi-agent system that performs the basic interface, planning and supports services for managing different types of demand responsive transportation. In this research, we expose the main features and the behaviors exhibited of the multi-agent system. Based on this model, a simplified multi-agent based demand responsive transportation services system can be developed that is effective for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution.

AB  - This book examines the causes and scale of urban air pollution, identifying who is most at risk, and which particular health risks various pollutants pose. It then considers an effective framework for air quality management. The framework encompasses monitoring networks, emission inventories, air quality standards, modelling, and dissemination of air quality and health information to the public. The author then examines the existing and alternative measures to combat declining air quality. He assesses smog alert systems; the potential for cleaner car and fuel technology; sustainable traffic management and public transport policies; and methods of controlling both industrial and residential emissions. Detailed case studies illustrate the severity and breadth of the problem: from Los Angeles, the first city to suffer serious photochemical smogs, to the dire warning offered by Mexico City; and from London (the city which coined the word "smog') to Athens, pollution phenonemon, the "nefos'. -Publisher

AB  - Creation of living environments has always been led by strong ideas guided by social or environmental objectives. Thus, urban form has in the past, for example, been influenced by safety, order, hygiene and health. During the second half of the twentieth century regeneration of cities has often been guided by notions of local character or genius loci, as a reaction to the destruction and brutal transformation following the Second World War. Climate change and potential higher temperatures have increased concerns about urban heat island effect, which is now probably the single most important factor to consider in the design of cities. This concern, however, should not overtake the need to also create places that are attractive to live in. Urban morphology has proved a successful approach to analyse the characteristics of urban environments and in certain cases to inform urban design guidance; this article will explore the possibility and potential of using morphological techniques to identify the key factors to take into consideration that influence microclimate in cities and inform urban design to provide a maximum cooling effect. This would help to create spaces that are more comfortable for residents. This tentative exploration was initiated as part of the author's work on a case study related to an ongoing research project entitled Urban Rivers and Sustainable Living Agenda (URSULA, www.ursula.ac.uk). Hypothetical parameters related to urban morphology are put forward to analyse the climate performance of different urban forms of a riverside location in Sheffield and the micro-climate data collected there. This will contribute to the ongoing research to identify which urban morphology characteristics have the most significant impact on thermal comfort and how they could be manipulated to mitigate the urban heat island effect. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The rapid growth in urbanization and motorizatiou generally contributes to an urban transportation system that is economically, environmentally and socially unsustainable. The result has been a relentless increase in traffic congestion. Road congestion pricing has been proposed many times as an economic measure to fight congestion in urban traffic, but has not seen widespread use in practice because of Some potential impacts of road pricing remain unknown. The paper first reviews the concept of sustainable transportation system, which should meet the goals of economic development, environmental protection and social justice collectively. And then, based on the characteristics of sustainable transportation system, how congestion pricing can contribute to economic growth, environmental protection and social justice is examined. Examination result shows that congestion pricing is a powerful way to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation system.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - In determining the marginal cost of congestion, economists have traditionally relied upon directly measuring traffic congestion on network links, disregarding any "network effects," since the latter are difficult to estimate. While for simple networks the comparison of the network-based congestion costs with the link-based ones can be done within a theoretical framework, it is important to know whether such network effects in real large-scale networks are quantitatively significant. In this paper we use a strategic transportation planning model (START) to compare marginal congestion costs computed link-by-link with measures taking into account network effects. We find that while in aggregate network effects are not significant, congestion measured on a single link is a poor predictor of total congestion costs imposed by travel on that link. Also, we analyze the congestion proliferation effect on the network to see how congestion is distributed within an urban area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A framework is presented for evaluating the accessibility of urban networks to the transportation needs in urban areas. Accessibility has been defined from the point of view of the network configuration and its relationship to key factors influencing travel demand. The definition is a departure from the traditional methods of accessibility, which primarily describe the interaction of people and places. The definition in this study helps in assessing the interaction between the trip maker and the transportation network, thus helping in an evaluation of the utility of the network to trips in a study region. The methodology uses the computational capabilities of a geographic information system and relates them to the traditional urban transportation planning process. Specific indexes are presented to quantify the accessibility of the network with respect to key factors influencing trip production and attraction. The methodology presented is applicable to the analysis of accessibility of other transportation system networks and to comparisons of the accessibilities of networks of different urban areas.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Several innovative transportation concepts were critical components of the early twentieth-century City Beautiful reconfiguration of built environments: orderly public places, suitable for important civic buildings; clear hierarchies of streets, avenues, and boulevards, organized in rational patterns with orchestrated vistas; and new terminals that housed improved intercity rail facilities and enhanced intracity travel through improved multimodal surface transportation connections. The City Beautiful aesthetic approach to conceiving urban circulation networks was an important and often overlooked contribution to transportation planning, and improving urban transportation was an important goal for City Beautiful reformers. A review of historical planning documents and project descriptions suggests that civic leaders' approaches to improving urban circulation during the City Beautiful era are enduring contributions of the movement's integrated approach to land use and transportation planning and its desire to transform cities into more beautiful places.

The local micrometeorological parameters were measured by an automatic monitoring network; traffic flows and speed were evaluated through a traffic assignment model; motor vehicle composition and hourly distribution throughout the day were determined by the Milan Urban Police measurements; the emission factors were estimated from R. Joumard's experimental data. The calculated hourly concentrations of CO and NO(x) for the average day were compared with those measured at six points for two months, June and September 1989. The normalized mean-square errors obtained for the monthly average hourly concentrations were generally below 0.2 and for monthly average concentrations were below 0.1. The results of the comparison between calculated and measured concentrations suggested the use of APRAC3 for air quality analysis in urban transportation planning in Milan.

AB  - With the rapid population increase and the city's rapid growth in vehicle ownership, urban traffic congestion is becoming worse. The traffic security problem especially is important. This study focuses on urban traffic safety, which is based on analyzing the present situation and the causes of traffic congestion, from the perspective of sustainable transportation, combined with the urban traffic planning theory and traffic intelligent development trends, and puts forward the traffic safety measures. Car networking (Internet of cars) is one part of Internet of things, which is equipped with electronic sensor vehicles for terminals. It connects the vehicle static or dynamic information and the information network platform through the RFID and the wireless data communication technology. Thus, it forms the network that has the function of effective supervision and comprehensive service for all vehicles. This paper uses system analysis method to optimize the urban traffic structure, improve the urban residents of travel efficiency and relieve urban traffic congestion, which is of great significance to improve the urban traffic safety.

AB  - The debate over urban consolidation in Australia has generally ignored the issue of density in the outer urban suburbs of Australian cities, an omission that has led to a serious inconsistency in policy. Governments are emphasising the need for urban intensification in established areas of cities while continuing to allow outer urban areas to be developed at average densities that are among the lowest in the world. Deregulatory policies of the 1990s and an increased reliance on markets have led to increased levels of medium density and high-rise development in Melbourne's inner suburbs and CBD, and broad-scale development in outer suburbs at very low densities. In the process, development companies became the primary determiners of urban form in both inner and outer areas. At the urban fringe, they largely continue to regard intensification, changes to hierarchical retail structures and a reversion to more traditional forms of urban design as a higher commercial risk than proven business-as-usual approaches. This study seeks to place the issue of outer urban densities on the planning agenda of state and local governments. Unless current practices are changed in Melbourne, land set aside in outer urban areas will be used up for housing faster than necessary, and large areas of land squandered. The failure to increase densities in outer urban growth areas will jeopardise compliance with Melbourne 2030 (DOI, 2002a) objectives by preventing the achievement of growth targets in activity centres, and by leading to renewed pressure to remove or substantially alter the Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) and allow further residential development in Melbourne's green bel

AB  - This paper reports on a study carried out to examine human exposure to street-level air pollutants in Sri Lanka and explores the effectiveness of mitigation options. Baseline air pollution and health risk assessment data were collated and a free-ware computer model (Envi-met) was then applied to a selected urban area to test the effectiveness of air pollution mitigation options. Model variables included changes to street vegetation, soil conditions and building geometry. Background aerosol (particulate matter, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide) exposure was found to be significantly different for urban and rural populations. More greenery and reduced vehicular traffic on roads entering main traffic arteries resulted in a decreased particulate matter concentration, whereas the presence of high-rise buildings resulted in an increase. On the basis of the research findings, the paper suggests a 'best case' with a marked decrease in particulate matter concentration compared with the current situation. The possibility of using this methodology in the schematic planning stages of new developments and the regeneration of existing neighbourhoods is highlighted.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - This study examined native bird communities in forest patches across a gradient  of urbanization. We used field data and multivariate statistical techniques to examine the  effects of landscape context, roads, traffic noise, and vegetation characteristics on bird  community composition in the North Carolina Piedmont (U.S.A.). Landscape-level  variables, particularly those related to urbanization, were most important in structuring  forest bird communities. Specifically, we found that road density and amount of urban land  cover were the best predictors of species composition. We found that urban and rural bird  communities were quite distinct from each other. Rural communities had more long-  distance migrants and forest interior species but species richness did not differ between the  communities. Our results suggest some specific guidelines to target bird species of interest  both inside and outside of urban areas. For example, if increasing numbers of migratory  species is of primary concern, then conservation areas should be located outside of urban  boundaries or in areas with low road density. However, if maximizing species richness is  the focus, location of the conservation area may not be as important if the conservation area  is surrounded by at least 50 m of forest habitat in all directions.

AB  - In order to build competence for sustainability analysis and assessment of urban systems, it is seen as essential to build on models representing urban form, landuse and transportation, urban metabolism, as well as ecological processes. This type of analysis of interacting sub-systems requires an advanced model integration platform, yet open for learning and for further development. Moreover, since the aim is to increase urban experience with ecosystem management in the wide sense, the platform needs to be open and easily available, with high visualisation capacity. For this purpose, the LEAMmodel was applied to the Stock- holm Region and two potential future scenarios were developed, resulting from alternative policies. The scenarios differed widely and the dense urban development of Scenario Compact could be visualised, destroying much of the Greenstructure of Stockholm, while Scenario Urban Nature steered the development more to outer suburbs and some sprawl. For demon- stration of the need for further development of biodiversity assessment models, a network model tied to a prioritised ecological profile was applied and altered by the scenarios. It could be shown that the Greenstructure did not support this profile very well. Thus, there is a need for dynamic models for negotiations, finding alternative solutions and interacting with other models. The LEAM Stockholm case study is planned to be further developed, to interact with more advanced transport and land use models, as well as analysing energy systems and urban water issues. This will enable integrated sustainability analysis and assessment of complex urban systems, for integration in the planning process in Stockholm as well as for comparative sustainability studies between different cities, with the goal to build more sustainable urban systems and to increase urban experiences in ecosystem management.

AB  - The diversity and complexity of human settlements is reflected in the range of ways we try to understand them. The richness of subject matter presented by cities has given rise to an equal richness in methods of investigation. Even within a single field such as urban morphology, there are different approaches with different terms of reference. The challenge raised by the diversity is not how to select between the different views but how to combine and co-ordinate them. The purpose of this paper is to undertake an initial critical analysis of different approaches to urban morphology in an effort to meet that challenge. The first aim is to identify the range of different phenomena taken as the object of urban morphological enquiry. The second is to identify an aspect that is common to all the approaches and that can be used as a reference key to co-ordinate different views in a rigorous way. The ultimate goal is a composite view in which the different approaches support each other to provide a better understanding of human settlements. © International Seminaron Urban Form, 2009.

AB  - Accelerated population growth in general and an increasing expanse and intensity of metropolitan development through- out the world have focused attention on urban transportation and growth management. The high cost of urban highways and mass transit systems, coupled with the necessity of guiding private use of land toward acceptable levels of rational development, have resulted in various urban investment strategies. Among these, the concept of joint development of transportation facilities and high activity nodes has emerged as a promising solution to problems of overcrowding and congestion in major cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Such integrated public and private investment not only tends to maximize the cost effectiveness of required facilities, but offers opportunities benefit of the public at large and as an incentive for risk capital investment. A comprehensive study was undertaken by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning of Texas A&M University to examine the requisites of effective joint development in selected metropolitan areas, including Toronto and Montreal, Canada; Washington, DC, San Francisco and Atlanta in the USA; and Paris, France. In all instances, it was found that fixed guideway rapid transit had a discernible, positive impact on urban growth and intra-urban transportation, opportunities provided versely, it was confirmed that effective application of this strategy required the pre-existence of economic viability in general, and in the specific transportation for imaginative growth management and was, indeed, a major inducement for private investment. Con- corridor selected in particular. Given these requisites, several determinants can be identified that stand out consistently as preconditions to success or failure where they are absent. They include integrated public-private planning and construction; pedestrian flow orienta- tion with respect to station entrances and exits: complete control of land ownership; attractive terms and conditions for lease and related arrangement; zoning stability; availability of infrastructure when needed; trade area conditions; an aes- thetically pleasing environment with appropriate architectural and landscape architectural treatment of all facilities and grounds; a cooperative, constructive attitude by all parties. Under these conditions, multi-modal transportation systems and high-intensity land development have an excellent chance to succeed.

Analyses of bicycling and walking are also included for a comparison of motorized modes with human propulsion systems. For each system the energy required to manufacture a vehicle, the energy required to manufacture the guideway, and energy of operation are estimated. The average energy consumed per available seat-mile is calculated to compare the system when they are operating at capacity. An example containing assumed average occupancy levels gives a more realistic comparision on the basis of energy consumed per passenger-mile.

AB  - Debates on the urban form have become strongly polarized between the advocates and opponents of the compact and of the dispersed or "sprawled" city. In this paper we argue that this may be the result of an excessive concentration on the study of the American experience and the neglect of other urban contexts, and examine the recent process of urban growth against the background of urban compactness and extreme densification represented by the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). The comparison of two detailed land-cover maps of 1993 and 2000 shows a progressive transformation in the traditional urban character of the region. Lower urban densities, high losses of non-urban land covers, depopulation of the metropolitan inner core, an increasing importance of single housing or the expansion of transportation infrastructures confirm the generalization of the dispersed urban model. However, the presence of numerous medium sized towns has also proved to be a deterrent of excessive dispersion. In conclusion, polycentric metropolitan areas such as the BMR may be more adjusted to absorb the negative effects of dispersion than monocentric areas. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is concerned with patterns of urban development and their evaluation, prediction, and prescription using mathematical models. A utility maximizing model which incorporates diversity of benefits within each allocation option is introduced. This diversity also affects dispersal of activities among zones and is related to cost differences and trip distributions between zones. The degree of diversity is affected by the influence of the different parties in the location decision process, by different levels of planning control, and by different transport and communications futures, and the consequences of these factors on patterns of development and on utility are examined.

AB  - Cities play a vital role in promoting economic growth and prosperity. The develop- ment of cities largely depends upon their physical, social, and institutional infrastruc- ture. In this context, the importance of intraurban transportation is paramount. This article provides an overview of urban transport issues in India. Rather than covering every aspect of urban transportation, it primarily focuses on those areas that are important from a policy point of view. The article first reviews the trends of vehicular growth and availability of transport infrastructure in Indian cities. This is followed by a discussion on the nature and magnitude of urban transport problems such as congestion, pollution, and road accidents. Building on this background, the article proposes policy measures to improve urban transportation in India. Indian cities cannot afford to cater only to private cars and two-wheelers and there has to be a general recognition that policy should be designed in such a way that it reduces the need to travel by personalized modes and boosts public transport sys- tem. This requires both an increase in quantity as well as quality of public transport and effective use of demand as well as supply-side management measures. At the same time, people should be encouraged to walk and cycle and government should support investments that make cycling and walking safer.

AB  - The distribution of mercury in sediments of the Patos Lagoon estuary and nearby coastal marine deposits has been investigated for the period 1998-2008. Polluted urban soils and coastal reclamation fills are the principal sources of high mercury concentrations for shallow estuarine sediments. The shallow sediments that form near the urban area enter the navigation canal and are transported into the ocean. The mercury concentration in sediments of the navigation canal has considerably increased since 2004, due to intense reconstruction activity in the urban area. Periodic dredging of the canal strengthens the preconditions for coastal marine sediment contamination by mercury. However, this does not occur because the resuspended dredged sediments are significantly diluted by natural suspended particulate matter.

AB  - A major problem addressed during the preparation of spatial development plans relates to the accessibility to facilities where services of general interest such as education, health care, public safety, and justice are offered to the population. In this context, planners typically aim at redefining the level of hierarchy to assign to the urban centers of the region under study (with a class of facilities associated with each level of hierarchy) and redesigning the region's transportation network. Traditionally, these two subjects - urban hierarchy and transportation network planning - have been addressed separately in the scientific literature. This paper presents an optimization model that simultaneously determines which urban centers and which network links should be promoted to a new level of hierarchy so as to maximize accessibility to all classes of facilities. The possible usefulness of the model for solving real-world problems of integrated urban hierarchy and transportation network planning is illustrated through an application to the Centro Region of Portugal. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Urban transportation system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops and influenced by transportation, social, economical, and environmental factors. Conventional transportation modeling approaches are unsuitable to simulate and evaluate its performance. This paper presents a system dynamics approach based on the cause-and-effect analysis and feedback loop structures. The proposed SD model comprises 7 submodels: population, economic development, number of vehicles, environmental influence, travel demand, transport supply, and traffic congestion. The model runs in Vensim PLE software using the data from Dalian, China. The coefficient of the intervention policy of vehicle ownership is chosen as the control variable for simulation, and the impacts of different policy scenarios on urban development and transportation system are analyzed. It suggests that Dalian should restrict the total number of vehicles to improve the sustainability of transportation system.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

AB  - It is well-known that big cities suffer from traffic congestion and all consequences that come with it. This is an especial problemin cities in developing countrieswhere the public transportation systemis not reliable andwhere the fleet of vehicles tend to be old thus increasing air pollution. There is no turnkey solu- tion for this problem, but several improvements have been suggested in the field of urban and traffic management, provided an information system is built which can provide information to both the traffic experts and the user of the system. Such an information system has to incorporate features of an ITS and an ATIS. An un- derline assumption is that there is a simulation model to provide certain kinds of information in forecast. This paper discusses the model and implementation of such an information systemwhich is based on a microscopic model of simulation and on cellular automata and is implemented using agent technologies and with a bottom-up philosophy in mind. We give here an overview of the project, the details of the modules (data, simulation, driver and information/visualization), as well as discuss an application of the simulation tool.

While it is recognized that energy is not yet as decisive a factor in the determination of household and firm locational patterns as other factors such as accessibility and time costs, the model attempts to resolve land allocation problems by means of minimizing total transportation energy costs alone. Such an analysis may serve as a benchmark against which other policies and their energy repercussions could and should be measured.

AB  - In recent years, the use of visioning as a tool for developing regional land use scenarios has become rather common. Typically, visioning is performed in a cooperative of business owners, the community, and local officials, and results in a set of regional development goals for the region’s future. This is a very different approach to thinking about a region’s future than predictive models calibrated on historical data. In general, visions are created on the basis of stakeholder preferences. Consequently, direct comparisons of results for the two methods are not really relevant. However, it is important to understand how the two approaches differ and that both offer their own relative advantages from a planning perspective. In an effort to better appreciate what each approach offers, this paper compares and contrasts these two methods, featuring the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as a case study.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.

AB  - Ambient concentrations of pollutants are correlated with emissions, but the contribution to ambient air quality of on-road mobile sources is not necessarily equal to their contribution to regional emissions. This is true for several reasons such as the distribution of other pollution sources and regional topology, as well as meteorology. In this paper, using a dataset from a travel demand model for the Sacramento metropolitan area for 2005, regional vehicle emissions are disaggregated into hourly, gridded emission inventories, and transportation-related concentrations are estimated using an atmospheric dispersion model. Contributions of on-road motor vehicles to urban air pollution are then identified at a regional scale. The contributions to ambient concentrations are slightly higher than emission fractions that transportation accounts for in the region, reflecting that relative to other major pollution sources, mobile sources tend to have a close proximity to air quality monitors in urban areas. The contribution results indicate that the impact of mobile sources on PM10 is not negligible, and mobile sources have a significant influence on both NOx and VOC pollution that subsequently results in secondary particulate matter and ozone formation. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Much of the current concern with sustainable transportation focuses on the alleged ills of the automotive industry. Global warming and a range of detrimental impacts are attributed to increased atmospheric concentrations of automotive emissions. Within Canada, various groups have attempted to achieve consensus on a variety of policies and measures intended to reduce automobile dependence. This paper is based on the premise that, from the standpoint of sustainability, the key goals for urban transportation involve first, reducing total vehicle-km of travel by altering both average trip lengths and modal split and, second, improving fuel efficiency by technological means. After examining the range of policy instruments available to achieve these goals, the highest priority policies are identified in terms of their likelihood of moving Canadian cities to more sustainable forms of land use and transportation development.

Urban planning can influence urban form, but due to practicality needs to focus on a few indicators out of the numerous indicators which are available. The present study analyses urban form with respect to landscape metrics and population-related indicators for 231 European cities. Correlations and factor analysis identify the most relevant urban form indicators. Furthermore, a cluster analysis groups European cities according to their urban form. Significant differences between the clusters are presented. Results indicate that researchers, European administration and urban planners can select few indicators for analysing urban form due to strong relationships between single indicators. But they should be aware of differences in urban form when comparing European cities or working on planning policies for the whole of Europe. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed model is simulated under several scenarios using historical data of transportation and industrial sectors in Tehran. Policies are categorized as: (1) road construction, (2) technology improvement in fuel and automotive industries, (3) traffic control plans, (4) development of public transportation infrastructures. The results show effectiveness of the proposed policies. In this case, technology improvement in fuel and automotive industries and development of public transportation infrastructures are more effective policies in order to reduce air pollution. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Trips involving more than one stop before returning home comprise a quarter to a third of all urban travel. A high degree of similarity exists in the pattern of flow for various trip purposes because of a common dependence on the spatial arrangement of activities. Linkages among activity on a single trip, stemming from a savings in transport inputs, are also related to the areal pattern of activities and most frequently involve clustered business and commercial land uses. Several sections of the Lansing metropolitan area (used in the empirical analysis) have strong local linkages among trip purposes, but the city also has a considerable volume of spatially diffused multiple-purpose trip flows.

AB  - The extent of the urban area, the local emission density, and the temporal pattern in the releases govern the local contribution to air pollution levels in urban environments. However, meteorological conditions also heavily affect the actual pollution levels as they govern the dispersion conditions as well as the transport in and out of the city area. The building obstacles play a crucial role in causing generally high pollutant levels in the urban environment, especially inside street canyons where the canyon vortex flow governs the pollution distribution. Of the pollutants dominating urban air pollution climates, particulate pollution in general together with gaseous and particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals are those where further field measurements, characterization and laboratory studies are urgently needed in order to fully assess the health impact on the urban population and provide the right basis for future urban air pollution management.

AB  - A mathematical model is presented for the determination of human exposure to ambient air pollution in an urban area. The main objective was to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of average exposure of the urban population to ambient air pollution in different microenvironments with reasonable accuracy, instead of analysing in detail personal exposures for specific individuals. We have utilised a previously developed modelling system for predicting the traffic flows and emissions, emissions originating from stationary sources, and atmospheric dispersion of pollution in an urban area. A model was developed for combining the predicted concentrations, information on people's activities (such as the time spent at home, in the workplace and at other places of activity during the day) and location of the population. Time-microenvironment activity data for the working-age population was obtained from the EXPOLIS study (air pollution distributions within adult urban populations in Europe). Information on the location of homes and workplaces was obtained from local municipalities. The concentrations of NO2 were modelled over the Helsinki Metropolitan Area for 1996 and 1997. The computed results were processed and visualised using the geographical information system (GIS) MapInfo. The utilisation of the modelling system has been illustrated by presenting numerical results for the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The results show the spatial and temporal (diurnal) variation of the ambient air NO2 concentrations, the population density and the corresponding average exposure. The model developed has been designed to be utilised by municipal authorities in urban planning, e.g., for evaluating the impacts of traffic planning and land use scenarios. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Based on the loudness of different soundscape elements perceived on site, soundscapes were analysed in a multi-functional urban area in Rostock, Germany. The aim was to examine how urban soundscape composition changes spatiotemporally at different levels over a relatively large scale, and how soundscape perception is related to the underlying landscape. The results show that although anthropogenic sounds (anthrophony) dominated urban soundscape both spatially and temporally, certain biological sounds (biophony) and geophysical sounds (geophony), especially bird song, also played a significant role. Urban soundscapes showed diverse spatiotemporal patterns. Spatial variation of urban soundscape patterns was explained by underlying landscape characteristics, while temporal variation was mainly driven by urban activities, among which human activities were the major component. It is demonstrated that the thematic soundscape mapping techniques developed in this study is an effective tool. Landscape composition and configuration indicators could affect soundscape perception significantly, among which normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and landscape shape index (LSI) are the two most important predictors. The results highlight the importance of introducing more natural sounds into urban environments to achieve "noise control" through an ecological urban/landscape planning process. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - North American cities have undergone dramatic changes over the last century. Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005–2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption.

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

Metropolitan areas that exhibited higher levels of urban sprawl, or sprawl-like urban morphologies, generally exhibited higher concentrations and emissions of air pollution and CO2 when con- trolling for population, land area, and climate.

The persistent trials and errors in the urban public\ntransportation policy resulted to the introduction of the three wheeler\nvehicular mode of public transportation in the metropolis of about 11\nmillion people.\nSince the vehicles hit the streets of Lagos about two years ago, many\nunder-employed graduates were put in business, many un-educated citizens\nincapacitated by poverty-stricken background got something to do, while\nshort-distanced commuters, who hitherto had made their trip on foot or\nmotorcycle had relief. These gains were, however, over shadowed by the\nrelatively small size of the vehicle (officially three passengers full\ncapacity) that made it uncomfortable for many passengers, its fragile\nnature inability to withstand the restlessness and aggressive nature of\nLagos commuters, emissions from within and other vehicles, engine noise\nfrom within and other vehicles continuously give passengers persistent\ndiscomfort. More importantly, the adoption of the mode for public\ntransport with its attendant limited occupancy restraint design put many\npassengers at risk and made the mode unsafe at any speed.\nThis paper examines the policy background of the introduction of this\nmode of public transportation in the most populated city in the African\ncontinent and discusses in details the transport-related pollution\nimplications of its use on the environment and the urban passengers and\npopulation. The overall concern of the government driven and dominant\ncontrol of public transportation systems in rapidly growing Nigerian\ncities is highlighted and the some policy suggestion advanced towards\nensuring a more effectively sustained public transport systems and urban\nenvironment.

AB  - The urban transportation planning process is buffeted by one of the paradoxes of American public opinion. The public decries urban sprawl, but craves the comfort and convenience of the auto and larger homes and lots. Typically, planners and policymakers are unwilling to confront the contradiction between what the public says and what it does. But “new urbanists” are intent on changing preferences and behavior, and they have captured the urban transportation planning process in places like Portland. Portland’s Year 2000 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) for a forecast year of 2020 illustrates the tension in the urban transportation planning process of balancing accommodation of powerful decentralizing trends and the advocacy of programs to reverse those trends.

AB  - A large number of techniques for conserving energy in urban passenger transport are described. A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents the outcome of research conducted in the city of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Analysis of recorded meteorological elements shows that the atmosphere of the area favors the accumulation of air pollutants. Dustfall rates were measured at 22 stations in different districts. High rates of dustfall were found in all districts, with maximum recorded values in central urban and industrial districts. Collected samples were analyzed to determine the causes of these excessive precipitations. Suspended particulate matter and other pollutants were found to exceed air quality standards set to meet environmental requirements. Carbon monoxide was found to exceed the air quality standard of 9 μL/L. Concentrations of photochemical oxidants indicated the possibility of Los Angeles-type photochemical smog formation. Geographic distribution of pollutant concentrations and chemical constituents of particulates were found to be influenced by both manmade and natural causes. Results are discussed and several conclusions are given.

AB  - Transportation and land use interact with each other in a mutual and dynamic manner. Changes in transportation systems create new accessibility levels that influence land-use patterns. Land-use changes in turn modify activity and travel patterns, which induce further changes in transportation systems. In addition, transportation and land-use interaction is influenced by other ongoing dynamic processes in an urban system. Many theories and models have been developed to improve our understanding of the mutual effects between transportation and land use. However, it remains a challenge to identify and forecast transportation and land-use interaction in contemporary urban areas since the interplays between different processes occur at various spatial and temporal scales and it is difficult to isolate the effect of one process from the others. Due to the desire of implementing innovative transportation and/or land-use policies to help achieve sustainable development, transportation and land-use interaction are likely to continue receiving attention from policymakers. Although we may not be able to answer all of the questions related to transportation and land-use interaction in the near future, recent progress in related theoretical work, methodological improvements, and technological advancements have shown promising potential of gaining further understanding of this subject.

AB  - Improved criteria are necessary to aid in determining awards of federal funds for metropolitan transit projects. Commuting is the main use for public transit. Thus a prima- ry objective of an urban transit system should be to provide a flexible and balanced set of options to the workers in the metropolitan area for their journey to work. This paper discusses various facets of an appropriate balance among the three modes: rapid rail, bus, and automobile. Three cities are selected for further analysis: Baltimore, Kansas City, and Phoenix. These cities represent different stages in economic-transportation develop- ment, and also present different spatial patterns of residence and employment. The appli- cability of rapid rail transit to each city is examined in view of central city worker con- centration and recent trends.

AB  - Rome, Italy's largest city, has about 3 million inhabitants and covers an urban surface area of 360 sq. km. The insect fauna of this area has been the object of research since the second half of the 19th century. Rome is one of those rare cases in Europe where urban expansion in the last century took place on an area, the 'Campagna Romana', which had been practically uninhabited. A study based on a critical revision of the entomological literature published from 1850 to nowadays, together with other unpublished material has evidenced the presence and the microdistribution of about 5200 species belonging to not less than 356 families. Such information, although so vast, is however still incomplete. Documentation for groups such as Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Macrolepidoptera and Hymenoptera Aculeata, which have traditionally been studied by local entomologists is quite complete, but groups such as Collembola, Psocoptera. Phtirapiera, Thysanoptera and Homoptera are still poorly documented. From a preliminary global analysis of data collected, it can be clearly seen that from the end of the 40's there has been a general impoverishment of the species, particularly in those communities linked to wetlands. Aspects linked to urbanization which have influenced, or influence the insect fauna are also evidenced: 1) environmental modifications which took place in the last one hundred years on a local scale (the rapid urbanization of the city from 1870 onwards due to its role as capital of Italy) and on a regional scale (land reclamation and progressive human impact on the 'Campagna Romana', modifications to the flow of the fiver Tiber and its tributaries, chemical control of culicides as vectors of malaria); 2) the presence of large central green areas and greenways (historical villas and archaeological areas) and their role in the conservation of biodiversity.

AB  - This work extends the conceptual argument for the use of ellipses to portray activity spaces and offers one example of how the ellipse construct can be used to analyze urban travel characteristics, based on observed trip making behavior and socio-economic variables. A problem in characterizing activity spaces has been in integrating the time and space dimensions into the same analytical framework while maintaining an understandable graphical representation of the space-time geographies envisioned by Hagerstrand and others. The ellipse allows this, as well as providing several quantifiable measures to be used for analyzing and characterizing activity spaces and urban travel behavior. In the current application, analysis of variance is used to analyze the resulting elliptic variables of 653 travelers. The results indicate that home location and house- hold size are important factors in determining activity space characteristics and that the ellipse variables provide a different and useful approach for understanding urban travel behavior.

AB  - This paper examines the role of land readjustment (LR) projects in suburban planning and land development in a case-study area in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. LR projects have been the most important planning tool in Japan, yet the results of their use to develop over 30 per cent of Japanese urban areas have been little examined. The paper challenges the conventional wisdom that LR projects are an effective means of preventing urban sprawl. Through interviews with local planners and participants in projects, and a detailed GIS mapping of land-use change and infrastructure development in the case-study area, the research presents an in-depth study of the use of LR for suburban land development, and a dose look at the patterns of urbanisation on the fringe of Japan's most dynamic metropolitan region. It appears that while LR projects do clearly prevent sprawl within the project areas themselves, they tend to exacerbate problems of sprawl at the scale of the city and region

This study uses a system dynamics approach to develop a model for predicting and interpreting such results. Viable economic development and population booming in the city result in a massive demand on freight and passenger vehicles. A basic feedback structure of the model which links private vehicle stock to demographic, economic, environmental and infrastructure sectors is presented. The model serves as an experimental platform and is used to explore the dynamics of urban vehicle market as well as possible environmental consequences. Simulation run of the model over the next 20 years is carried out. The dynamic results of vehicle stocks and their environmental implications are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, the use of visioning processes and scenario-planning tools for developing regional land-use scenarios has become rather common. Typically, visioning is performed as a cooperative, inclusive process among business owners, community residents, interest groups, and local officials, and results in broad goals and principles which can guide future policies and plans. This is a very different approach than a land-use modeling process, which is typically generated by technical experts and results in a set of probable future trends and indicators which can guide the implementation of growth management strategies. The scenario-planning tools typically used for visioning processes are designed to generate and compare potential and preferred future development scenarios based on stakeholder values and preferences, whereas land-use models are used to predict likely future development patterns based on mathematical equations, reflecting historical trends, and market forces. Consequently, direct comparisons of results for the two methods are not really relevant. However, it is important to understand how the two approaches differ and that both offer their own relative advantages from a planning perspective. In an effort to better appreciate what each approach offers, this paper compares and contrasts these two methods, featuring the Austin metropolitan statistical area as a case study. The preferred vision, produced by the Envision Central Texas organization, offers the greatest potential for public involvement in identifying regional development goals for the future. The land-use models have a strong theoretical foundation and allow for interactions with a transportation model. Moreover, the land-use models have the potential to identify key strategies that can be used in achieving the region's goals. Thus, the combination of these two approaches seems to offer the greatest opportunities for planners to achieve a future that accommodates all stakeholders.  2008 ASCE.

AB  - An analysis of data of the past few decades from cities around the world indicates that history is repeating itself. Although there are significant differences in socioeconomic and technological characteristics among these cities, a remarkable similarity exists in trends in urban transportation. The current growth in the use of automobiles in many cities of developing countries follows similar trends experienced in the United States and other developed countries several decades earlier. Even though there is much awareness and knowledge about sustainability, private vehicle ownership, and use continue to grow at an increasing pace with rising personal incomes and desires to experience faster and more reliable transportation technology. Urban density, expressed in number of people and/or jobs per unit of land, is the key indicator of the level of automobile ownership and use, and of associated parameters of sustainability. As personal incomes rise, choice of residential and job location increases, causing a decrease in urban density and affecting the relative use of private transportation and public transit. There are policy options related to land use, pricing, and technological factors that can have far reaching influence on the long-term sustainability of urban-transportation systems around the world. The basic implication of the analysis is that urban-transportation sustainability can be greatly enhanced if there are profound changes in urban structures and activities that can slow or reverse the growth in the use of private automobiles and can make transit and other modes attractive and viable.

AB  - This paper traces the development of urban transportation planning in the United States, focusing particularly on the influence that three previous conferences - Sagamore (1958), Hershey (1962), and Williamsburg (1965) - have had on the course of this development. Included also are comments on the current state of the art of urban transportation planning and observations as to its future direction. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1934, which authorized the use of "1 Y2 percent funds" for highway planning is identified as the progenitor of urban transportation planning in the U.S., and two reports based on information developed by the highway planning surveys first funded under the 1934 Act, "Toll Roads and Free Roads" (I 939) and "Interregional Highways" (1944), are credited with preparing the ground for much of the urban transportation planning that was to follow. The rapid development of home interview survey techniques in the late 1940's and the full-scale introduction of computer technology in the Detroit Area Transporta- tion Study are noted, as is the work of the National Committee on Urban Transporta- tion, which was initiated in 1954 under sponsorship of the Automotive Safety Foundation. In addition to its substantial technical contributions, the NCUT, through its success in mobilizing the cooperative efforts of virtually every major group concerned with urban transportation, stimulated significant gains in Federal-State-local relationships and paved the way for increased Federal aid to cities in solving their local transportation problems.The impact of the 1956 and 1962 Federal-Aid Highway Acts on urban transpor- tation planning is assessed. The substantial contributions, of the Hartford, Sagamore, Hershey, and Williamsburg conferences are discussed, as are their shortcomings. It is noted that many of our present concerns - environmental impacts, relationships between transportation and land use, need for cooperation among all levels of government, the multi-modal nature of urban transportation, and the need for citizen involvement, to name a few - were incorporated in the provisions of either one or another of the Federal-Aid statutes in the 1950's and '60's or appear in the recommen- dations of the several conferences. That these matters still concern us today is given as evidence that planning has not fully lived up to its promise and responsibility, that more rather than less planning is needed, and that, above all, new leadership to pick up where the old has left off must soon assert itself.

The empirical component begins with a contemporary (potential) racial flashpoint as a catalyst for unpacking the city’s urban morphological transformations since the late 18th century. The Lexington case illustrates the importance of particular understandings of urban sociospatial form as key in shaping racialized landscapes in general. It also contributes to a richer understanding of Southern city form and development, and ultimately holds forth the possibilities for intervening in urban sociospatial processes through the cultural landscape to chal- lenge the always-reformulating processes of racial formation.

AB  - North American cities have been evolving from monocentric to polycentric metropolitan regions, with multiple concentrations of activities occurring outside of traditional urban cores. This new urban structure, with multiple urban "activity centers," has profound influence on the functioning of cities, particularly transportation systems. This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incorporates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed methodology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria. The impact of these "transportation activity centers" on Philadelphia's travel patterns is explored.

AB  - Urban governments show considerable interest in formulating policies for a more sustainable transportation sector. In Australia, despite the Commonwealth Government Ecologically Sustainable Development ~ESD! Transport Working Group making over 40 recommendations for more sustainable urban transportation a decade ago, a recent Institution of Engineers Australia, Transport Panel found little progress with transportation indicators of sustainability and appropriate analytical techniques. A review of the international literature is made to determine definitions of a sustainable urban transportation and land use system, and objectives that would form the basis for determining suitable indicators of performance. Drawing on hierarchical diagrams from decision theory, we show the link between higher-level policy objectives for sustainability and lower-order actions, measurable attributes, and performance indicators. The analytical framework for sustainable urban transportation analysis includes descriptive statistics—exploratory and graphical methods, spatial mapping, spatial statistics ~to identify geographical patterns and to identify outliers in the data!, regression analysis, travel preference functions based on Stouffer’s intervening opportunity model, and linear programming. These analytical techniques are illustrated with examples of travel and urban form in Sydney using data from the Census of Population and Housing, 1961–1996. The need for geographically based indicators and transportation and land use policies is emphasized.

AB  - Interest in sustainable &ldquo;green&rdquo; practices continues to rise throughout the United States, particularly in relation to green building. Currently, programs such as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design and Green Globes assess the ecoefficiency of a variety of building types and communities. The existing rating systems include some aspects of transportation; however, currently there is no program that focuses on transportation investments. In addition, there is little documentation of the development of these rating systems. This research develops a methodology for rating systems and applies the system to transportation investments, specifically urban corridors. Urban transportation corridors serve to illustrate the concepts because of their essential role of providing mobility and interaction between and within communities. The end product, sustainable corridor rating system (SCRS), is intended to alter the behavior of transportation practitioners and induce sustainable transportation practices by defining a methodology for developing green rating systems. In addition, the methodology defined in this research can be applied universally to the development of green rating systems similar to SCRS.

The papers in this issue highlight how physical mobility is still an essential priority for urban life, but that there are associated costs in the terms of environmental impacts, quality of life and economic performance of cities. Four features of the emerging urban transportation field are identified. The first defining feature is that it is a discipline in the midst of a paradigmatic transition. Second is its overarching aim of achieving sustainable urban mobility as part of a broader effort towards enhancing quality of life in cities. The third feature is the emphasis on collaboration, integration and exchange with other professions and policy sectors. The last distinctive feature is the recognition that urban transportation planning is a communication-oriented activity.

AB  - The development of the nervous system takes place in two main steps: first an extensive preliminary network is formed and then it is pruned and trimmed to establish the final form. This refinement is achieved by mechanisms that include cell death, selective growth and loss of neurites and the stabilization and elimination of synapses. The focus of this review is on selective neurite retraction during development, with particular emphasis on the role of electrical activity. In many developing vertebrate and invertebrate neurones, the frequency and duration of ongoing impulse activity determine the final arborizations and the pattern of connections. When impulse traffic is silenced, axons fail to retract branches that had grown to inappropriate destinations in the mammalian visual system, cerebellum and neuromuscular junctions. Similarly, in crustaceans, Drosophila melanogaster and leeches, refinements in axonal morphology during development are influenced by impulse activity. From experiments made in culture, it has been possible to mimic these events and to show a clear link between the density of voltage-activated calcium channels in a neurite and its retraction following stimulation. The distribution of these calcium channels in turn is determined by the substratum with which the neurites are in contact or by the formation of synapses. Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium entry into the growth cone leads to collapse by disruption of actin filaments. One candidate for coupling membrane events to neurite retraction is the microfilament-associated protein gelsolin which, in its calcium-activated state, severs actin filaments. Open questions that remain concern the differential effects of activity on dendrites and axons as well as the mechanisms by which the growth cone integrates information derived from stimuli in the cell and in the extracellular environment.

In this paper, it has been demonstrated that it can be successfully used in urban transportation planning in conjunction with urban travel demand software. The robustness analysis procedure emphasizes the need, under conditions of uncertainty, to make early decisions in a time-phased sequence, while preserving future options that currently seem attractive. The results of the robustness analysis from the case study used in this paper indicate that the method is simple to understand, easy to use, minimizes future surprises in terms of expected future events not happening, and provides the flexibility required in typical urban planning problems where decision making is needed to be taken under conditions of uncertainty. A general framework to be used in such cases is proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - An interdisciplinary research program of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, has investigated the potential impact of substituting telecommunications and computer technology for certain forms of urban transportation [1]. Emphasis has been placed upon the use of these technologies to alleviate the massive twice-daily peak commuting loads imposed upon most major American cities. The primary means by which these technologies will be used is to allow "information industry" workers to perform their jobs at work centers scattered throughout each city, close to their homes, rather than commuting long distances to work. A basic premise is made that this reorientation of urban work patterns will not occur unless the technological substitutes can be shown to be both economical and effective. The results of a study of a major insurance firm located in the Los Angeles central business district are presented. The study evaluated the present transportation patterns, population distribution, and business contact requirements of a major administrative division of this firm. These commuting and communicating patterns were then used as the basis for assessing the feasibility of the use of various levels of telecommunications and computer technology for allowing the substitution for commuting by "telecommuting." Alternative telecommuting network designs were formulated and evaluated with respect to their ability to facilitate current work functions. Costs of network installation and operation were compared with the present costs of commuting. It is concluded that present communications and computer technology, in terms of "off-the-shelf" hardware and services, can offer an economical substitute for commuting.

AB  - The NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model was applied to the Biliu River catchment, northern China, to estimate the carrying capacity of the water resource there. The model reproduced well the water and heat budgets after the construction of a reservoir in the middle reach of the river. It also correctly backcasted the degradation of water resources such as river discharge and groundwater after the completion of the reservoir. Calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite data clearly showed vegetation degradation downstream of the reservoir. Statistical analysis of a decoupling indicator based on the simulated water carrying capacity and on the satellite data of vegetation index indicated that water-related stress in Dalian city, where the economy has grown rapidly after the completement of the reservoir, has increased in accordance with the environmental degradation below the reservoir. The results indicate a close relationship between water resource and economic growth, which has greatly affected ecosystem degradation and its serious burden on the environment in the catchment.

It also distinguishes the different roles of developers, architects, interior designers, land owners (clients) and residents that can act as a barrier in achieving energy efficiency in residential buildings. The findings from this study indicate that doubling the thickness of external walls on east and west, use of hollow clay tiles instead of weathering course for roofs and use of appropriate horizontal overhang ratios for all four orientations can reduce the cooling load of the case study building by 64% and hence reduce the total energy use of the building by 26%. Finally it can be concluded that the process of designing energy efficient residential buildings is not a ‘one-man’s show’. Architects, developers, interior designers and clients are the other actors who can bring a change in the design practice.

AB  - For the usual case of receptors within a city, the area source component of urban air pollution is strongly dominated by the source strength pattern and by transport by the mean wind. Urban area source patterns tend to be fairly uniform and atmospheric diffusion conditions in cities tend to be of the near-neutral type, without the strong diurnal variations found elsewhere. For these reasons a simple area source formula X = c Q/u where X is air pollution concentration, Q is source strength per unit area, and u is average wind speed, is studied. The parameter c is, according to the authors' urban diffusion model, a weak function of city size and should be approximately constant. This formula is compared with means derived from a large quantity of air pollution data, average annual emissions and concentrations of particles for 44 U.S. Cities and SO2 data for 20 cities, in order to calibrate the constant, c. The constant c is found to equal about 225 for particles, and 50 for SO2. Standard deviations of c are roughly half their magnitude. The value c = 225 for particles is most representative of the purely meteorological processes governing urban diffusion, since c is low for SO2 because of the greater influence of strong elevated point sources and of SO2 decay. It is suggested that this simple formula has wide applicability in air pollution investigations.

AB  - Kusadasi is one of the prominent touristic and agricultural areas of Turkey. Kusadasi has grown exponentially for over 45 years due to domestic immigration and tourism. As a result urban sprawl occurred in the form of summer houses and touristic establishments. The development not only impinges on agricultural areas, but also it pressures the nearby national park system. Dilek Peninsula-Big Meander Delta National Park, in spite of its conservation status, faces significant challenges such as fire, water pollution, over grazing and hunting, exceeding visitor capacity during summer months, and thus the management actions focus on the interior dynamics. However, a greater threat is generated by the anthropogenic factors in the landscape context in which the parks are embedded. In a larger landscape scale, the interaction between the Kusadasi urban area and natural systems could be critical for the successful management of the resources. Thus, the purpose of this study is to detect the magnitude of urban growth in Kusadasi area by using remote sensing and GIS technology. The initial findings indicate the loss of olive plantations due to expansion of summer houses and touristic establishments. Most of the settlements take place on coastal areas and prime agricultural soils. Once small villages of Kusadasi expanded spatially and emerged with neighbor villages hence leaving scarce amount of large open spaces in the landscape matrix. The edge effect increases on the national park due to unsustainable urban development in its close vicinity.

AB  - We use applied microeconomics to examine several salient problems of urban transportation: traffic congestion, air pollution, the costs of motor vehicle accidents and the future of public transportation. Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.

AB  - This paper describes a model for assessing national urban transportation policy alternatives and its application in the 1974 National Transportation Study in the U.S. This multimodal version of the TRANS-Urban model system employs an aggregate modelling technique which treats each urban area as a single analysis unit. Given a level and mix of funds, the model calculates the amount of highway and transit facilities, travel demand by mode, system performance, and external impacts such as fatalities, land consumed, air pollution, dislocations and energy consumed. The model was applied to assess the effects of alternative funding and pricing policies for the 64 largest urbanized areas.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  - Dean’s Words Mohinder Singh Dean LTA Academy 2 012 has continued to see sustained effort in urban transport research, planning and development all over the world. We see evidence of this in the contributions to this issue of JOURNEYS, and even during some of the presentations made at the 3rd World Cities Summit held in Singapore in July this year. A highlight of the four day biennial event was the Flagship Urban Solutions Track (FUST) series of discussions which also explored the successes and challenges of various urban transport solutions. We are pleased to feature excerpts from one of those discussions, namely, Mobile Cities – In Search of New Urban Mobility Systems, here. Also, Dr Carlos Dora and Jamie Hosking, collaborating under the auspices of the World Health Organization, present an insightful review on the various ways urban transport directly and indirectly affects our overall health. Their findings are not confined to just physical health, but also examine other areas that have an impact on our well-being, including access to employment, education and recreation. From the portals of Demographia, a public policy firm in St Louis, USA, Wendell Cox questions the long-held and popular belief that lower density cities have longer average work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion compared to more compact cities. He puts forward several key evidence, arguments and analyses to show that the opposite is true – that higher urban densities are associated with longer work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion. London’s splendid showing during the 2012 Olympics is largely underscored by a well- planned public transportation strategy that ensured everyone arrived everywhere on time, with minimal disruption to the city’s daily business routine. The strategy leveraged on a Travel Demand Management programme christened Travel Advice for Business (TAB). Chris Hanley of Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was part of the team that delivered the TAB programme and shares exactly how it was done with a detailed account in this volume. Dr Wong Yiik Diew and Koh Puay Ping at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University provide a detailed examination of cycling mores in Singapore. They trace its evolution from an initially popular transport mode which was later relegated to being ‘the poor man’s transport’ and its current re-emergence as green transportation in an energy and environment conscious age. They also present the findings of a survey that revealed the preferences and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians affected by them. The survey findings could be useful in directing and determining the future of cycling culture in Singapore. The Land Transport Authority’s Mageret Ely and AECOM’s Elaine Brick continue the discussion on the topic of cycling in the final article, but from a more global perspective. Focusing on the growing popularity and success of bike-sharing schemes in three cities, namely, Paris, New York and Copenhagen, they outline how strategic policy, network planning, education and awareness contribute to the growth of such programmes. The various authors for this volume have generously given their time and talent to help improve our understanding of so many areas in urban transportation development and planning, and helped us to have a new outlook to old issues. They have provided invaluable insight and simultaneously demonstrated how we can never assume that convention cannot be challenged and ingenious solutions are inconceivable. For that, I most surely thank them and trust you will find this volume an enjoyable read. Before signing off, I would like to give you a sneak peek at what JOURNEYS 2013 will hold. We shall be producing one bumper volume in 2013, as a commemorative issue for the upcoming inaugural LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) 2013.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The nature of the urban built environment continues to be influenced by the conflicting interests and expectations of various entities involved in the process of development planning and implementation. The formulation and implementation of urban development plans in Turkey is guided by the statutory provisions of the country’s planning system. This process has led to piecemeal implementation through partial plans and plan amendments in metropolitan areas. This article attempts to determine how the private sector in metropoles in Turkey shaped the built environment in Turkey after 1980.

AB  - For the first time in human history, more than half the worlds population is urban. A fundamental aspect of this transformation has been the emergence of giant cities, or megacities, that present major new challenges. This book examines how issues of megacity development, urban form, sustainability, and unsustainability are conceived, how governance processes are influenced by these ideas, and how these processes have in turn influenced outcomes on the ground, in some cases in transformative ways. Through 15 in-depth case studies by prominent researchers from around the world, this book examines the major challenges facing megacities today. The studies are organized around a shared set of concerns and questions about issues of sustainability, land development, urban governance, and urban form. Some of the main questions addressed are: What are the most pressing issues of sustainability and urban form in each megacity? How are major issues of sustainability understood and framed by policymakers? Is urban form considered a significant component of sustainability issues in public debates and public policy? Who are the key actors framing urban sustainability challenges and shaping urban change? How is unsustainability, risk, or disaster imagined, and how are those concerns reflected in policy approaches? What has been achieved so far, and what challenges remain? The publication of this book is a step toward answering these and other crucial questions.

AB  - Travel demand management (TDM) has been included in many transportation plans over the past three decades to address key policy objectives, including energy conservation, environmental protection, and congestion reduction. Acknowledging that most of what planners do to operate the transportation system today is managing demand goes a long way toward understanding the need to better integrate TDM into the transportation planning process. Likewise, TDM is sometimes overlooked as a solution strategy because of skepticism over actual impacts, and difficulties with measuring results. To address this gap in current transportation planning practices and the growing role of demand management, FHWA has developed a desk reference titled Integrating Demand Management into the Transportation Planning Process. This article highlights the key content of that guidance and provides some insight into its use and utility. The desk reference will encourage transportation planners to take a more measured and thoughtful approach to integrating TDM into the planning process.

AB  - In the past decades, urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon in the city and its corresponding issues including the mitigation methods have become the main research topics in the area of urban climatology. Researchers have conducted various investigations and measurements in the urban environment. Prediction models such as impact mitigation strategies, urban air temperature predictions, improved weather forecasting and air quality forecasting have been developed as a result. With the current issue of sustainable urban development in the cities, urban planners are beginning to look into different aspects of urban climatic parameters and incorporate them as the design parameters. However, it is rather difficult for the planners to attempt to design without engaging the urban climate scientists. Presently, Geographical Information System (GIS) is a platform commonly used in various geographical related research and applications, including those relating to urban climate research, as it can be used to analyze different urban climatic parameters. Although it is, by all standards, an appropriate urban design tool, urban planners tend not to embrace this technology. This paper shall present an idea to overcome this challenge by means of developing a user friendly urban design platform that takes after GIS. This paper will also discuss the plan for advancement of the urban design tool from the current situation to the future. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is predictable that the situation in the neighbourhoods of Eastern Europe is different, especially in regard to those built during the Soviet era. Beginning with the assumption that the city planning ideas and ideals of the communist period are still present in urban space, the author explores daily activity spaces and attitudes of inhabitants towards them in the neighbourhood of Mezciems, which was planned and built during the Soviet era in the city of Riga, the capital of Latvia. In order to find out the ways the inhabitants perceive and use the space in a post-Soviet neighbourhood, as well as the ways in which they make the neighbourhood more liveable for themselves, the author uses semi-structured in-depth interviews with, and maps drawn by long-standing residents of the Mezciems neighbourhood. The results show that it is possible to mark out two lifestyles of long-standing residents during the Soviet era neighbourhood, characterized by different attitudes towards the functions available in the post-Soviet neighbourhood. At the same time, the spaces used, as well as the ideas about improvements that would make the post-Soviet neighbourhood space more enjoyable for them are quite similar within these two groups of people, characterized by different lifestyles.

The contributions of several disciplines - eco- nomics, operations research, management science, political science, public administra- tion, and others - are reviewed to assist in the development of a conceptual frame- work for a new community participation role, as a provider of key information to the planning process. An eclectic, experimental approach is recommended to explore the possibilities further.

AB  - The world has seen a significant rise in the number of conflicts and an intensification of their impacts, over the last few decades. UN-HABITAT has responded swiftly and effectively to these situations, whether in the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia or Sudan. One of the key areas of UN-HABITAT intervention and assistance has been institutional development and capac- ity-building in post-conflict situations, where conflict is often characterized by a breakdown of governance institutions and anarchy in human settlements reconstruction and redevelopment. UN-HABITAT has played a key role in the Balkans, especially in Kosovo, in restoring urban gov- ernance practices and introducing new local development planning process. UN-HABITAT has been engaged with the central and local governments in the Western Balkans through several interventions, most of them focusing on strengthening processes of participa- tory governance. The Urban Planning and Management Programme (UPMF) in Kosovo was a path-breaking intervention where UN-HABITAT worked closely with both central and local institutions to support the development of new policy and legislation relating to urban and spatial planning; to enhance local capacity for good governance and inclusive planning; and to strengthen local institutions with support from experts and professionals from across the world. UPMF is still being applied at the time of publication to train municipal and urban plan- ners in inclusive, strategic and action-oriented planning practices. Globally planning is in a state of flux and is reinventing itself to incorporate many of the charac- teristics mentioned above. Traditionally, urban planning has been seen as a means to control and regulate the development of towns and cities. In the cities of the developing world as well as in the post-conflict and post-disaster context, however, these traditional planning approach- es have failed to address the challenges of rapid urbanization and the poverty, exclusion, informality and vulnerability which it brings in its wake. At the third session of the World Urban Forum held in Vancouver 2006, discussions on a renewed role for planning in ensuring sus- tainable urbanization generated enormous interest. Several events brought to the fore several innovative cases and examples of how things are changing. UPMF is another example. It was also highlighted, however, that there is still a lot to be done, in order to change the practice of planning across the world, especially in post-disaster and post-conflict contexts.

AB  - Decision makers in freight transportation need to assess new distribution systems and the impacts of changes in the freight distribution environment on infrastructure needs and usage, logistical performance, emissions, and energy use. There is a need, therefore, for behavioral models that can predict goods flows and vehicle flows in both current and future situations. This research outlines a conceptual framework consisting of the markets, actors, and supply chain elements of freight movement. Supply chains are constructed by linking distribution channels (of different logistics characteristics) between different activity types, such as consumers, supermarkets, stores, offices, distribution centers, and factories. The framework outlined in this research was used to develop the GoodTrip model-a demand-driven, commodity-based freight movement model that incorporates supply chains. Starting with consumer demand, the model estimates goods flows and simulates vehicle tours. The open architecture of the model allows mixed use of empirical data, behavioral models, and scenario-type assumptions. The behavioral models will be developed in future research. In its first application, the GoodTrip model was used to compare the logistical performance and external impacts of three types of urban distribution systems: the traditional system and two concepts using urban distribution centers (one using vans, the other using automated underground vehicles). The results show considerable differences in the performance and effects of the alternatives, especially when they are applied to different types of distribution channels, such as food retail stores or bookstores.

The examination was performed through applying the three multicriteria evaluation methods--concordance analysis, the goals-achievement matrix and the compromise solution--to automobile restraint policies in the context of Seoul, Korea. The results of the research show that the methods employed have, despite certain drawbacks, considerable potential for assisting the decision-maker and others concerned with the transportation decision-making process. Their major advantage over traditional transportation evaluation methods is that they allow the consideration of a wider range of costs and benefits. The empirical analysis also illustrates the usefulness of including qualitative criteria into the evaluation framework without transforming them to a monetary dimension.

Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

Given a three-dimensional replacement of urban activity, greater concentration decreased surface air temperatures. Such concentration is apparently effective for modifying the thermal environment during the daytime, while the reduction of energy consumption is more effective during the night-time. Through sensitivity analysis, it is shown that building width and height variations with associated drag effects modify the environment near the ground.

Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

This concept has, if anything, been reinforced over the past 15 years. The institutional framework for decision making has repetedly been pointed to as one of the key characteristics influencing the effectiveness of planning. It has also been described as one of the important constraints limiting innovation and change. Given its central role in our descriptions of transportation planning, decision making and its linkage to planning remains as one of the most important sections (Chapter 2) in this edition. The material has been updated to include legeslation, regulations, and other contextual factors that influence the substabce and form of tranportational planning.

AB  - Acoustic noise and particle air pollution are among the most prominent environmental stressors in cities. They often result in cardiorespiratory diseases among urban dwellers and thus counteract important urban health targets. In cities, both stressors often occur simultaneously because their main source is urban traffic. Nevertheless, little is known about the combined exposure of acoustic noise and particle air pollution and their spatial distribution in urban residential areas. Filling this gap, landscape metrics were used to explain outdoor noise and PM10 patterns. Using Leipzig in central Germany as a case study, a highly statistical relationship exists between particle air pollution concentration and acoustic noise level that differs according to the urban structure type, as determined by landscape metrics. In conclusion, landscape metrics are very useful in predicting noise and PM10 exposure, together and in combination, for people in urban structures. Conversely, landscape metrics might serve as initial indicators of potential noise and air pollution in residential areas in cases in which no measured data are available, e.g., for planning purposes. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The vast amount of available spatio-temporal data of human activities and mobility has given raise to the rapidly emerging field of urban computing/informatics. Central to the latter is understanding the dynamics of the activities that take place in an urban area (e.g., a city). This can significantly enhance functionalities such as resource and service allocation within a city. Existing literature has paid a lot of attention on spatial dynamics, with the temporal ones often being neglected and left out. However, this can lead to non-negligible implications. For instance, while two areas can appear to exhibit similar activity when the latter is aggregated in time, they can be significantly different when introducing the temporal dimension. Furthermore, even when considering a specific area X alone, the transitions of the activity that takes place within X are important themselves. Using data from the most prevalent location-based social network (LBSN for short), Foursquare, we analyze the temporal dynamics of activities in New York City and San Francisco. Our results clearly show that considering the temporal dimension provides us with a different and more detailed description of urban dynamics. We envision this study to lead to more careful and detailed consideration of the temporal dynamics when analyzing urban activities. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - The euryhaline milkfish (Chanos chanos) is an excellent subject for studies of the physiological and behavioral processes involved in salinity adaptation. In this study, energy partitioning for metabolism, activity and growth, maximal activity performance and blood osmotic concentrations were assessed at two activity levels in juvenile milkfish fed equal rations and maintained at a relatively constant temperature (262 C) and at salinities (15, 35 and 55 ?) that represented a wide range of osmoregulatory challenges. Changes in the measured parameters were not consistently related to the magnitude of the trans-integumentary osmotic gradients. Routine oxygen consumption rates were high in 35 ? salinity (mean 1 s.e.m. 1678 mg O2 kg-1 h-1) and comparably low in 15 and 55 ? salinity (1336 and 1273 mg O2 kg-1 h-1, respectively). Routine activity levels (relative swimming velocity) were highest in 35 ? salinity (0. 960.04 L s-1), where L is standard length, intermediate in 15 ? salinity (0.770.03 L s-1) and lowest in 55 ? salinity (0.670.03 L s-1). Growth was significantly higher in 55 ? salinity (3.40.2 % increase in wet body mass per day) than in 35 ? salinity (2.40.2 % increase per day) and intermediate in 15 ? salinity (2.90.5 % increase per day). Maximum swimming velocities decreased with increases in salinity, from 9.90.7 L s-1 in 15 ? salinity to 6.60. 5 L s-1 in 55 ? salinity. Sustained swimming activity above routine levels for 2 h resulted in an increase in blood osmotic concentrations in milkfish in 55 ? salinity, but osmoregulation was re-established during the second 2 h of activity. Thus, patterns of variation in metabolic rate and growth were largely parallel to variations in routine activity although, comparing 15 and 55 ? salinity, elevated maintenance costs for osmoregulation at the high salinity were detectable. Reduced osmoregulatory abilities and reductions in maximal swimming performance suggest that high salinity may constrain activity. The results demonstrate that investigations of salinity adaptation in euryhaline fishes should take into account the interactive effects of salinity on physiology and behavior.

AB  - In Australia, over 50% of threatened species occur within the urban fringe and accelerating urbanization is now a key threat. Biodiversity near and within urban areas brings much social benefit but its maintenance involves complex trade-offs between competing land uses. Urban design typically views biodiversity as a development constraint, not a value to be enhanced into the future. We argue that decisions could be more transparent and systematic and we demonstrate that efficient development solutions can be found that avoid areas important for biodiversity. We present a case study in the context of land use change across the city of Wyndham, a local Government west of Melbourne, Australia. We use reserve design tools in a novel way to identify priority development sites, based on a synthesis of ecological, social and economic data. Trade-offs between biodiversity conservation and other key development objectives and constraints (transport planning, flood risk and food production) are quantified. The analysis can be conducted dynamically with visually compelling output, facilitating more transparent, efficient and democratically derived urban planning solutions. We suggest that government agencies could adopt similar approaches to identify efficient planning solutions for both biodiversity and development in urban environments. ©

A TOD planning model for the land use of urban rail station area was explored by means of a multiple objective mathematical programming model. Three objectives were considered: encouraging transit system volume, promoting livable communities, and balancing land use. The model can easily be solved by transforming it into a linear multi-programming problem. The Xujiahui rail rapid transit station area in Shanghai is chosen as case study to illustrate the model application and planning results. The result indicates that the model would be efficient in practice.

AB  - This paper asserts the continuing need for a long-range component to urban tran- sportation planning, citing particularly the relationships between short- and long-range planning and the dangers of a single-minded concentration on short-range planning. However, the nature of the long-range planning procedure that is required is substan- tively different from that of most extant approaches. Some of the specific requirements and capabilities of a new procedure are described, and existing procedures are compared against these. In the latter part of the paper, some of the elements of a new long-range planning procedure are characterized. It is suggested that the procedure be built around a scenario approach to confronting and bounding future uncertainty. Second, the need to incor- porate financial forecasting in the process is laid out and related to the scenario concept. Third, the need for travel- and impact-forecasting procedures is recognized and a set of input, output and operating requirements for such procedures are specified. It is sug- gested that improved sketch-planning tools may fit the requirements to a large extent. It is also suggested that some procedures or models in the process should be "synthetic" models, not needing calibration for each new application. Finally, a number of require- ments are specified for the display and evaluation of planning proposals from this pro- cedure. A major emphasis is placed here on transparency of the process and respon- siveness to direct intervention by the decision-maker.

AB  - In the development of methodology that can assist the decision-making process for reducing vehicle emissions in urban areas, the benefit of using geographic information systems (GIS) in enhancing the reliability of data is indeed significant. There are other positive features that could be used to enhance analyses and to prepare information in support of decision-making. These include: visualization of analysis results, improved communication with decision-makers, new analytical tools for testing transport technology innovations and investigating travel behaviour. This paper reports the methodological framework that is required for analysing the emission implications of measures that are intended to reduce vehicle emissions in urban transportation. A case study of the National Capital Region (NCR) Canada is used for illustration purposes. The overall framework for urban transportation planning, including emissions estimation, is introduced. The role of GIS is highlighted in terms of enhancing the reliability of data. Methodologies are noted that serve as an interface between travel analysis and emissions estimation. An emissions calculator is described that enables the estimation of air quality pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, results of selected scenarios are presented. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

While for economic efficiency and technological development purpose it may be important to have private providers of individual components, the efficient planning, co-ordination and method of recovery of common network costs for the entire system require public oversight. Furthermore, the transportation and telecommunications systems interact, sometimes as substitutes, sometimes as complements, having long-run ramifications for the spatial configuration of economic activity and the long-term use of this infrastructure.

There is a case for dedicated local bodies, with specialized expertise, which can act quickly and commercially, and which are not necessarily held back by entrenched local opinion. This raises the wider issue of the probable incompatibility between democracy and capitalism and/or free markets, a notion underpinning the UDCs.

The research from two studies is synthesized and, through development of travel demand forecasting model enhancements in the form of a subarea model and off-line estimation techniques, a link is sought between data analysis at the regional scale and urban design and land use strategies applied at the local and subregional scales. A methodology for aggregating individual transit-oriented development sites into a subregional growth scenario is described. Findings are reported from use of the subarea model to compare impacts of a transit-oriented growth scenario with a conventional growth scenario for a subregion of suburban communities.

AB  - 'Transforming Cities with Transit' explores the complex process of transit and land-use integration in rapidly growing cities in developing countries. As one of the most promising strategies for advancing environmental sustainability, economic competitiveness, and socially inclusive development in fast-growing cities, transit and land-use integration is increasingly being embraced by policy-makers at all levels of government. This book focuses on identifying barriers to and opportunities for effective coordination of transport infrastructure and urban development. Global best-case practices of transit-oriented metropolises that have direct relevance to cities in developing countries are first introduced. Key institutional, regulatory, and financial constraints that hamper integration and opportunities to utilize transit to guide sustainable urban development are examined in selected cities in developing countries. For this, the book analyzes their Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems and their impact on land development. The book formulates recommendations and implementation strategies to overcome barriers and take advantage of opportunities. It asserts that unprecedented opportunities have and will continue to arise for the successful integration of transit and land development in much of the developing world. Many cities in developing countries currently exhibit the pre-requisites - e.g., rapid growth, rising real incomes, and increased motorization and congestion levels - for BRT and railway investments to trigger meaningful land-use changes in economically and financially viable ways. Recommendations for creating more sustainable cities of the future range from macro-level strategies that influence land development and governance at the metropolitan scale to micro-level initiatives, like Transit Oriented Development (TOD), that can radically transform development patterns at the neighborhood level. The book will be of interest to a wide and diverse audience, including mayors, council members and other national and local policy makers, urban and transportation planners, transit-agency officials, and developers and staff of development financial institutions and others involved with TOD projects in rapidly growing and motorizing cities of the developing world.

Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - Many urban university campuses are considered major trip attractors. Considering the multimodal and complex nature of university campus transportation planning and operation, this paper proposes a dynamic traffic simulation and assignment analysis approach and demonstrates how such a methodology can be successfully applied. Central to the research is the estimation of trip origin-destinations and the calibration of a parking lot choice model. Dynamic simulation is utilized to simulate multiple modes of transportation within the transportation network while further assigning these modes with respect to various mode-specific roadway accessibilities. A multiple vehicle-class simulation analysis for planning purposes becomes a critical capability to predict how faculty and staff who once parked within the campus core choose other nearby alternate parking lots. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing integrated and reliable solutions for challenging questions that face urban university campus planners and local transportation jurisdictions. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Exposure to elevated levels of vehicular traffic has been associated with adverse cardiovascular and respiratory health effects in a range of populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing heart conditions, diabetes, obesity, and genetic susceptibilities. As these relationships become clearer, public health officials will need to have access to methods to identify areas of concern in terms of elevated traffic levels and susceptible populations. This paper briefly reviews current approaches for characterizing traffic exposure and then presents a detailed method that can be employed by public health officials and other researchers in performing screening assessments to define areas of potential concern within a particular locale and, with appropriate caveats, in epidemiologic studies examining traffic-related health impacts at the intra-urban scale. The method is based on two exposure parameters extensively used in numerous epidemiologic studies of traffic and health-proximity to high traffic roadways and overall traffic density. The method is demonstrated with publically available information on susceptible populations, traffic volumes, and Traffic Analysis Zones, a transportation planning tool long used by Metropolitan Planning Agencies and planners across the USA but presented here as a new application which can be used to spatially assess possible traffic-related impacts on susceptible populations. Recommendations are provided for the appropriate use of this methodology, along with its limitations.

One of Brøset’s goals is to create a housing environment that makes it easy for residents to choose forms of transportation other than the private car, thereby reducing transportation-related emissions. Previous research regarding the relevance of urban parameters on transport choice and on supporting non-vehicular transportation is reviewed. Aspects such as residential density, accessibility or distances are discussed as elements that influence travel behaviour.We will reflect on the implications given by previous studies in order to identify factors that are relevant to our case study. We also present an analysis of the current situation and discuss which measures may contribute to increasing the use of non-vehicular transportation at Brøset. In conclusion, the analysis shows that none of the urban elements that are usually associated with increasing non-vehicular transportation have been satisfactorily developed at Brøset at the moment. The analysis points out the challenges of creating a sustainable housing settlement in a suburban location. URBAN

This book examines how issues of megacity development, urban form, sustainability, and unsustainability are conceived, how governance processes are influenced by these ideas, and how these processes have in turn influenced outcomes on the ground, in some cases in transformative ways. Through 15 in-depth case studies by prominent researchers from around the world, this book examines the major challenges facing megacities today. The studies are organized around a shared set of concerns and questions about issues of sustainability, land development, urban governance, and urban form. Some of the main questions addressed are: What are the most pressing issues of sustainability and urban form in each megacity? How are major issues of sustainability understood and framed by policymakers? Is urban form considered a significant component of sustainability issues in public debates and public policy? Who are the key actors framing urban sustainability challenges and shaping urban change? How is unsustainability, risk, or disaster imagined, and how are those concerns reflected in policy approaches? What has been achieved so far, and what challenges remain? The publication of this book is a step toward answering these and other crucial questions.

AB  - Background: There is a body of evidence suggesting that the prevalence of respiratory allergic reactions induced by pollen in Europe is on the increase, a trend that is clearly evident in the Mediterranean area, and studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions and westernised lifestyle are correlated with the increasing frequency of pollen-induced respiratory allergy. Methods/Data Base: A review of the literature and own investigations. Results/Conclusion: There is a growing body of evidence that components of air pollution interact with inhalant allergens carried by pollen grains and may enhance the risk of both atopic sensitization and exacerbation of symptoms in sensitized subjects, since urban air pollution affects both airborne allergenic pollen and the airways of exposed subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urban sprawl is a potential environmental influence on youth overweight/obesity. However, little is known about the association between urban sprawl and behaviours that influence obesity such as active transportation and physical activity.\n\nMETHODS: The study population consisted of 7,017 respondents aged 12 to 19 to the 2007/2008 Canadian Community Health Survey, living in Canada's 33 census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Factor analysis was used to obtain an urban sprawl score for each CMA, incorporating dwelling density, percentage of single or detached dwelling units, and percentage of the population living in the urban core. Multi-level logistic regression examined whether urban sprawl was associated with frequent active transportation (30 or more minutes a day), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (60 or more minutes a day), and overweight/obesity.\n\nRESULTS: Urban sprawl was associated with active transportation among 12- to 15-year-olds, with the relative odds of engaging in at least 30 minutes of active transportation per day increasing by 24% (95% CI: 10-39%) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in the urban sprawl score. For the entire sample aged 12 to 19, higher urban sprawl was associated with MVPA (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), but not with overweight/obesity (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.94-1.18).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Urban sprawl was associated with active transportation and MVPA in Canadian youth, although in the opposite direction to what has been reported in the literature for adults.

AB  - Gametogenic activity, growth, mortality and somatic production of an unexploited population of Pinctada imbricata from the Cabo de la Vela (Guajira, Colombian Caribbean, 12??10'N, 72??20'W) was studied. P. imbricata exhibits a continuous gametogenic cycle with a 5-month period (January to June) of high gametogenic activity. Gametogenesis is inversely correlated to temperature, suggesting a relation between spawning and upwelling-induced food availability. Final growth parameters according to the von Bertalanffy-growth equation, estimated from tagging-recapture data, were L(??) = 84.0 mm and K = 0.939 year-1; total mortality, corresponding to natural mortality M, was calculated as Z = 2.687 year-1. The P/B-ratio for this population estimated with the weight specific growth rate method was 1.515. From the results, it was generally concluded that P. imbricata has a large aquaculture potential in this region owing to its continuous gametogenic cycle, and a high growth and production rate.

AB  - With more than half of the world’s population living in urban areas and climate change, one of the biggest challenges of our times, it is time to turn our attention to cities in order to tackle this challenge. The layout or urban form of a city can influence the environmental impact of the urban settlement to a considerable extent. There are great differences between cities in terms of their urban form and their environmental footprints. Five key elements of urban form can be distin- guished: density, surface, land use, road/public transport infrastructure and the eco- nomic relationship with the surrounding environment. The compact city is often advocated as a more sustainable urban form but this is not undisputed. Urban form can influence the environmental impact, but it can only facilitate; it is people and their behaviour that ultimately determine the negative or positive environmental impact of urban areas.

AB  - The Institute of Transport Studies has developed a Transportation and Environment Strategy Impact Simulator (TRESIS) as a decision support system to assist planners to predict the impact of transport strategies and to make recommendations based on those predictions. A key focus of the simulator is the richness of policy instruments such as new public transport, new toll roads, congestion pricing, gas guzzler taxes, changing residential densities, introducing designated bus lanes, implementing fare changes, altering parking policy, introducing more flexible work practices, and the introduction of more fuel efficient vehicles. The appropriate- ness of mixtures of policy instruments is gauged in terms of a series of performance indicators such as impacts on greenhouse gas emissions, accessibility, equity, air quality and household consumer surplus. In this paper we introduce TRESIS to the research community, focussing on the structure of the system and the diversity of applications. Applications are presented to illus- trate the diversity and richness of TRESIS as a policy advisory tool.

AB  - In most metropolitan regions throughout the globe, urbanised land area is increasing to accommodate increasing population size. This article provides a simple yet powerful mathematical description of this urban expansion. Specifically, the following scaling relationship is proposed: land area (A) increases proportionally to population size (P) raised to a power (n)-- i.e. A {propto} P n. During 1950--2000, this relationship is found to hold well for US Census urban areas (UAs) with a greater than 10 per cent increase in population. Values for the parameter n vary among UAs, with a central tendency value of [~] 2, suggesting that, on average, newcomers to urban areas occupy about twice the land area per capita of existing residents. If n were exactly equal to 2, then the parameter group P/{surd}A (called `linear population density', or LPD) would be constant over time. LPD (units: people per metre) is the number of people in a metre-wide strip across an urban area. LPD is distinct from, and behaves somewhat differently than, population density. Distributions of LPD values among US UAs during 1950--2000 show surprisingly little variability over multidecade time-scales. For example, from 1950 to 2000, average population, land area and population density changed by more than a factor of 2, but average LPD changed less than 10 per cent. Few, if any, other attributes of urban form have remained so constant during this half-century time-period. International data corroborate the finding that LPD distributions are roughly constant over multidecadal time-scales. These results suggest an underlying pattern to how people arrange themselves within and among urban areas. For US UAs, rank--size rules similar to the generalised version of Zipf's rule hold for population, land area, LPD and population density. LPD is an important predictor of the emissions-to-inhalation relationship for motor vehicle emissions. Results presented here are important for theoretical, practical and empirical investigations of urban form and of how urban areas expand over time.

AB  - Recent developments in intelligent transportation systems pose new challenges and opportunities for urban transportation planning. To meet these challenges and to exploit these opportunities, a framework for a new transportation planning methodology has been developed. The methodology operates in a computer environment, called PLANiTS (Planning and Analysis Integration for Intelligent Transportation Systems), designed to facilitate the entire planning process form problem identification, through idea generation and analysis, on to prioritization and programming. To assist in problem identification, PLANiTS provides graphic representation of current conditions, including traffic, air pollution, accidents, and projections of future conditions. A computerized knowledge base, containing information about possible strategies and their effects, and a model base, containing transportation and other analysis models, are used to guide the user in identifying potentially effective strategies and performing the appropriate analysis. To facilitate the use of these tools, PLANiTS provides computer support of group processes such as brainstorming, deliberation, and consensus seeking. PLANiTS is designed for use in urban transportation planning at the local, regional, and state levels; it is intended to support a variety of participants in the planning process including transportation professionals, decision makers in transportation agencies (often local elected officials), citizens, and interest groups. Recognizing that transportation planning is essentially a deliberative, political process, PLANiTS is designed to inform and facilitate, but not replace, the political decision-making process.

AB  - Estimates of air pollution removal by the urban forest have mostly been based on mean values of forest structure variables for an entire city. However, the urban forest is not uniformly distributed across a city because of biophysical and social factors. Consequently, air pollution removal function by urban vegetation should vary because of this spatial heterogeneity. This paper presents a different approach to evaluate how the spatial heterogeneity of the urban forest influences air pollution removal at the socioeconomic subregion scale. Air pollution removal for July 1997 to June 1998 and July 2000 to June 2001 were estimated using measured urban forest structure data from three socioeconomic subregions in Santiago, Chile. Dry deposition was estimated using hourly climate, mixing height, and pollutant concentration data. Pollution removal rates among the three socioeconomic subregions were different because of heterogeneous urban forest structure and pollution concentrations. Air pollution removal per square meter of tree cover was greatest in the low socioeconomic subregion. Pollution removal during 1997-1998 was different from 2000 to 2001 due to pollution concentration differences. Seasonal air quality improvement also differed among the subregions. Results can be used to design management alternatives at finer administrative scales such as districts and neighborhoods that maximize the pollution removal rates by the urban forest in a subregion. Policies that affect the functionality of urban forest structure must consider spatial heterogeneity and scale when making region-wide recommendations. Similarly, when modeling the functionality of the urban forest, models must capture this spatial heterogeneity for inter-city comparisons. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The movement of people, goods, and information within the local metropolitan area is critically important to the functioning of cities. This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

AB  - In the review of the scale of urban air pollution is assessed and the sources and health effects of the main urban pollutants are identified.  Methods of monitoring, used to determine compliance with UK air quality standards, are reviewd, and important sampling criteria are determined.  Measurements of spatial and temporal variations in pollutant concentrations are described  using both single-site samplers.  The declines in concentration of the "'traditional' pollutants, supher dioxide (SO2) and smoke, as well as in airborne lead, are compared to the increasing emissions of traffic-related pollutants, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and fine particulates.  For each of these pollutants appropriate monitoring methods are described.  A case study of Cambridge air quality data illustrates the changing nature of urban air pollution.  Finally, long-term air quality monitoring programmes are seen to have an important role in determining the effectiveness of future vehicle emission and traffic managment schemes for urban centres.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

AB  - Sporisorium reilianum, the fungus that causes sorghum head smut, was grown with sucrose, lactose, trehalose or raffinose in liquid suspension or on a solid medium. Liquid culture media were analyzed for hydrolysis products of these carbohydrates to determine extracellular enzyme activity of the fungus. Increased amounts of glucose and fructose in the culture medium of S. reilianum grown with sucrose or raffinose indicated that invertase (beta-fructofuranosidase, 3.2.1.26) activity was present. No evidence of extracellular galactosidase or trehalase activity was found. Enhanced sporidial colony formation on carbohydrates that can be hydrolyzed to hexoses, and specific forms of mycelial growth on lactose, trehalose or on a carbohydrate-deficient medium might suggest that mycelial growth is a way to foraging for food sources. However, the rapid and profuse mycelial growth on the host cell wall glycoprotein appears to be in response to abundant food supply (probably of a different type). Therefore availability of different kinds of carbon sources in the environment of the growing fungus might determine dimorphism and associated pathogenesis by S. reilianum.

This paper introduces the Sequenced Activity-Mobility Simulator (SAMS), a dynamic and integrated microsimulation forecasting system for transportation, land use and air quality, designed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional four-step travel demand forecasting systems. The proposed SAMS framework represents a departure from many of the conventional paradigms in travel demand forecasting. In particular, it aims at replicating the adaptative dynamics underlying transportation phenomena; explicitly incorporates the time-of-day dimension; represents human behavior based on the satisficing, as opposed to optimizing, principle; and endogenously forecasts socio-demographic, land use, vehicle fleet mix, and other variables that have traditionally been projected exter- nally to be input into the forecasting process.

A survey of all urban transportation-related editorials appearing in a sample of 155 U.S. newspapers during a period of 19 months in 1973-74 revealed that a number of issues related to transit financing, transit and highway investment, bicycles, and the transportation planning process were currently under debate in the urban press. This paper presents the survey's findings regarding the incidence and viewpoint of articles on these and other issues. Transit financing concerns clearly emerged as the most frequently discussed, and some agreement in editorial viewpoint was also found.

The goal of the study was to understand the perceived visual aesthetic quality of the PRT within diverse architectural and natural elements composing the town's main spatial and visual structure and to separate the various components that determine a cumulative visual experience. We utilized human perceptual judgments as indicators of visual aesthetic quality, and referred to a psychophysical method to assess the perceived visual aesthetic quality of the scenes. Perceptions were captured using a rank ordering process of most and least preferred scenes on presented panels and responses were analyzed using correlation and regression statistical techniques. Results indicate that specific design attributes such as pillar shape or size, and type of fascia, did not emerge as significantly influencing public perception, while the relationship between automated structure and vehicular infrastructure, and the position of the observer are particularly important. Overall findings indicate that studies conducted on automated transportation should consider the effect of context on the perception of the system. The findings improve our understanding of visual strengths and weaknesses of automated transportation structures within the urban environment and can be useful in the planning for similar transportation systems. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Over the past three decades, an array of legislation with attendant regulations has been implemented to enhance the quality of the environment and thereby improve the public's health. Despite the many beneficial changes that have followed, there remains a disproportionately higher prevalence of harmful environmental exposures, particularly air pollution, for certain populations. These populations most often reside in urban settings, have low socioeconomic status, and include a large proportion of ethnic minorities. The disparities between racial/ethnic minority and/or low-income populations in cities and the general population in terms of environmental exposures and related health risks have prompted the "environmental justice" or "environmental equity" movement, which strives to create cleaner environments for the most polluted communities. Achieving cleaner environments will require interventions based on scientific data specific to the populations at risk; however, research in this area has been relatively limited. To assess the current scientific information on urban air pollution and its health impacts and to help set the agenda for immediate intervention and future research, the American Lung Association organized an invited workshop on Urban Air Pollution and Health Inequities held 22-24 October 1999 in Washington, DC. This report builds on literature reviews and summarizes the discussions of working groups charged with addressing key areas relevant to air pollution and health effects in urban environments. An overview was provided of the state of the science for health impacts of air pollution and technologies available for air quality monitoring and exposure assessment. The working groups then prioritized research needs to address the knowledge gaps and developed recommendations for community interventions and public policy to begin to remedy the exposure and health inequities.

This paper presents an integrative approach to the problem of sustainable land-use planning. Specifically, an urban growth simulation tool, a cellular automata model, was used to determine the extent of the urban area, and a neural network approach was used to quantitatively predict the land-use structure in the projected year. A multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm was then developed to search for Pareto-optimal urban land-use plans within the urban extent determined by the urban growth model. To search for a sustainable urban land-use plan, social, economic, and environmental objectives were defined that reflect the multiple objectives of the urban system.

AB  - When aligned with other services and facilities, transportation helps generate powerful forces for influencing the long-run real-estate market. Working to improve the productivity and livability of urban areas, officials are increasingly looking to metropolitan policy studies for effective action and regulation programs. Thus, beyond immediate considerations of access and congestion, transportation decisions are now expected to reflect the impacts of governmental programs on general urban development. The processes through which transportation decisions are made are themselves being modified in recognition of the broad reverberations of transport policy. With a wider array of persons and governmental units concerned with these decisions, the criteria applied to the alternative possibilities are becoming more comprehensive. Criteria applied depend not merely on personal outlook but also on the scope of responsibilities of the person weighing the alternatives. Two opposite tendencies are at work: a search for a reduction of criteria toward a single optimizing index accounting for all significant costs and benefits implicit in a proposed line of policy and program; conversely, a search better to identify and describe all the significant manifold repercussions of alternative proposals as these are viewed by different people.

AB  - We have developed a modelling system for evaluating the traffic volumes, emissions from stationary and vehicular sources, and atmospheric dispersion of pollution in an urban area. The dispersion modelling is based on combined application of the urban dispersion modelling system (UDM-FMI) and the road network dispersion model (CAR-FMI). The system includes also a meteorological pre-processing model and a statistical and graphical analysis of the computed time series of concentrations. The modelling system contains a method, which allows for the chemical interaction of pollutants, originating from a large number of urban sources. This paper presents an overview of the modelling system and its application for estimating the NOx and NO2 concentrations in the Helsinki metropolitan area in 1993. A companion paper addresses comparison of model predictions with the results of an urban measurement network. This modelling system is an important regulatory assessment tool for the national environmental authorities.

This paper examines this strategy by exploring the interface between urban structure, transportation energy consumption, and transportation policy. The interrelationships between travel demand and urban form are first examined, and research attempts to clarify and model these relationships are reviewed. The role of transportation as a land use development control is discussed, and the use of “transportation performance standards” is proposed as a method for integrating transportation energy considerations into land development controls and decisions.

AB  - Research in transportation, urban design, and planning has examined associations between physical environment variables and individuals' walking and cycling for transport. Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.

AB  - Urban transportation planning and land-use policies play a pivotal role in every society and are the subjects of interest in many academic fields. Creating a tool that measures the benefits and costs associated with the built environment, which includes the surrounding land-use and transportation system, would allow decision makers to choose the best option available to them when deciding on those important issues. In addition to travel time, congestion, safety, energy, and environment, public health is an important subject that can be affected by a transportation system. The primary objective of this study is to develop models for different health-related variables including general health, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, asthma, and heart attack. This is to investigate the role of transportation, land-use, and the built environment variables along with demographic and socioeconomic factors on people?셲 health. The results of the analysis showed that increasing the transit use and decreasing the autouse have a significant positive impact on all the health variables except for asthma. It was found that every percent decrease in autouse would reduce the chance of obesity by 0.4%, high blood pressure by 0.3%, high blood cholesterol by 1.3%, and heart attack by 1%. In addition to the transit-oriented development, making the environment more pedestrian friendly could motivate people to be more physically active in their daily routines and have a healthier lifestyle.

AB  - Recent economic expansion and population growth in developing countries have had a big impact on the development of large cities like Delhi, India. Accompanied by Delhi's rapid spatial growth over the last 25 years, urban sprawl has contributed to increased travel. The vehicle fleet projected at current growth rates will result in more than 13 million vehicles in Delhi in 2020. Planning and managing such a rapidly growing transport sector will be a challenge. Choices made now will have effects lasting well into the middle of the century. With such rapid transport growth rates, automobile emissions have become the fastest increasing source of urban air pollution. In India, most urban areas, including Delhi, already have major air pollution problems that could be greatly exacerbated if growth of the transport sector is managed unwisely. The transport plans designed to meet such large increases in travel demand will have to emphasize the movement of people, not vehicles, for a sustainable transportation system. Therefore, a mathematical model was developed to estimate the optimal transportation mix to meet this projected passenger-km demand while satisfying environmental goals, reducing congestion levels, and improving system and fuel efficiencies by exploiting a variety of policy options at the minimum overall cost or maximum welfare from transport. The results suggest that buses will continue to satisfy most passenger transport in the coming decades, so planning done in accordance with improving bus operations is crucial.

AB  - Purpose: Findings from prospective studies on associations between physical activity and adiposity among youth are inconsistent. Our aim was to describe physical activity trajectories during secondary school and examine the association with change in adiposity in youth. Methods: Physical activity was measured in 20 survey cycles from 1999 to 2005; anthropometrics were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. Individual growth curves modeling moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) were estimated. Estimates of initial level and rate of decline in MVPA and VPA bouts per week were included as potential predictors of body fat% and body mass index using age- and sex-specific linear regression. Results: Complete data were available for 840 and 760 adolescents aged 12-13 years at baseline, followed from survey cycles 1-12 and 12-19, respectively. Among girls, yearly declines of one MVPA and one VPAbout per week during earlier adolescence were associated with increases of 0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.36) and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.015-0.92) units of body fat%, respectively. In boys, a yearly decline ofone MVPA bout per week was associated with an increase of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.05-0.70) units of body fat%during later adolescence. Conclusions: Obesity prevention programs should include strategies to prevent declines in physical activity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Transportation, as a facility, has made movements easier for humans. Over time, developments have contributed to better transportation. With increasing demand for better transportation systems, which is capital intensive, research and study have to be conducted to minimize costs and maximize benefits. In the development of urban network, one of the most important and critical problems encountered is locating land uses and existing route network. In other words, the layout of urban transportation network plays a significant role in urban landuse development. Some land uses are more sensitive to transportation environmental impacts. Therefore, there is a complex and dynamic relationship between landuse and transportation. Many researches were carried out in the past to visualize the desirable and undesirable situations of transportation in the field of urban landuse locations. Some researches had focused on individual fields, such as transportation, urban planning, accessibility and air pollution; while others were carried out involving more than one field. This research focuses on the issue of developing a spatial and mathematical model in optimizing distance of residential area from road (urban network). It requires understanding the main effective factors to develop this model. Different models of urban landuse and transportation contribute to this study. Urban models give expressions separately about urban landuse structure on which there is a significant influence by transportation planning. Useful models can be classified into several groups based on different criteria such as context, time, methods and tools. In this research, the relevant models on transportation and landuse were classified into: accessibility models (maximum distance) and air pollution models (minimum distance). In this study, air quality is chosen as a key element with respect to its critical roles in the quality of life and urban health. The overall objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model to plan appropriate locations for residential land uses and urban transportation network development to address one issue-air quality. Arak, a developing city in Iran has been chosen as a case study. The methodology of this study helps to select suitable sites for the development of urban transportation network and residential zones. It covers reducing air quality by the definition of optimum distance between residential zones and roads based on mathematical model and good establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. GIS as a powerful tool is applied for overlaying layers and interpretation of several scenarios. The results show the mathematical model, with acceptable accuracy, can be applied for the establishment of urban transportation network in proportion to residential zones. Based on the suitability maps, approximately around all main roads, there are non-suitable residential zones located in potential polluted areas. It will be dangerous for human health of residents. This research has successfully managed development of a scientific approach for current and future model development that can be employed in transportation planning and residential landuse suitability assessment at both local and national structure plan levels. Methodology: The main component of this study is a mathematical model to incorporate air quality and quantitative interpretation of accessibility associated with the residential zone development. This mathematical model was adopted to incorporate accessibility and air quality associated with residential zone development. It included the spatial and quantitative parameters relevant for the emissions and effects of pollutants in relation to urban transportation. Arc GIS 9.1 and Arc View GIS version 3.1 were used to provide the framework for the operation of the model for mapping air pollution. The availability of spatial data types and functionalities of the software influenced the model design and plan. Designing the decision model and plan was the major task of this research. The basic conditions in finding a good location were expressed under two questions: ii) What are the positive and negative effects (i.e. benefits and costs) of urban transportation network on its surrounding environment? ii) How are the good and bad locations (i.e. benefits and costs) of the residential zone related to the above-mentioned effects and surrounding affected environment? The basic idea behind these two questions is to examine the interactions of landuse and urban transportation network. Urban transportation network is defined as a mathematical representation of the physical transportation infrastructure in the city. This mathematical process is shown in Fig. 1. (Figure presented) Location of urban transportation network, largely determines how much area of urban land use can be accessed easily from origin to destination. It is considered a high-activity land use, as it attracts people and activities, resulting in higher environmental pollution around it, such as noise and air pollution. With the consideration of these characteristics, the urban transportation network should not be located close to residential land use, which requires a safe environment around it. So, residential land uses and transportation parameters should be considered in a balanced way, to get a suitable location for an urban transportation network which meets the transportation requirements of residents optimally. This decision making process has both spatial and non-spatial dimensions. In this study, a plan were developed, by mathematical and spatial approaches, which incorporated spatial and non-spatial criteria arranged to answer the two basic questions on the influence of transportation on the environment of surrounding land uses. With arranging these criteria to search for suitable locations of residential land use and urban transportation network, objectives and sub-objectives of the study could be obtained. It was also necessary to evaluate the plan and model through fieldwork, statistical tools and interview. Result and Discussion: The research outputs include mathematical model and its accuracy, potential locations for residential land use development, and existing suitable developed locations for residential land use. It shows how the developed mathematical model is utilized to achieve the objectives and sub-objectives of the research to finally identify the suitable locations for the residential land use. The mathematical model developed in this study comprised most of the criteria. Individual formulas and models of each criterion may not meet the objectives of the research individually. However, their preferences were incorporated in the final model. The structure of the developed model enables interactive modification by changing the weights and properties of the parameters. With respect to the scenarios analysis, economical and technical limitations, future development of residential land use and urban transportation networks in the study area will be possible based on the following priorities: a. Re-designation of transportation networks (with more replacing local road types by arterial roads) in existing non-suitable locations of residential land use, b. Development of residential land use and urban transportation networks in suggested locations for the future development of residential land use, c. Removing some unnecessary roads in existing non-suitable locations of residential land use, and d. Changing some of the residential land uses in existing non-suitable locations of residential areas. The research strategy is able to support urban planners with a range of options. However, for selecting the best or most suitable sites, more comprehensive model and plan can be deve loped, from which choosing the sites from the alternatives will be the main purpose. Several urban land uses and environmental impacts of transportation are not placed in the model and plan, because they are exclusive for the choice phase of the study. Implementation of method and scenarios analysis suggests that some areas can be more suitable for residential land use and urban transportation network development than others, if performances and criteria are considered carefully. This suitability largely d epends on the goals of the transportation projects; however, the importance of the main elements (air quality) cannot be ignored in all transportation projects. The method developed in this study is not suitable for exact site selection purpose. It may be used as a generalized spatial decision support tool to support decision-making for locating residential land use and urban transportation network. Development and implementation of methods in the study area have materialized the following results: a. Illustration of a new implementation using spatial method in urban transportation planning. Innovative GIS utilization in urban transportation can explain air quality. b. Development of a complex mathematical spatial decision support model for determining the location of residential land uses, in proportion to urban transportation network. c. Exploration and arrangement of a number of criteria or factors which could be interpreted to predict suitable land uses and urban networks location in quantitative framework. d. Illumination of the parallel important role of environmental and economical sectors and users impacted by urban travel and land use activity in spatial framework.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - Abstract&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper studies the use of ecological research information in urban planning focusing on Finland. Research questions addressed the importance and challenges of incorporating ecological information into the planning process, and ways to promote the use of ecological information. Fifteen key professionals from three representative development approval processes in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area were interviewed. The interviewed planners and ecologists considered ecological information important for identifying and preserving valuable urban nature and biodiversity, diminishing negative environmental impacts of construction and for enabling nature-related experiences and services for urban residents. The identified challenges for the use of the information included insufficiency, fragmented nature and lack of adequacy of information, as well as problems with the interpretation and presentation of information. In order to provide more comprehensive ecological information from urbanizing areas in Finland; there should be more coordinated efforts to produce research information that planners really need, ecologists should be more active in the process in providing ecological insights for plans, a proper and simple biodiversity valuation method should be developed, more research on the function on ecological corridors should be conducted, and biodiversity monitoring of implemented planning projects should be developed

AB  - Traffic noise in cities has serious effects on the inhabitants. Well-known effects are annoyance and sleep disturbance, but long-term health effects such as cardiovascular disease have also been related to traffic noise. The spatial distribution of traffic noise in a city is related to the distributions of traffic volume and urban density, and also to urban form. This relation is investigated by means of numerical calculations for two cities, Amsterdam and Rotterdam, and for various idealized urban fabrics. The concept of urban traffic elasticity is introduced to relate local population density to local vehicle kilometers driven on the urban road network. The concept of Spacematrix is used to represent urban density and urban form. For the two cities it is found that the average sound level in an urban area decreases with increasing population and building density. The results for idealized urban fabrics show that the shape of buildings blocks has a large effect on the sound level at the least-exposed fa??ade (quiet fa??ade) of a building, and a smaller effect on the sound level at the most-exposed fa??ade. Sound levels at quiet facades are in general lower for closed building blocks than for open blocks such as strips. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the &quot;smart growth&quot; movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of &quot;smart growth&quot;, discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the &quot;smart growth&quot; label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan &quot;smart growth&quot;) is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of &quot;smart growth&quot;.

AB  - It is a well established fact that the urban landscape creates a climate which influences, for example, human comfort, air quality and energy consumption. However, in spite of this knowledge, it has been recognised that climate issues often have low impact on the urban planning process in practice. The reason for this lack of influence is an important question for which answers must be sought among climatologists, planners and the planning process. The main objective with the present study was to investigate if, how and when knowledge about the climate is used in the urban planning process. The research strategy was developed in an interdisciplinary research group involving climatologists and planners. Case studies involving different interview techniques and historical data were carried out by different actors involved in urban planning at the municipality level in three cities in Sweden. The study showed that urban planners were interested in climatic aspects but the use of climatic information was unsystematic and the results confirmed that climatology has a low impact on the planning process. The low impact is a result of several constraints which could be related to five explanatory variables i.e. conceptual and knowledge based, technical, policy, organisational and the market. The discussion part of the paper presents some key conclusions which address these constraints. It is important that urban climatologists meet the planners demand-driven needs by providing them with good arguments, suitable methods and tools. Urban climatologists are also encouraged to improve the awareness of the importance of urban climate not only among planners but also among decision-makers and the public. However, as planning is a political activity which not always is based on or even related to scientific knowledge, some of the identified constraints could only be counteracted through improved institutional capacity in the social context of planning.

AB  - Location-based check-in services in various social media applications have enabled individuals to share their activity-related choices providing a new source of human activity data. Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users' weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Debates on the urban form have become strongly polarized between the advocates and opponents of the compact and of the dispersed or “sprawled” city. In this paper we argue that this may be the result of an excessive concentration on the study of the American experience and the neglect of other urban contexts, and examine the recent process of urban growth against the background of urban compactness and extreme densification represented by the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). The comparison of two detailed land-cover maps of 1993 and 2000 shows a progressive transformation in the traditional urban character of the region. Lower urban densities, high losses of non-urban land covers, depopulation of the metropolitan inner core, an increasing importance of single housing or the expansion of transportation infrastructures confirm the generalization of the dispersed urban model. However, the presence of numerous medium sized towns has also proved to be a deterrent of excessive dispersion. In conclusion, polycentric metropolitan areas such as the BMR may be more adjusted to absorb the negative effects of dispersion than monocentric areas.

AB  - `Urban activity patterns' are spatial and temporal patterns of human activities in urban areas. As people pursue activities at multiple locations, trips are produced between successive activity locations. Patterns formed by trips over a period, such as a day, are called `travel patterns.' Characteristics of activity and travel patterns and analytical approaches taken in previous studies that examined them are summarized in this article. Discussions are organized into the following subject areas: time allocation, activity duration, time of day characteristics of activity engagement, activity sequencing, activity and travel, typologies of activity-travel patterns, urban travel pattern characteristics, trip chaining, interpersonal linkages, day-to-day variability, and behavioral dynamics.

AB  - The "political economy of place" has emerged as an important theme in urban research in recent years. Within this theme, scholars have highlighted the role of so-called urban growth coalitions in the creation of conditions favorable for urban economic development. Among their activities, growth coalitions may be interested in jurisdictional organization and, in particular, municipal annexation. This paper examines the conditions that have facilitated annexation as a postwar growth policy in metropolitan Columbus, Ohio, and the role of urban growth coalitions in shaping the policy. The policy has been effective to the extent that annexation to Columbus for municipal purposes has not included decisions on the transfer of school district territory.

AB  - The transportation - urban form nexus lies at the heart of urban sustainability. Transportation provides the physical connectivity between people, firms and activities that permits economic and social interactions to occur. It also provides physical definition to urban areas in terms of the street system and our perceptions of how locations "connect" in space and time. And the accessibility to opportunities that it provides influences land development decisions and location choices of households and businesses. In particular, as urban areas continue to expand, automobile-dominated transportation systems both facilitate and promote inefficient "sprawl" that has ramifications for all elements of urban physical and social infrastructure (water, handling of wastes, schools, heath care, etc.) in addition to the transportation system per se. Urban form (i.e., the spatial distribution of people, businesses and other activities), in turn, fundamentally determines both travel demand and the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of transportation. Most notably, public transit systems (as well as non-motorised modes of travel such as walking and bicycles) can only provide effective alternatives to the automobile if transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban forms are built. Transportation systems are major generators of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise. They are also almost totally dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels as their source of energy. This paper sketches the broad dimensions of the modern urban transportation design problem, with emphasis on its connections with other elements of urban design, particularly the question of urban form. These dimensions include both physical infrastructure and services (roads, transit services, etc.) and the intelligent operational control of these facilities and services. Elements of a coordinated research program to address pressing short- and long-run urban transportation planning problems are then outlined.

AB  - China's population was 1.1 billion in 1990; it is expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2000. Its urban population was 33% in 1990 and is expected to grow to 47% by 2000. This enormous urban growth poses tremendous challenges to urban transportation planners. The five magacities-Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Wuhan-are planning for light rail transit/subway (LRT/MRT) systems that will cost $10 billion to $15 billion (U.S. dollars). However, China does not have the money and will depend on foreign aid and borrowing. Concurrently planners disagree about the appropriate role of motorized and nonmotorized transportation, especially the bicycle: some wish to abolish, restrict, or redirect it, and others wish to expand its systems role. The global LRT/MRT experience suggests that such systems are expensive and take a long time to build. Forecasting systems for cost and ridership are unreliable; actual costs are more than two or three times the forecast. The urban transportation trends and issues in China are discussed on the basis of a very diverse array of data research sources. The analysis includes mode splits, costs, and reliability functions, and their applicability to Chinese cities. It proposes a strategic planning framework for Chinese urban areas, focusing on optimum modal mixes, investment and regulatory policies, and transportation system management. Although the framework has been developed particularly for China, it is generally applicable to other low-income countries in Asia.

AB  - Travel can affect land use just as land use affects travel behaviour of people. Low-cost travel, especially resulting from transportation improvements since the nineteenth century, has resulted in long-distance travel and urban sprawl, bringing along negative aspects such as traffic congestion and air pollution, but also reductions in biodiversity and public health. In order to try to partly reverse this process, the supply of infrastructure and public transportation can no longer follow the demand of transportation; the supply has to steer the demand. Infrastructure and high-quality public transportation should be clustered in and between large and regional cities. Increasing travel costs for car use (e.g., road pricing) can positively affect travel distances and travel mode choice, but also long-term decisions such as the residential location choice, stimulating compact, mixed-use developments. In this paper, we focus on Flanders, Belgium, a region where mobility policies stimulated long-distance travel and limited land use regulations did not hinder urban sprawl. Increasing travel costs combined with a more active spatial planning policy and a stronger cooperation between mobility policy and spatial planning can help to decrease car use and urban sprawl, but also change the way in which people perceive travel. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The energy crisis and various urban problems stemming from auto congestion, pollution, and the cost of providing public highways have created enormous interest in revitalizing our urban mass transit systems. Currently much is being said and written regarding the efficacy of granting federal, state and/or local operating subsidies. In this article, the author reviews the transit industry's peak capacity problem, and questions the economic wisdom of providing operating subsidies, as some are now being provided, and how most will probably be administered in the near future. An alternative plan suggests the manner in which subsidies can eventually help the transit industry. The article concludes with an analysis of what research efforts are needed in many urban transit systems and how subsidies can be used to support such research.

AB  - Traffic congestion and transit service deterioration are becoming acute problems in China's major cities. Based on a case study of Shanghai, this paper examines the growing gap between the supply of urban transportation facilities and the demand for travel, and discusses the planning implications. Because it will take great amounts of time and resources to transform the municipal transportation infrastructure into one suitable for high level mobility and motorization, the supply side is constrained for the short term. Therefore, planning research is directed primarily to the demand side. Transportation surveys indicate that travel demand has been increasing explosively through a combination of more trips, longer trips, and mode shifts away from walk and transit. Population growth, growth of family income, urban expansion and spatial reconfiguration, the emergence of labor and housing markets, and motorization are identified as the main causal factors. The probable future effects of these factors are analyzed and policy options are explored. The paper argues that enhancing accessibility without inducing mobility should be a basic guideline for policy-making and urban planning. Given the fast pace of urban development and the important role of the municipal government in locating urban activities, land-use planning can be a highly effective means for improving accessibility. Specific land-use strategies and complementary policies are proposed. Since Shanghai is in some important ways representative of large metropolises in the developing world, the case study is potentially valuable for other cities as well.
