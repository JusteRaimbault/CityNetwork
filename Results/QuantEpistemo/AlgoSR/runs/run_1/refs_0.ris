AB  - In this contribution we describe a method to assess the activity
of vehicles based on airborne image sequences from an infrared camera.
At the resolution of approximately one meter vehicles appear as
elongated spots. In urban areas many additional other objects have the
same property. To discriminate vehicles from these objects we fuse
information from IR-images and vector-maps. Also, evidence from
overlapping areas of frames or an IR-sequence is accumulated in the
scene. We also perform grouping of vehicles into rows along the margins
of the roads. These tasks can be automatically performed by a production
net. The generic productions for grouping become feasible through the
use of map knowledge as context

AB  - The paper assumes that the general relationship between transportation and land-use may be defined in terms of three primary components: (1) Economic activity (i.e. employment), (2) Demographic activity and (3) Transportation facilities. After a brief introductory section, the second section of the paper contains a review of the state of the art models of economic activity location i.e. intra-urban employment forecasting. The third section of the paper contains a review of the state of the art of models of demographic activity location, i.e. intra-urban population forecasting. The final section of the paper begins with a brief description of urban transportation network models. The section and paper are then concluded with a discussion of possible integrated land-use and transportation model packages.

AB  - Much of the current concern with sustainable transportation focuses on the alleged ills of the automotive industry. Global warming and a range of detrimental impacts are attributed to increased atmospheric concentrations of automotive emissions. Within Canada, various groups have attempted to achieve consensus on a variety of policies and measures intended to reduce automobile dependence. This paper is based on the premise that, from the standpoint of sustainability, the key goals for urban transportation involve first, reducing total vehicle-km of travel by altering both average trip lengths and modal split and, second, improving fuel efficiency by technological means. After examining the range of policy instruments available to achieve these goals, the highest priority policies are identified in terms of their likelihood of moving Canadian cities to more sustainable forms of land use and transportation development.

AB  - The NIES Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology (NICE) model was applied to the Biliu River catchment, northern China, to estimate the carrying capacity of the water resource there. The model reproduced well the water and heat budgets after the construction of a reservoir in the middle reach of the river. It also correctly backcasted the degradation of water resources such as river discharge and groundwater after the completion of the reservoir. Calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from satellite data clearly showed vegetation degradation downstream of the reservoir. Statistical analysis of a decoupling indicator based on the simulated water carrying capacity and on the satellite data of vegetation index indicated that water-related stress in Dalian city, where the economy has grown rapidly after the completement of the reservoir, has increased in accordance with the environmental degradation below the reservoir. The results indicate a close relationship between water resource and economic growth, which has greatly affected ecosystem degradation and its serious burden on the environment in the catchment. The simulated results highlight the linkage between urban development in Dalian and sustainable water resource management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.

AB  - This paper describes a model for assessing national urban transportation policy alternatives and its application in the 1974 National Transportation Study in the U.S. This multimodal version of the TRANS-Urban model system employs an aggregate modelling technique which treats each urban area as a single analysis unit. Given a level and mix of funds, the model calculates the amount of highway and transit facilities, travel demand by mode, system performance, and external impacts such as fatalities, land consumed, air pollution, dislocations and energy consumed. The model was applied to assess the effects of alternative funding and pricing policies for the 64 largest urbanized areas.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  - Trips involving more than one stop before returning home comprise a quarter to a third of all urban travel. A high degree of similarity exists in the pattern of flow for various trip purposes because of a common dependence on the spatial arrangement of activities. Linkages among activity on a single trip, stemming from a savings in transport inputs, are also related to the areal pattern of activities and most frequently involve clustered business and commercial land uses. Several sections of the Lansing metropolitan area (used in the empirical analysis) have strong local linkages among trip purposes, but the city also has a considerable volume of spatially diffused multiple-purpose trip flows.

AB  - Dean’s Words Mohinder Singh Dean LTA Academy 2 012 has continued to see sustained effort in urban transport research, planning and development all over the world. We see evidence of this in the contributions to this issue of JOURNEYS, and even during some of the presentations made at the 3rd World Cities Summit held in Singapore in July this year. A highlight of the four day biennial event was the Flagship Urban Solutions Track (FUST) series of discussions which also explored the successes and challenges of various urban transport solutions. We are pleased to feature excerpts from one of those discussions, namely, Mobile Cities – In Search of New Urban Mobility Systems, here. Also, Dr Carlos Dora and Jamie Hosking, collaborating under the auspices of the World Health Organization, present an insightful review on the various ways urban transport directly and indirectly affects our overall health. Their findings are not confined to just physical health, but also examine other areas that have an impact on our well-being, including access to employment, education and recreation. From the portals of Demographia, a public policy firm in St Louis, USA, Wendell Cox questions the long-held and popular belief that lower density cities have longer average work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion compared to more compact cities. He puts forward several key evidence, arguments and analyses to show that the opposite is true – that higher urban densities are associated with longer work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion. London’s splendid showing during the 2012 Olympics is largely underscored by a well- planned public transportation strategy that ensured everyone arrived everywhere on time, with minimal disruption to the city’s daily business routine. The strategy leveraged on a Travel Demand Management programme christened Travel Advice for Business (TAB). Chris Hanley of Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was part of the team that delivered the TAB programme and shares exactly how it was done with a detailed account in this volume. Dr Wong Yiik Diew and Koh Puay Ping at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University provide a detailed examination of cycling mores in Singapore. They trace its evolution from an initially popular transport mode which was later relegated to being ‘the poor man’s transport’ and its current re-emergence as green transportation in an energy and environment conscious age. They also present the findings of a survey that revealed the preferences and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians affected by them. The survey findings could be useful in directing and determining the future of cycling culture in Singapore. The Land Transport Authority’s Mageret Ely and AECOM’s Elaine Brick continue the discussion on the topic of cycling in the final article, but from a more global perspective. Focusing on the growing popularity and success of bike-sharing schemes in three cities, namely, Paris, New York and Copenhagen, they outline how strategic policy, network planning, education and awareness contribute to the growth of such programmes. The various authors for this volume have generously given their time and talent to help improve our understanding of so many areas in urban transportation development and planning, and helped us to have a new outlook to old issues. They have provided invaluable insight and simultaneously demonstrated how we can never assume that convention cannot be challenged and ingenious solutions are inconceivable. For that, I most surely thank them and trust you will find this volume an enjoyable read. Before signing off, I would like to give you a sneak peek at what JOURNEYS 2013 will hold. We shall be producing one bumper volume in 2013, as a commemorative issue for the upcoming inaugural LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) 2013.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urban sprawl is a potential environmental influence on youth overweight/obesity. However, little is known about the association between urban sprawl and behaviours that influence obesity such as active transportation and physical activity.\n\nMETHODS: The study population consisted of 7,017 respondents aged 12 to 19 to the 2007/2008 Canadian Community Health Survey, living in Canada's 33 census metropolitan areas (CMAs). Factor analysis was used to obtain an urban sprawl score for each CMA, incorporating dwelling density, percentage of single or detached dwelling units, and percentage of the population living in the urban core. Multi-level logistic regression examined whether urban sprawl was associated with frequent active transportation (30 or more minutes a day), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (60 or more minutes a day), and overweight/obesity.\n\nRESULTS: Urban sprawl was associated with active transportation among 12- to 15-year-olds, with the relative odds of engaging in at least 30 minutes of active transportation per day increasing by 24% (95% CI: 10-39%) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in the urban sprawl score. For the entire sample aged 12 to 19, higher urban sprawl was associated with MVPA (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), but not with overweight/obesity (odds ratio per SD increase = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.94-1.18).\n\nINTERPRETATION: Urban sprawl was associated with active transportation and MVPA in Canadian youth, although in the opposite direction to what has been reported in the literature for adults.

AB  - What determines urban growth and how do these factors vary globally? An understanding of the factors that drive urban spatial form will be critical for urban-and ultimately environmental-sustainability. We hypothesize that easy access to economic or social activity is a primary driver of urban form. From this, a city's spatial form is largely determined by the time-cost of access to transportation and activities. We use a stochastic pixel-based model to test the hypothesis of accessibility-driven urban growth using two case studies: Silicon Valley, U.S., and Bangalore, India. This study is the first to develop a spatially explicit modeling approach to urban growth in a comparative framework spanning the developed and developing world. Our analysis shows that Silicon Valley's relatively inexpensive auto-based transport (in time and financial costs), dispersed employment locations, and high labor force participation rates have resulted in intermittent and expansive highway-oriented urban growth patterns. In contrast, Bangalore's expensive non-auto transport (in time and financial costs), low participation in the formal economy, and emphasis on informal economic activity has produced a tighter clustering of urban development near existing urban locations. Over time, generally decreasing transport costs in both locations have led to increased dispersion of urban development. Economic growth in India and the inflows of IT-related foreign investment in Bangalore may further create urban forms increasingly similar to those found in the Silicon Valley. The results have important implications for the development of policies that may lead to more sustainable forms of urban development. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the past decades, the city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia has witnessed dramatic changes in its urban area, population and transportation. To better understand the relationship between urban growth and transportation, this paper aims to quantify and analyze the spatial-temporal relationship between urban growth and transportation for Jeddah using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) approaches. In this paper, eight urban growth and transportation indices were developed to analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal urban growth and transportation changes: (1) annual urban spatial expansion index, (2) land use change index, (3) population density index, (4) transportation infrastructure expansion index, (5) road density index, (6) road area density index, (7) urban trips density index, and (8) modal split change index. The results show that in the past four decades (1964-2007), Jeddah has experienced a rapid population growth, a large spatial expansion, rapidly changing land use and expanding transportation infrastructure. As transportation infrastructure expands with population growth, this expansion has not been able to accommodate increases in travel demand. This has led to an increase in urban congestion. The analysis further shows that transportation infrastructure expansion has stimulated Jeddah's urban spatial expansion and residential area growth. The enormous spatial expansion has also caused significant changes in the daily share of travel modes. The developed indicators in the paper bridge the knowledge gap between urban growth and transportation research, as the results of this study provide a rich understanding of the relationship between urban growth and transportation in rapidly growing cities. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gametogenic activity, growth, mortality and somatic production of an unexploited population of Pinctada imbricata from the Cabo de la Vela (Guajira, Colombian Caribbean, 12??10'N, 72??20'W) was studied. P. imbricata exhibits a continuous gametogenic cycle with a 5-month period (January to June) of high gametogenic activity. Gametogenesis is inversely correlated to temperature, suggesting a relation between spawning and upwelling-induced food availability. Final growth parameters according to the von Bertalanffy-growth equation, estimated from tagging-recapture data, were L(??) = 84.0 mm and K = 0.939 year-1; total mortality, corresponding to natural mortality M, was calculated as Z = 2.687 year-1. The P/B-ratio for this population estimated with the weight specific growth rate method was 1.515. From the results, it was generally concluded that P. imbricata has a large aquaculture potential in this region owing to its continuous gametogenic cycle, and a high growth and production rate.

AB  - North American cities have undergone dramatic changes over the last century. Locations that were once inconvenient have become accessible through extensive road networks leading to population decentralization from the traditional urban centre to suburbia, creating polycentric sprawls from once monocentric communities. Hamilton, Ontario is one such city. The decentralization and urban decline of the city is widely attributed to sprawling development. This change in the sociospatial structure creates challenges for transportation planners as we see greater automobile dependency, greater commuting distances and increased congestion. Smart growth policies such as urban residential intensification (URI) aim to increase population densities in the urban core. This exploratory study estimates the benefits of such policies from a transportation aspect. It is predicted that the City of Hamilton will experience household growth of approximately 80,000 households over the period 2005–2031. Using IMULATE, an integrated urban transportation and land-use model, a variety of development scenarios model this anticipated growth. Changes in vehicular emissions, traffic congestion and energy consumption as a result of URI are examined. Models of the land-use/transportation relationship demonstrate how increasing population densities within a city's urban centre drastically reduce congestion, emissions and gasoline consumption.

AB  - A framework is presented for evaluating the accessibility of urban networks to the transportation needs in urban areas. Accessibility has been defined from the point of view of the network configuration and its relationship to key factors influencing travel demand. The definition is a departure from the traditional methods of accessibility, which primarily describe the interaction of people and places. The definition in this study helps in assessing the interaction between the trip maker and the transportation network, thus helping in an evaluation of the utility of the network to trips in a study region. The methodology uses the computational capabilities of a geographic information system and relates them to the traditional urban transportation planning process. Specific indexes are presented to quantify the accessibility of the network with respect to key factors influencing trip production and attraction. The methodology presented is applicable to the analysis of accessibility of other transportation system networks and to comparisons of the accessibilities of networks of different urban areas.

AB  - Neighbourhood activity spaces have been the subject of a significant amount of research and evaluation in Western Europe and the US. However, it is predictable that the situation in the neighbourhoods of Eastern Europe is different, especially in regard to those built during the Soviet era. Beginning with the assumption that the city planning ideas and ideals of the communist period are still present in urban space, the author explores daily activity spaces and attitudes of inhabitants towards them in the neighbourhood of Mezciems, which was planned and built during the Soviet era in the city of Riga, the capital of Latvia. In order to find out the ways the inhabitants perceive and use the space in a post-Soviet neighbourhood, as well as the ways in which they make the neighbourhood more liveable for themselves, the author uses semi-structured in-depth interviews with, and maps drawn by long-standing residents of the Mezciems neighbourhood. The results show that it is possible to mark out two lifestyles of long-standing residents during the Soviet era neighbourhood, characterized by different attitudes towards the functions available in the post-Soviet neighbourhood. At the same time, the spaces used, as well as the ideas about improvements that would make the post-Soviet neighbourhood space more enjoyable for them are quite similar within these two groups of people, characterized by different lifestyles.

AB  - In appreciation of the fact that longer-run considerations are particularly important in the development of urban transportation, during the past three decades American transportation planning has been employing increasingly sophisticated approaches to the future. This article discusses four phases in this evolution, with a given focus dominant in each period. During the first period, following on the initial provision of federal government funds for the construction of highways in and around cities, major reliance was based on simple projections of travel demand in metropolitan regions, based mainly on current patterns. This was followed by an approach which focused on an analysis of impacts on transportation systems of projected land uses, based on forecasts of population and economic growth for a target year, on the assumption that facilities were to be provided to move all vehicles that wanted to move from here to there at least possible cost. The third period was characterized by an increasing consciousness of the value of articulating national and local goals in making transportation decisions, going beyond narrow economic and mobility objectives, and including the notion of trade-offs among goals. The most recent period discussed is one characterized by rising interest in futures studies, using methods such as "Delphi" and cross-impact analysis and approaches such as "alternative futures," as well as a search for achieving flexibility in transportation development and for means of limiting resource commitment in the face of the uncertain- ties of the future ("keeping options open"). It is pointed out that we still have a long way to go in learning how to evolve feasible images of the future, with associated explicit urban life-style goals, that come to grips with societal variety and conflicting interests.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - Perhaps the most apparent transportation planning and urban development\nproblems that have over the years received attention of, and yet\ncontinue to pose challenges to policy makers, are the need to provide\nsustainable public transport system and revitalisation of distorted\nsocio-economic policies. The pressure created by rapid population growth\nof Lagos on transport infrastructure and services in the city is indeed\ngreat that decline in quality and quantity of services are inevitable\nand uncertain. The persistent trials and errors in the urban public\ntransportation policy resulted to the introduction of the three wheeler\nvehicular mode of public transportation in the metropolis of about 11\nmillion people.\nSince the vehicles hit the streets of Lagos about two years ago, many\nunder-employed graduates were put in business, many un-educated citizens\nincapacitated by poverty-stricken background got something to do, while\nshort-distanced commuters, who hitherto had made their trip on foot or\nmotorcycle had relief. These gains were, however, over shadowed by the\nrelatively small size of the vehicle (officially three passengers full\ncapacity) that made it uncomfortable for many passengers, its fragile\nnature inability to withstand the restlessness and aggressive nature of\nLagos commuters, emissions from within and other vehicles, engine noise\nfrom within and other vehicles continuously give passengers persistent\ndiscomfort. More importantly, the adoption of the mode for public\ntransport with its attendant limited occupancy restraint design put many\npassengers at risk and made the mode unsafe at any speed.\nThis paper examines the policy background of the introduction of this\nmode of public transportation in the most populated city in the African\ncontinent and discusses in details the transport-related pollution\nimplications of its use on the environment and the urban passengers and\npopulation. The overall concern of the government driven and dominant\ncontrol of public transportation systems in rapidly growing Nigerian\ncities is highlighted and the some policy suggestion advanced towards\nensuring a more effectively sustained public transport systems and urban\nenvironment.

This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

But “new urbanists” are intent on changing preferences and behavior, and they have captured the urban transportation planning process in places like Portland.

AB  - This article focuses on the ways that gender-related roles affect the daily travel-activity patterns of a sample of Swedish urbanites. We use data of twelve measures to compare the travel-activity patterns of men and women employed full-time. The results of the analyses indicate that traditional gender roles remain in force even when the women of the household are employed full-time outside the home.

AB  - This paper explores aggregate mobile network data that is real-time and dynamic to reveal urban activities. The principle, method and algorithm of dividing traffic analysis zones (TAZ) and mobile network zones are discussed, a mathematical model of assigning call volume data from mobile network zones to TAZ is established and the corresponding programming process is introduced. Xiangfan is taken as a case study to indicate similarity of mobile phone traffic intensity and person travel survey when the approach is applied. This relativity is of significance to explore and reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of urban activities. Additionally, mobile phone data overcomes disadvantages of the lag, high cost and limitation in quantity of person travel survey. Generally, mobile network data has the features that are refreshing fast, easy to collect, widely used and available in mobile services.

AB  - Several innovative transportation concepts were critical components of the early twentieth-century City Beautiful reconfiguration of built environments: orderly public places, suitable for important civic buildings; clear hierarchies of streets, avenues, and boulevards, organized in rational patterns with orchestrated vistas; and new terminals that housed improved intercity rail facilities and enhanced intracity travel through improved multimodal surface transportation connections. The City Beautiful aesthetic approach to conceiving urban circulation networks was an important and often overlooked contribution to transportation planning, and improving urban transportation was an important goal for City Beautiful reformers. A review of historical planning documents and project descriptions suggests that civic leaders' approaches to improving urban circulation during the City Beautiful era are enduring contributions of the movement's integrated approach to land use and transportation planning and its desire to transform cities into more beautiful places.

AB  - A large number of techniques for conserving energy in urban passenger transport are described. A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the "smart growth" movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of "smart growth", discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the "smart growth" label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan "smart growth") is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of "smart growth". ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - ‘Urban growth’ refers to the process of growth and decline of economic agglomerations. The pattern of concentration of economic activity and its evolution have been found to be an important determinant, and in some cases the result, of urbanization, the structure of cities, the organization of economic activity, and national economic growth. The size distribution of cities is the result of the patterns of urbanization, which result in city growth and city creation. The evolution of the size distribution of cities is in turn closely linked to national economic growth.

AB  - Sporisorium reilianum, the fungus that causes sorghum head smut, was grown with sucrose, lactose, trehalose or raffinose in liquid suspension or on a solid medium. Liquid culture media were analyzed for hydrolysis products of these carbohydrates to determine extracellular enzyme activity of the fungus. Increased amounts of glucose and fructose in the culture medium of S. reilianum grown with sucrose or raffinose indicated that invertase (beta-fructofuranosidase, 3.2.1.26) activity was present. No evidence of extracellular galactosidase or trehalase activity was found. Enhanced sporidial colony formation on carbohydrates that can be hydrolyzed to hexoses, and specific forms of mycelial growth on lactose, trehalose or on a carbohydrate-deficient medium might suggest that mycelial growth is a way to foraging for food sources. However, the rapid and profuse mycelial growth on the host cell wall glycoprotein appears to be in response to abundant food supply (probably of a different type). Therefore availability of different kinds of carbon sources in the environment of the growing fungus might determine dimorphism and associated pathogenesis by S. reilianum.

AB  - The major objective of this paper is to examine the applicability of multicriteria evaluation methods to automobile restraint types of transportation projects. The examination was performed through applying the three multicriteria evaluation methods--concordance analysis, the goals-achievement matrix and the compromise solution--to automobile restraint policies in the context of Seoul, Korea. The results of the research show that the methods employed have, despite certain drawbacks, considerable potential for assisting the decision-maker and others concerned with the transportation decision-making process. Their major advantage over traditional transportation evaluation methods is that they allow the consideration of a wider range of costs and benefits. The empirical analysis also illustrates the usefulness of including qualitative criteria into the evaluation framework without transforming them to a monetary dimension.

AB  - The structure and layout of an urban transportation network have decisive effects on urban logistics operation efficiency. The traditional optimization models for an urban road transportation network usually focuses on the urban passenger-traffic efficiency maximization, but have not considered the urban road transportation network influencing the urban logistics system. Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model. Then the authors introduce the Genetic-Simulated annealing algorithms to solve the proposed model. © ASCE.

AB  - The effect of a three-dimensional replacement of urban thermal environment activity is discussed on the basis of numerical simulation with a mesoscale climate model. Given a three-dimensional replacement of urban activity, greater concentration decreased surface air temperatures. Such concentration is apparently effective for modifying the thermal environment during the daytime, while the reduction of energy consumption is more effective during the night-time. Through sensitivity analysis, it is shown that building width and height variations with associated drag effects modify the environment near the ground.

A survey of all urban transportation-related editorials appearing in a sample of 155 U.S. newspapers during a period of 19 months in 1973-74 revealed that a number of issues related to transit financing, transit and highway investment, bicycles, and the transportation planning process were currently under debate in the urban press. This paper presents the survey's findings regarding the incidence and viewpoint of articles on these and other issues. Transit financing concerns clearly emerged as the most frequently discussed, and some agreement in editorial viewpoint was also found.

AB  - Home to the New York Yankees, the Bronx Zoo, and the Grand Concourse, the Bronx was at one time a haven for upwardly mobile second-generation immigrants eager to leave the crowded tenements of Manhattan in pursuit of the American dream. Once hailed as a "wonder borough" of beautiful homes, parks, and universities, the Bronx became -- during the 1960s and 1970s -- a national symbol of urban deterioration. Thriving neighborhoods that had long been home to generations of families dissolved under waves of arson, crime, and housing abandonment, turning blocks of apartment buildings into gutted, graffiti-covered shells and empty, trash-filled lots. In this revealing history of the Bronx, Evelyn Gonzalez describes how the once-infamous New York City borough underwent one of the most successful and inspiring community revivals in American history.From its earliest beginnings as a loose cluster of commuter villages to its current status as a densely populated home for New York's growing and increasingly more diverse African American and Hispanic populations, this book shows how the Bronx interacted with and was affected by the rest of New York City as it grew from a small colony on the tip of Manhattan into a sprawling metropolis. This is the story of the clattering of elevated subways and the cacophony of crowded neighborhoods, the heady optimism of industrial progress and the despair of economic recession, and the vibrancy of ethnic cultures and the resilience of local grassroots coalitions crucial to the borough's rejuvenation. In recounting the varied and extreme transformations this remarkable community has undergone, Evelyn Gonzalez argues that it was not racial discrimination, rampant crime, postwar liberalism, or big government that was to blame for the urban crisis that assailed the Bronx during the late 1960s. Rather, the decline was inextricably connected to the same kinds of social initiatives, economic transactions, political decisions, and simple human choices that had once been central to the development and vitality of the borough. Although the history of the Bronx is unquestionably a success story, crime, poverty, and substandard housing still afflict the community today. Yet the process of building and rebuilding carries on, and the revitalization of neighborhoods and a resurgence of economic growth continue to offer hope for the future.

AB  - When aligned with other services and facilities, transportation helps generate powerful forces for influencing the long-run real-estate market. Working to improve the productivity and livability of urban areas, officials are increasingly looking to metropolitan policy studies for effective action and regulation programs. Thus, beyond immediate considerations of access and congestion, transportation decisions are now expected to reflect the impacts of governmental programs on general urban development. The processes through which transportation decisions are made are themselves being modified in recognition of the broad reverberations of transport policy. With a wider array of persons and governmental units concerned with these decisions, the criteria applied to the alternative possibilities are becoming more comprehensive. Criteria applied depend not merely on personal outlook but also on the scope of responsibilities of the person weighing the alternatives. Two opposite tendencies are at work: a search for a reduction of criteria toward a single optimizing index accounting for all significant costs and benefits implicit in a proposed line of policy and program; conversely, a search better to identify and describe all the significant manifold repercussions of alternative proposals as these are viewed by different people.

AB  - Improved criteria are necessary to aid in determining awards of federal funds for metropolitan transit projects. Commuting is the main use for public transit. Thus a prima- ry objective of an urban transit system should be to provide a flexible and balanced set of options to the workers in the metropolitan area for their journey to work. This paper discusses various facets of an appropriate balance among the three modes: rapid rail, bus, and automobile. Three cities are selected for further analysis: Baltimore, Kansas City, and Phoenix. These cities represent different stages in economic-transportation develop- ment, and also present different spatial patterns of residence and employment. The appli- cability of rapid rail transit to each city is examined in view of central city worker con- centration and recent trends.

AB  - U nder federal law, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are charged with developing transportation plans and programs to accommodate mobility needs for persons and goods within their regions. To this end, the MPOs estimate future travel demand and analyze the impacts of alternative transportation investment scenarios using comput- erized travel demand forecasting models. These models are used to estimate how urban growth and proposed facilities and the associated operational investments and transportation policies will affect mobility and the opera- tion of the transportation system. Forecasts derived from these models enable policy makers to make informed decisions on investments and poli- cies relating to the transportation system. In addition, MPOs in federally designated air quality nonattainment or maintenance areas have been given a central role in determining whether their regional transportation plans and programs conform to State Implementation Plans for meeting national air quality standards. Travel forecasting models play a principal role in this process as well. The basic modeling approach at most MPOs remains a sequential four- step process by which the number of daily trips is estimated, distributed among origin and destination zones, divided according to mode of travel, and finally assigned to highway and transit networks. The demands on forecasting models have grown significantly in recent years as a result of new policy concerns. Existing models are inadequate to address many of these new concerns.

AB  - The vast amount of available spatio-temporal data of human activities and mobility has given raise to the rapidly emerging field of urban computing/informatics. Central to the latter is understanding the dynamics of the activities that take place in an urban area (e.g., a city). This can significantly enhance functionalities such as resource and service allocation within a city. Existing literature has paid a lot of attention on spatial dynamics, with the temporal ones often being neglected and left out. However, this can lead to non-negligible implications. For instance, while two areas can appear to exhibit similar activity when the latter is aggregated in time, they can be significantly different when introducing the temporal dimension. Furthermore, even when considering a specific area X alone, the transitions of the activity that takes place within X are important themselves. Using data from the most prevalent location-based social network (LBSN for short), Foursquare, we analyze the temporal dynamics of activities in New York City and San Francisco. Our results clearly show that considering the temporal dimension provides us with a different and more detailed description of urban dynamics. We envision this study to lead to more careful and detailed consideration of the temporal dynamics when analyzing urban activities. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - A frequently suggested strategy for alleviating transportation energy shortage is to reduce travel demands by altering the patterns of land uses in cities. This paper examines this strategy by exploring the interface between urban structure, transportation energy consumption, and transportation policy. The interrelationships between travel demand and urban form are first examined, and research attempts to clarify and model these relationships are reviewed. The role of transportation as a land use development control is discussed, and the use of “transportation performance standards” is proposed as a method for integrating transportation energy considerations into land development controls and decisions.

AB  - This work extends the conceptual argument for the use of ellipses to portray activity spaces and offers one example of how the ellipse construct can be used to analyze urban travel characteristics, based on observed trip making behavior and socio-economic variables. A problem in characterizing activity spaces has been in integrating the time and space dimensions into the same analytical framework while maintaining an understandable graphical representation of the space-time geographies envisioned by Hagerstrand and others. The ellipse allows this, as well as providing several quantifiable measures to be used for analyzing and characterizing activity spaces and urban travel behavior. In the current application, analysis of variance is used to analyze the resulting elliptic variables of 653 travelers. The results indicate that home location and house- hold size are important factors in determining activity space characteristics and that the ellipse variables provide a different and useful approach for understanding urban travel behavior.

AB  - Research in transportation, urban design, and planning has examined associations between physical environment variables and individuals' walking and cycling for transport. Constructs, methods, and findings from these fields can be applied by physical activity and health researchers to improve understanding of environmental influences on physical activity. In this review, neighborhood environment characteristics proposed to be relevant to walking/cycling for transport are defined, including population density, connectivity, and land use mix. Neighborhood comparison and correlational studies with nonmotorized transport outcomes are considered, with evidence suggesting that residents from communities with higher density, greater connectivity, and more land use mix report higher rates of walking/cycling for utilitarian purposes than low-density, poorly connected, and single land use neighborhoods. Environmental variables appear to add to variance accounted for beyond sociodemographic predictors of walking/cycling for transport. Implications of the transportation literature for physical activity and related research are outlined. Future research directions are detailed for physical activity research to further examine the impact of neighborhood and other physical environment factors on physical activity and the potential interactive effects of psychosocial and environmental variables. The transportation, urban design, and planning literatures provide a valuable starting point for multidisciplinary research on environmental contributions to physical activity levels in the population.

AB  - Accelerated population growth in general and an increasing expanse and intensity of metropolitan development through- out the world have focused attention on urban transportation and growth management. The high cost of urban highways and mass transit systems, coupled with the necessity of guiding private use of land toward acceptable levels of rational development, have resulted in various urban investment strategies. Among these, the concept of joint development of transportation facilities and high activity nodes has emerged as a promising solution to problems of overcrowding and congestion in major cities in Europe, Asia and the Americas. Such integrated public and private investment not only tends to maximize the cost effectiveness of required facilities, but offers opportunities benefit of the public at large and as an incentive for risk capital investment. A comprehensive study was undertaken by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning of Texas A&M University to examine the requisites of effective joint development in selected metropolitan areas, including Toronto and Montreal, Canada; Washington, DC, San Francisco and Atlanta in the USA; and Paris, France. In all instances, it was found that fixed guideway rapid transit had a discernible, positive impact on urban growth and intra-urban transportation, opportunities provided versely, it was confirmed that effective application of this strategy required the pre-existence of economic viability in general, and in the specific transportation for imaginative growth management and was, indeed, a major inducement for private investment.

They include integrated public-private planning and construction; pedestrian flow orienta- tion with respect to station entrances and exits: complete control of land ownership; attractive terms and conditions for lease and related arrangement; zoning stability; availability of infrastructure when needed; trade area conditions; an aes- thetically pleasing environment with appropriate architectural and landscape architectural treatment of all facilities and grounds; a cooperative, constructive attitude by all parties.

AB  - An analysis of data of the past few decades from cities around the world indicates that history is repeating itself. Although there are significant differences in socioeconomic and technological characteristics among these cities, a remarkable similarity exists in trends in urban transportation. The current growth in the use of automobiles in many cities of developing countries follows similar trends experienced in the United States and other developed countries several decades earlier. Even though there is much awareness and knowledge about sustainability, private vehicle ownership, and use continue to grow at an increasing pace with rising personal incomes and desires to experience faster and more reliable transportation technology. Urban density, expressed in number of people and/or jobs per unit of land, is the key indicator of the level of automobile ownership and use, and of associated parameters of sustainability. As personal incomes rise, choice of residential and job location increases, causing a decrease in urban density and affecting the relative use of private transportation and public transit. There are policy options related to land use, pricing, and technological factors that can have far reaching influence on the long-term sustainability of urban-transportation systems around the world. The basic implication of the analysis is that urban-transportation sustainability can be greatly enhanced if there are profound changes in urban structures and activities that can slow or reverse the growth in the use of private automobiles and can make transit and other modes attractive and viable.

AB  - The euryhaline milkfish (Chanos chanos) is an excellent subject for studies of the physiological and behavioral processes involved in salinity adaptation. In this study, energy partitioning for metabolism, activity and growth, maximal activity performance and blood osmotic concentrations were assessed at two activity levels in juvenile milkfish fed equal rations and maintained at a relatively constant temperature (262 C) and at salinities (15, 35 and 55 ?) that represented a wide range of osmoregulatory challenges. Changes in the measured parameters were not consistently related to the magnitude of the trans-integumentary osmotic gradients. Routine oxygen consumption rates were high in 35 ? salinity (mean 1 s.e.m. 1678 mg O2 kg-1 h-1) and comparably low in 15 and 55 ? salinity (1336 and 1273 mg O2 kg-1 h-1, respectively). Routine activity levels (relative swimming velocity) were highest in 35 ? salinity (0. 960.04 L s-1), where L is standard length, intermediate in 15 ? salinity (0.770.03 L s-1) and lowest in 55 ? salinity (0.670.03 L s-1). Growth was significantly higher in 55 ? salinity (3.40.2 % increase in wet body mass per day) than in 35 ? salinity (2.40.2 % increase per day) and intermediate in 15 ? salinity (2.90.5 % increase per day). Maximum swimming velocities decreased with increases in salinity, from 9.90.7 L s-1 in 15 ? salinity to 6.60. 5 L s-1 in 55 ? salinity. Sustained swimming activity above routine levels for 2 h resulted in an increase in blood osmotic concentrations in milkfish in 55 ? salinity, but osmoregulation was re-established during the second 2 h of activity. Thus, patterns of variation in metabolic rate and growth were largely parallel to variations in routine activity although, comparing 15 and 55 ? salinity, elevated maintenance costs for osmoregulation at the high salinity were detectable. Reduced osmoregulatory abilities and reductions in maximal swimming performance suggest that high salinity may constrain activity. The results demonstrate that investigations of salinity adaptation in euryhaline fishes should take into account the interactive effects of salinity on physiology and behavior.

These can be located in open countryside on virgin land, or they can grow around existing small towns, all in conjunction with the construction of an innovative personal transportation system. In this paper a hexagonal modular structure, in which self-contained urban units can be combined and added to over time, is proposed as a new urban form and AVCS maglev - which will serve the new cities efficiently - is proposed as a key transportation strategy.

AB  - Several urban transportation systems are compared on the basis of the energy resources consumed in the manufacture of their vehicle and guideway systems and in their operation. Four systems, the auto, bus, rapid rail and personal rapid transit, are extensively analyzed, while the energy characteristics of dial-a-ride systems and the motorcycle are estimated. Analyses of bicycling and walking are also included for a comparison of motorized modes with human propulsion systems. For each system the energy required to manufacture a vehicle, the energy required to manufacture the guideway, and energy of operation are estimated. The average energy consumed per available seat-mile is calculated to compare the system when they are operating at capacity. An example containing assumed average occupancy levels gives a more realistic comparision on the basis of energy consumed per passenger-mile.

AB  - Purpose: Findings from prospective studies on associations between physical activity and adiposity among youth are inconsistent. Our aim was to describe physical activity trajectories during secondary school and examine the association with change in adiposity in youth. Methods: Physical activity was measured in 20 survey cycles from 1999 to 2005; anthropometrics were measured in survey cycles 1, 12, and 19. Individual growth curves modeling moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) were estimated. Estimates of initial level and rate of decline in MVPA and VPA bouts per week were included as potential predictors of body fat% and body mass index using age- and sex-specific linear regression. Results: Complete data were available for 840 and 760 adolescents aged 12-13 years at baseline, followed from survey cycles 1-12 and 12-19, respectively. Among girls, yearly declines of one MVPA and one VPAbout per week during earlier adolescence were associated with increases of 0.19 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.36) and 0.47 (95% CI, 0.015-0.92) units of body fat%, respectively. In boys, a yearly decline ofone MVPA bout per week was associated with an increase of 0.38 (95% CI, 0.05-0.70) units of body fat%during later adolescence. Conclusions: Obesity prevention programs should include strategies to prevent declines in physical activity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper is concerned with patterns of urban development and their evaluation, prediction, and prescription using mathematical models. A utility maximizing model which incorporates diversity of benefits within each allocation option is introduced. This diversity also affects dispersal of activities among zones and is related to cost differences and trip distributions between zones. The degree of diversity is affected by the influence of the different parties in the location decision process, by different levels of planning control, and by different transport and communications futures, and the consequences of these factors on patterns of development and on utility are examined.

AB  - Cities play a vital role in promoting economic growth and prosperity. The develop- ment of cities largely depends upon their physical, social, and institutional infrastruc- ture. In this context, the importance of intraurban transportation is paramount. This article provides an overview of urban transport issues in India. Rather than covering every aspect of urban transportation, it primarily focuses on those areas that are important from a policy point of view. The article first reviews the trends of vehicular growth and availability of transport infrastructure in Indian cities. This is followed by a discussion on the nature and magnitude of urban transport problems such as congestion, pollution, and road accidents. Building on this background, the article proposes policy measures to improve urban transportation in India. Indian cities cannot afford to cater only to private cars and two-wheelers and there has to be a general recognition that policy should be designed in such a way that it reduces the need to travel by personalized modes and boosts public transport sys- tem. This requires both an increase in quantity as well as quality of public transport and effective use of demand as well as supply-side management measures. At the same time, people should be encouraged to walk and cycle and government should support investments that make cycling and walking safer.

AB  - This report describes and, where possible, quantifies the value of information and information services for transportation agencies. It evaluates the various means of accessing information and looks at the important role of the information professional. In 1994, the Transportation Research Board Committee A5001 on the Conduct of Research addressed the need to improve recognition of the value of information, information services, and information professionals. As a result, the Federal Highway Administration initiated a project overseen by a panel of technical experts to 1) determine the value of information and information services and 2) identify strategies for promoting information programs (included in this report as an appendix). This report documents how information services help transportation agencies operate more efficiently and effectively. Based on an extensive literature search and interviews with public- and private-sector experts, it shows that the value of information can be measured in terms of: 1) reduced costs of agency research, technology development, and operations; 2) quicker implementation of innovations and time savings, and 3) more effective decision making at all levels of the agency. The support of top management is also an indicator of the value information and information services hold within an organization. This report documents that information services are of significant value to transportation agencies. It also identifies a number of areas where existing programs and resources need to be strengthened. Recommendations for the Federal Highway Administration and its partners include: Taking the lead in building consensus on information issues and developing a national transportation information policy, Developing a national marketing action plan to raise awareness of the value of information, educate management on the need for information services, and promote information programs in transportation agencies, and Developing a comprehensive inventory of all transportation information resources and programs available nationwide.

AB  - North American cities have been evolving from monocentric to polycentric metropolitan regions, with multiple concentrations of activities occurring outside of traditional urban cores. This new urban structure, with multiple urban "activity centers," has profound influence on the functioning of cities, particularly transportation systems. This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incorporates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed methodology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria. The impact of these "transportation activity centers" on Philadelphia's travel patterns is explored.

AB  - The distribution of mercury in sediments of the Patos Lagoon estuary and nearby coastal marine deposits has been investigated for the period 1998-2008. Polluted urban soils and coastal reclamation fills are the principal sources of high mercury concentrations for shallow estuarine sediments. The shallow sediments that form near the urban area enter the navigation canal and are transported into the ocean. The mercury concentration in sediments of the navigation canal has considerably increased since 2004, due to intense reconstruction activity in the urban area. Periodic dredging of the canal strengthens the preconditions for coastal marine sediment contamination by mercury. However, this does not occur because the resuspended dredged sediments are significantly diluted by natural suspended particulate matter.

The strengths and limitations of present static control technology and current computer traffic signal and freeway surveillance and control systems in urban areas are described. A taxonomy of possible information and control configurations in urban traffic operations is developed. The alternatives in the taxonomy are analysed and used as the basis for recommending specific real time information and control functions for improving, in an evolutionary manner, the performance of urban ground transportation systems. The recommended improvements would allow for the first time a meaningful substitution of operational control for physical (static) capacity increases in urban transportation.

AB  - A fundamental public policy decision implicitly addressed by agencies responsible for urban transportation planning is the right of the individual versus the goal of the community. This question arises in considering the role that state and local officials should play within the context of transportation and land development, specifically the &quot;smart growth&quot; movement. Although there is no universally accepted definition of &quot;smart growth&quot;, discrete actions being implemented or advocated under that rubric reveal that smart growth is viewed as a range of regulatory, financial, and educational practices that may help to coordinate transportation and land use through integrated planning. Practices helpful in this coordination include communications, consensus-building, and legislative efforts that improve dialog, reduce polarization, and enable coordination of transportation and land use decisions. None of these practices require use of the &quot;smart growth&quot; label: instead, they expose tangible initiatives that can be publicly debated. Only when referring to specific initiatives (rather than the general slogan &quot;smart growth&quot;) is it fair to ask a community or an organization to take a position on the issue of individual autonomy versus communal desires. This paper discusses critical policy issues facing agencies responsible for land use planning, reviews organizational approaches to resolving smart growth issues, and suggests practices to enhance community participation by delineating tangible components of &quot;smart growth&quot;.

AB  - Location-based check-in services in various social media applications have enabled individuals to share their activity-related choices providing a new source of human activity data. Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users' weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper serves as an introduction to this special issue on new developments in urban transportation planning. The papers in this issue highlight how physical mobility is still an essential priority for urban life, but that there are associated costs in the terms of environmental impacts, quality of life and economic performance of cities. Four features of the emerging urban transportation field are identified. The first defining feature is that it is a discipline in the midst of a paradigmatic transition. Second is its overarching aim of achieving sustainable urban mobility as part of a broader effort towards enhancing quality of life in cities. The third feature is the emphasis on collaboration, integration and exchange with other professions and policy sectors. The last distinctive feature is the recognition that urban transportation planning is a communication-oriented activity.

AB  - The development of the nervous system takes place in two main steps: first an extensive preliminary network is formed and then it is pruned and trimmed to establish the final form. This refinement is achieved by mechanisms that include cell death, selective growth and loss of neurites and the stabilization and elimination of synapses. The focus of this review is on selective neurite retraction during development, with particular emphasis on the role of electrical activity. In many developing vertebrate and invertebrate neurones, the frequency and duration of ongoing impulse activity determine the final arborizations and the pattern of connections. When impulse traffic is silenced, axons fail to retract branches that had grown to inappropriate destinations in the mammalian visual system, cerebellum and neuromuscular junctions. Similarly, in crustaceans, Drosophila melanogaster and leeches, refinements in axonal morphology during development are influenced by impulse activity. From experiments made in culture, it has been possible to mimic these events and to show a clear link between the density of voltage-activated calcium channels in a neurite and its retraction following stimulation. The distribution of these calcium channels in turn is determined by the substratum with which the neurites are in contact or by the formation of synapses. Several lines of evidence suggest that calcium entry into the growth cone leads to collapse by disruption of actin filaments. One candidate for coupling membrane events to neurite retraction is the microfilament-associated protein gelsolin which, in its calcium-activated state, severs actin filaments. Open questions that remain concern the differential effects of activity on dendrites and axons as well as the mechanisms by which the growth cone integrates information derived from stimuli in the cell and in the extracellular environment.

AB  - `Urban activity patterns' are spatial and temporal patterns of human activities in urban areas. As people pursue activities at multiple locations, trips are produced between successive activity locations. Patterns formed by trips over a period, such as a day, are called `travel patterns.' Characteristics of activity and travel patterns and analytical approaches taken in previous studies that examined them are summarized in this article. Discussions are organized into the following subject areas: time allocation, activity duration, time of day characteristics of activity engagement, activity sequencing, activity and travel, typologies of activity-travel patterns, urban travel pattern characteristics, trip chaining, interpersonal linkages, day-to-day variability, and behavioral dynamics.

AB  - Background Cities are expanding and accommodating an increasing proportion of the world's population. It is important to identify features of urban form that promote the health of city dwellers. Access to green space has been associated with health benefits at both individual and neighbourhood level. We investigated whether a relationship between green space coverage and selected mortality rates exists at the city level in the USA. Methods An ecological cross-sectional study. A detailed land use data set was used to quantify green space for the largest US cities (n=49, combined population of 43 million). Linear regression models were used to examine the association between city-level 'greenness' and city-level standardised rates of mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer, motor vehicle fatalities and all causes, after adjustment for confounders. Results There was no association between greenness and mortality from heart disease, diabetes, lung cancer or automobile accidents. Mortality from all causes was significantly higher in greener cities. Conclusions While considerable evidence suggests that access to green space yields health benefits, we found no such evidence at the scale of the American city. In the USA, greener cities tend also to be more sprawling and have higher levels of car dependency. Any benefits that the green space might offer seem easily eclipsed by these other conditions and the lifestyles that accompany them. The result merits further investigation as it has important implications for how we increase green space access in our cities.

In addition to the formulation of the mathematical structure of the model, the paper reports on the development of the solution algorithm, and some preliminary tests indicating rapid model convergence and minimal computational costs. These tests also reveal that transportation energy cost is an important variable in determining metropolitan structure and the location of urban activities.

While it is recognized that energy is not yet as decisive a factor in the determination of household and firm locational patterns as other factors such as accessibility and time costs, the model attempts to resolve land allocation problems by means of minimizing total transportation energy costs alone. Such an analysis may serve as a benchmark against which other policies and their energy repercussions could and should be measured.

AB  - The transportation - urban form nexus lies at the heart of urban sustainability. Transportation provides the physical connectivity between people, firms and activities that permits economic and social interactions to occur. It also provides physical definition to urban areas in terms of the street system and our perceptions of how locations "connect" in space and time. And the accessibility to opportunities that it provides influences land development decisions and location choices of households and businesses. In particular, as urban areas continue to expand, automobile-dominated transportation systems both facilitate and promote inefficient "sprawl" that has ramifications for all elements of urban physical and social infrastructure (water, handling of wastes, schools, heath care, etc.) in addition to the transportation system per se. Urban form (i.e., the spatial distribution of people, businesses and other activities), in turn, fundamentally determines both travel demand and the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of transportation. Most notably, public transit systems (as well as non-motorised modes of travel such as walking and bicycles) can only provide effective alternatives to the automobile if transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban forms are built. Transportation systems are major generators of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise. They are also almost totally dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels as their source of energy. This paper sketches the broad dimensions of the modern urban transportation design problem, with emphasis on its connections with other elements of urban design, particularly the question of urban form. These dimensions include both physical infrastructure and services (roads, transit services, etc.) and the intelligent operational control of these facilities and services. Elements of a coordinated research program to address pressing short- and long-run urban transportation planning problems are then outlined.

AB  - China's population was 1.1 billion in 1990; it is expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2000. Its urban population was 33% in 1990 and is expected to grow to 47% by 2000. This enormous urban growth poses tremendous challenges to urban transportation planners. The five magacities-Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Wuhan-are planning for light rail transit/subway (LRT/MRT) systems that will cost $10 billion to $15 billion (U.S. dollars). However, China does not have the money and will depend on foreign aid and borrowing. Concurrently planners disagree about the appropriate role of motorized and nonmotorized transportation, especially the bicycle: some wish to abolish, restrict, or redirect it, and others wish to expand its systems role. The global LRT/MRT experience suggests that such systems are expensive and take a long time to build. Forecasting systems for cost and ridership are unreliable; actual costs are more than two or three times the forecast. The urban transportation trends and issues in China are discussed on the basis of a very diverse array of data research sources. The analysis includes mode splits, costs, and reliability functions, and their applicability to Chinese cities. It proposes a strategic planning framework for Chinese urban areas, focusing on optimum modal mixes, investment and regulatory policies, and transportation system management. Although the framework has been developed particularly for China, it is generally applicable to other low-income countries in Asia.

Currently much is being said and written regarding the efficacy of granting federal, state and/or local operating subsidies. In this article, the author reviews the transit industry's peak capacity problem, and questions the economic wisdom of providing operating subsidies, as some are now being provided, and how most will probably be administered in the near future. An alternative plan suggests the manner in which subsidies can eventually help the transit industry. The article concludes with an analysis of what research efforts are needed in many urban transit systems and how subsidies can be used to support such research.

AB  - Current trends in public transportation have led to an increased interest in smart ticketing systems. Driven by a myriad of forcesincluding governmental privacy requirements and the desire organizations are seeking ways to offer better services, reduce operating expenses, increase ticketing efficiency, safety, reduce fraud, and maximize the opportunities for fare price discrimination. The resulting desire is for a ticketing system that allows for uninterrupted travel between Public Transportation Operators (PTOs), whether this be between cities or entire countries. Simply put, one ticketing system should allow for a seamless travel experience between geographies, allowing the traveler to have an uninterrupted door-to-door travel experience. But because traditional Electronic Fare Management systems have catered to the needs of each independent PTO, increasingly difficult to achieve mutual acceptance among it has become different PTOs. Accordingly, there are three options to accomplish this interoperability from the travelers perspective: on the card level, the application level, or the product level.

AB  - A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated -- the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction.
