AB  - Much of the current concern with sustainable transportation focuses on the alleged ills of the automotive industry. Global warming and a range of detrimental impacts are attributed to increased atmospheric concentrations of automotive emissions. Within Canada, various groups have attempted to achieve consensus on a variety of policies and measures intended to reduce automobile dependence. This paper is based on the premise that, from the standpoint of sustainability, the key goals for urban transportation involve first, reducing total vehicle-km of travel by altering both average trip lengths and modal split and, second, improving fuel efficiency by technological means. After examining the range of policy instruments available to achieve these goals, the highest priority policies are identified in terms of their likelihood of moving Canadian cities to more sustainable forms of land use and transportation development.

AB  - An interdisciplinary research program of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, has investigated the potential impact of substituting telecommunications and computer technology for certain forms of urban transportation [1]. Emphasis has been placed upon the use of these technologies to alleviate the massive twice-daily peak commuting loads imposed upon most major American cities. The primary means by which these technologies will be used is to allow "information industry" workers to perform their jobs at work centers scattered throughout each city, close to their homes, rather than commuting long distances to work. A basic premise is made that this reorientation of urban work patterns will not occur unless the technological substitutes can be shown to be both economical and effective. The results of a study of a major insurance firm located in the Los Angeles central business district are presented. The study evaluated the present transportation patterns, population distribution, and business contact requirements of a major administrative division of this firm. These commuting and communicating patterns were then used as the basis for assessing the feasibility of the use of various levels of telecommunications and computer technology for allowing the substitution for commuting by "telecommuting." Alternative telecommuting network designs were formulated and evaluated with respect to their ability to facilitate current work functions. Costs of network installation and operation were compared with the present costs of commuting. It is concluded that present communications and computer technology, in terms of "off-the-shelf" hardware and services, can offer an economical substitute for commuting.

Substantial spatial/temporal variations were observed in both the mass and number metrics of fine particles. Comparisons of exposure levels to fine particles across location categories reveals significant differences between particle mass and number concentration measurements; while the highest particle number concentration is on urban street sides, subway trains, with the lowest fine particle number concentration, has the second highest mass. Statistical analysis confirms this disparity. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the USA, there is a renewed effort towards ensuring that the design of transportation facilities enhances the cultural, social, historical, and of course, the natural environment. This shift in emphasis has been promoted in part by the ISTEA and TEA-21 acts of 1991 and 1998 and is reflected at the federal level by policy initiatives such as the recently published 'Flexibility in Highway Design from the FHWA. At the local level, an example of the new approach is seen in the increased use of traffic calming techniques as viable design solutions. "In this paper, we will evaluate the system of highway classification that is used in the USA and in Germany. Our goal is to develop guidelines concerning how the American system can be modified so that community livability issues are integrated in the overall approach to the system of highway design."

Throughout this chapter, we focus on analytic methods and findings that bear on current policy issues, and on the factual basis for policy analysis. We find that the most promising approaches in each case are narrowly targeted to solving market failures, such as the existence of externalities, and that these approaches are unlikely to alter the overall dominance of automobiles in urban passenger transportation.

Given a level and mix of funds, the model calculates the amount of highway and transit facilities, travel demand by mode, system performance, and external impacts such as fatalities, land consumed, air pollution, dislocations and energy consumed. The model was applied to assess the effects of alternative funding and pricing policies for the 64 largest urbanized areas.

AB  - The urban areas in Japan have undergone rapid changes in the last two and one-half decades. At the same time, the urban transportation system has been faced with numerous problems which need to be solved urgently. This paper presents the develop- ment stage and problems in the three largest metropolitan areas, designated as transport spheres, in Japan. Japan's problems in urban transportation are similar to those of most Western nations with regard to such issues as rapid urbanization, growth in travel, increasing auto ownership, growing transit operating deficits, rising wages and air pollu- tion. The differences are the large modal split of transit from automobile trips, major expansion of the rail transit network, and the large number of transit operators in each urban area in Japan. In addition, governmental policies to help solve the urban transport problems are briefly described. In order to make the policies effective, coordination among government agencies is required. The establishment of a unified government agency is regarded as the first priority in dealing with the urban transport problem. It is expected that the government will offer bold new countermeasures to cope with urban transportation problems.

AB  - Public housing is that housing which is owned and managed by public authorities. Its main role is to supply housing to unprivileged people. Public housing can be found in both capitalist and socialist countries, developed and developing countries. However, different countries have different public housing policies. Different policies have different effects in realizing government's housing objectives. America and China are two influential but different countries in the world. American is the biggest developed capitalist country and China is the biggest developing socialist country. America and China established public housing system in the 1930s and 1950s respectively. Both public housing systems have made significant progress but they also produced some problems after entering into the 1990s. This paper aims at making a comparative analysis of public housing policies in China and America, based on the experiences of Louisville and Jinan. It first reviews the history and current conditions of public housing in the two cities, then examines respective housing policies and policy reforms. After trying to find and explain policy differences between the two cities, some policy suggestions for future public housing are presented.

AB  - Dean’s Words Mohinder Singh Dean LTA Academy 2 012 has continued to see sustained effort in urban transport research, planning and development all over the world. We see evidence of this in the contributions to this issue of JOURNEYS, and even during some of the presentations made at the 3rd World Cities Summit held in Singapore in July this year. A highlight of the four day biennial event was the Flagship Urban Solutions Track (FUST) series of discussions which also explored the successes and challenges of various urban transport solutions. We are pleased to feature excerpts from one of those discussions, namely, Mobile Cities – In Search of New Urban Mobility Systems, here. Also, Dr Carlos Dora and Jamie Hosking, collaborating under the auspices of the World Health Organization, present an insightful review on the various ways urban transport directly and indirectly affects our overall health. Their findings are not confined to just physical health, but also examine other areas that have an impact on our well-being, including access to employment, education and recreation. From the portals of Demographia, a public policy firm in St Louis, USA, Wendell Cox questions the long-held and popular belief that lower density cities have longer average work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion compared to more compact cities. He puts forward several key evidence, arguments and analyses to show that the opposite is true – that higher urban densities are associated with longer work trip travel times and greater traffic congestion. London’s splendid showing during the 2012 Olympics is largely underscored by a well- planned public transportation strategy that ensured everyone arrived everywhere on time, with minimal disruption to the city’s daily business routine. The strategy leveraged on a Travel Demand Management programme christened Travel Advice for Business (TAB). Chris Hanley of Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM) was part of the team that delivered the TAB programme and shares exactly how it was done with a detailed account in this volume. Dr Wong Yiik Diew and Koh Puay Ping at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University provide a detailed examination of cycling mores in Singapore. They trace its evolution from an initially popular transport mode which was later relegated to being ‘the poor man’s transport’ and its current re-emergence as green transportation in an energy and environment conscious age. They also present the findings of a survey that revealed the preferences and behaviour of cyclists and pedestrians affected by them. The survey findings could be useful in directing and determining the future of cycling culture in Singapore. The Land Transport Authority’s Mageret Ely and AECOM’s Elaine Brick continue the discussion on the topic of cycling in the final article, but from a more global perspective. Focusing on the growing popularity and success of bike-sharing schemes in three cities, namely, Paris, New York and Copenhagen, they outline how strategic policy, network planning, education and awareness contribute to the growth of such programmes. The various authors for this volume have generously given their time and talent to help improve our understanding of so many areas in urban transportation development and planning, and helped us to have a new outlook to old issues. They have provided invaluable insight and simultaneously demonstrated how we can never assume that convention cannot be challenged and ingenious solutions are inconceivable. For that, I most surely thank them and trust you will find this volume an enjoyable read. Before signing off, I would like to give you a sneak peek at what JOURNEYS 2013 will hold. We shall be producing one bumper volume in 2013, as a commemorative issue for the upcoming inaugural LTA-UITP Singapore International Transport Congress and Exhibition (SITCE) 2013.

AB  - The disequilibrium between traffic supply and demand leads to unbalanced traffic flow in urban transportation networks. By analyzing the mutual influence between the traveler route selection and signal timing, a bi-level program model is proposed in order to optimize transportation network efficiency. In light of the similarity between the game theory and the bi-level program, some simple changes are made for the purpose of simplifying the computation of the problem. Finally, a practical network is designed to validate the bi-level program model. Results indicate that the model can improve road network efficiency and decrease vehicle delays. © 2009 ASCE.

AB  - The concepts of transport mode energy consumption and road network capacity are explained in the paper, which are applied to forecast the minimum energy consumption in a Meg polis. A bi-level optimization model is used, where upper-level establishes energy consumption consistent with the maximum road network capacity, while the lower level assigns traffic demand across the network. Modal split and the capacity models of vehicle roads are used to connect the two levels. The idea and method can be applied to the process of urban traffic planning so as to promote the sustainable development of urban transportation and environment. When traffic demand is more than traffic supply, transport structure can be adjusted according to the value of energy consumption by traffic modes.

In consequence of intensive lobbying campaigns by spokesmen for the elderly and handicapped, however, they have attracted rapidly increasing attention during the past several years. The paper proposes to identify three broad concepts of equity and some of their most significant reflections in current urban transportation policies and programs, briefly to examine the allocation of public mass transit expenditures as they relate to equity concerns, to review several approaches that have been taken to identifying transportation "needs" of the mobility-disadvantaged and to describe the state of current controversy about the most cost-effective ways to meet such "needs."

AB  - The traffic congestion has become the major drawback troubling sustainable development of Chinese cities. Considering the continuous increase on the traffic demand and limited road resources supply, how to operate the urban transportation system effectively is a severe challenge to the future development of urban transportation. The performance assessment of urban transportation system is a means to reflect the conflicts between the traffic demand and quality of traffic services offered by transportation network under the certain spatial and temporal circumstance. With the introduction of Intelligence Transportation System (ITS), using the traffic data with wide area coverage and establishing assessment model by taking the road network as analysis object, which is applied to analyze operating performance of urban traffic and its spatial-temporal characteristics, is of great significance to urban traffic planning, regional traffic control, traffic flow guidance system and improvement of urban traffic services. The research aims to explore the methodology of macroscopic performance measurement of urban road network. The studies are carried out by integrating the establishment of measures system of macroscopic assessment, the wide area detection system of traffic state and relative spatial data processing techniques, grade recognition model of network operating performance and analysis method of influencing factors to traffic condition. On the basis of the research meaning analysis on traffic performance measurement, road network is treated as the analysis objects for studying the macroscopic operating characteristics. The deficiencies of existing measures in the practical application are analyzed. On the basis of existing research and experimental studies, two-fluid model of macroscopic flow theory is used to establish an assessment measure system of macroscopic assessment. Macroscopic performance measures such as network congestion index (NCI) and network adaptability level (NAL) are proposed. Macroscopic assessment is based on traffic data with wide coverage over the transportation network. A simplified network data model based on GIS is defined considering the practicality of macroscopic performance measurement. The sampling interval is one of the key collecting strategies involved in the data collection, and the signal processing theory is applied to study the sampling interval of probe vehicle. The calculation model of sample size is studied by considering the non-uniform distribution of traffic flow density in the network. The methods for creating of route segment records, partitioning of microtrips based on vehicle route and determining of critical speed to identify vehicle state are explored systematically. The data processing scheme for massive probe vehicle data which includes the data diagnosis, digital map-matching, creation of macroscopic database and stoptime calculation is built. The processing program is programmed using JAVA language. The multi-index assessment method based on ideal interval is used to establish the grade recognition model for traffic performance. The k-means clustering method is employed to construct the ideal interval eigenvector, and a systematical and specific assessment standard for network performance measurement is developed based on the clustering results. The thresholds of each measure such as network congestion degree and adaptability level are defined. In order to determine the objective weights of different assessment indices, the projection pursuit model is used with RAGA (Real Accelerating Genetic Algorithm) optimization under MATALB environment. The assessment grade of each region is defined as the minimum one among the distances to all the standard assessment levels, and the reliable grade recognition model based on logistic curve is established. The assessment results are converted to the real numbers with consecutive meaning, which solves the problem of low resolution using general assessment method. The research clarified the relationship between the network features and the variation of quality of traffic services, and the influencing factors set is identified with the support of traffic engineering theory. On the basis of spatial correlation and convergence characteristic of regional traffic condition, the analysis method based on spatial autocorrelation is adopted to determine the spatial distribution of the grade of traffic condition and screen the correlative samples set of traffic performance. The spatial interpolation method of traffic performance grade for regional network is proposed as well. The analysis method of network feature influencing factors to traffic performance is established based on the partial least square (PLS) method, which solves the problems of small sample size and multivariate colinearity of independent variables. With the support of probe vehicle data, the paper establishes the assessment measures system of macroscopic performance measurement on urban street network. The projection pursuit-based grade recognition model of traffic performance and PLS-based influencing factor method of network features are presented respectively. The movement mechanism of traffic performance and spatial-temporal distribution of traffic congestion are investigated from the aspect of road network. The paper will be important reference for further researches in the field of traffic performance measurement on urban transportation network based on probe vehicle data.

AB  -  In this paper, we consider a real-time regulation problem of the traffic within a disturbed urban transportation network. From a given timetable, we aim to find a new schedule of various buses after detection of a disturbance at a given time. The main objective is to find a solution maximizing the level of service for all passengers by minimising their waiting times at stops and theirs transit times in connecting nodes. This problem was already studied with evolutionary approaches and multi-agents techniques without analyzing or identifying its type before. In this paper, we prove that the problem has an optimal solution in the case of illimited buses capacities and we propose a formulation which allows its resolution without requiring the use of metaheuristics. Numerical experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical formulation comparing it with evolutionary approaches.

AB  - This paper shows the similarity between transportation networks and thermodynamic systems. In particular, by regarding the vehicles as the energy stored in the system, it is demonstrated that transportation systems can have a similar notion of entropy. This transportation entropy is the measure of disorder and it is not only a suitable notion for evaluating the system performances, but also very useful for the control issue. With this in mind, by using dissipativity approach and choosing the entropy as storage function, a traffic signal control strategy is presented by means of Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI). This generation of dissipativity decreases the disorder and consequently renders the system better organized. Finally, a four-intersection system is studied in order to illustrate the performance of the results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper proposes a new specialized centrality measure to quantify the importance and the contribution amount of each street in an urban transportation network. Contrary to the previous general centrality measures (e.g., degree, betweenness, and closeness), this measure considers three important vehicular traffic characteristics: street capacity restrictions, the dominant pattern of travel demands, and the traffic-flow equilibrium. Applying the developed centrality measure to simulated networks shows that traffic flows more efficiently in urban networks with " small-world" configurations, where a certain number of shortcut links and locally clustered streets are allowed. However, with regular grid networks, the application of the proposed measure shows little efficiency. This outcome suggests that the regular grid is not suitable as a base structure in urban planning. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An aggregative economic approach to the theory of city size is presented along with some empirical findings which suggest that even the largest cities have not yet reached excessive sizes from the point of view of growth and productivity. Urban magnitude is no simple 1 dimensional phenomenon. Modern urban centers are surrounded by very large, diffuse zonal boundaries, within which there are marked variations in the proportion of firms and people associated with that center, and in the intensity of the association. In sum, population does not constitute a conventional, countable set. In general, population will be considered as the basic magnitude and as a conventionally definable number. Most approaches to city size have emphasized the presumed diseconomy of urban scale and have sought to establish that population at which costs per capita are least, regarding this as optimal. It is argued here that both the logic and the factual basis of this approach are faulty. The argument of minimum costs is insufficient in its own terms. Such an objective is reasonable only if output per capita is constant, but it appears that output per capita is an increasing function of urban size. In that case, a more sensible objective of public policy would deal with the relation of outputs and inputs, rather than only with inputs. In every country for which evidence was found, local product per capita (or some index for it, such as income or wages) rises with urban size, and where comparable figures on cost are available, these rise far more slowly if at all. Although all of the data desirable are not available for any single country, the overall pattern is clear. Possibly the most surprising element in the data is the marked decline with increasing density in Social Overhead Captial Stocks (SOCS) per capita. This runs counter to common belief that the bigger the city the more infrastructure per capita is needed and may be the result of such effects as the greater linear quantities of roads per capita necessary in low density areas. Since it appears that the biggest cities are not too big from the perspective of economic efficiency, it may be that higher average incomes of bigger cities do not mask sharper inequalities among their citizens, so that efficiency is gained at the cost of equity. This does not appear to be the case at least for the US. On the contrary, some studies indicate that there is less poverty and a more equal distribution of incomes in big cities than in smaller cities. There are some weak indications of a downturn in the product curve at the largest urban sizes, but even should the downturn be real, this would not be inconsistent with the efficiency of those larger sizes in a hierarchical system of cities.

AB  - Urban transportation is a complex phenomenon. Since many agents are constantly interacting in parallel, it is difficult to predict the future state of a transportation system. Because of this, optimization techniques tend to give obsolete solutions, as the problem changes before it can be optimized. An alternative lies in seeking adaptive solutions. This adaptation can be achieved with self-organization. In a self-organizing transportation system, the elements of the system follow local rules to achieve a global solution. Like this, when the problem changes the system can adapt by itself to the new configuration. In this chapter, I will review recent, current, and future work on self-organizing transportation systems. Self-organizing traffic lights have proven to improve traffic flow considerably over traditional methods. In public transportation systems, simple rules are being explored to prevent the "equal headway instability" phenomenon. The methods we have used can be also applied to other urban transportation systems and their generality is discussed.

AB  - Transportation and its environmental impacts are a major component of urban environmental management. At the same time, transportation and mobility are an important part of urban economics and the quality of life. To analyze urban transportation and its environmental impacts, a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach is needed. No single model can cover the range of spatial and temporal scales and processes involved. This leads to a multi-tiered approach and a cascade of models to describe alternative urban development and transportation scenarios and their multicriteria assessment and comparative analysis. This paper describes the methodology and application examples of Sustainable Urban Transportation (SUTRA) (http://www.ess.co.at/SUTRA/) a City of Tomorrow project under the European Union Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development Research Programme.

AB  - A framework is presented for evaluating the accessibility of urban networks to the transportation needs in urban areas. Accessibility has been defined from the point of view of the network configuration and its relationship to key factors influencing travel demand. The definition is a departure from the traditional methods of accessibility, which primarily describe the interaction of people and places. The definition in this study helps in assessing the interaction between the trip maker and the transportation network, thus helping in an evaluation of the utility of the network to trips in a study region. The methodology uses the computational capabilities of a geographic information system and relates them to the traditional urban transportation planning process. Specific indexes are presented to quantify the accessibility of the network with respect to key factors influencing trip production and attraction. The methodology presented is applicable to the analysis of accessibility of other transportation system networks and to comparisons of the accessibilities of networks of different urban areas.

AB  - The primary objective of the research project was to develop an interactive decision tool (SNAMUTS) to assist in examining scenarios for the future growth of the Perth metropolitan area in activity centres framed around the accessibility of the transport network and the accessibility of place. The SNAMUTS tool enables the quantification of the effect of transport infrastructure improvements and modifications, and of land use intensification, on the accessibility of activity centres and corridors by different modes of transport. The SNAMUTS tool provides an in-depth examination of the potential accessibility by public transport to all centres across the metropolitan area. Accessibility is measured using an impediment variable that factors in travel time, frequency of service and transfers. In this way accessibility is measured from the perspective of a traveller who also has the choice of car travel to any location within the metropolitan area. In order to provide that choice across multiple journey purposes the inter-peak period is measured. SNAMUTS applies seven different accessibility indicators. Most measure different properties of the public transport network, including speed competitiveness with car travel; one measures the accessibility of place in terms of numbers of residents and jobs within the public transport catchment. A composite indicator for overall public transport accessibility is then compiled drawing on these indicators. A total of five future scenarios were developed to assess different assumptions for priorities in public transport service and infrastructure improvements, and (in four of these five scenarios) for the spatial distribution of urban growth in metropolitan Perth: Frequency Boost (FRB) examines the effect on network performance that can potentially be achieved in the short term by increasing service levels across the network without (or with only minor) adaptations to the physical infrastructure. Correspondingly, this scenario makes no assumptions for urban growth but is based on the same population and job numbers, and their spatial distribution, as the Status Quo scenario. The service upgrades included in the Frequency Boost scenario also form part of each subsequent scenario. • Light Rail Corridors (LRC), like the three subsequent scenarios, anticipates a growth in residents and jobs across metropolitan Perth of 42 percent to a total of 2.6 million between 2006 and 2031. It is based on accommodating all of this growth in the immediate vicinity of a network of linear activity corridors in the inner and middle suburbs anchored by a new seven-route, predominantly street-running light rail system. The focus is on corridors with existing concentrations of medium- density living and a relatively fine-grained mix of land uses. To achieve this scenario a building density roughly equivalent to R80 or a pattern of three to four- story row houses or apartments would be required, and in the CBD and some adjacent areas a building density of R160, which is generally achieved in Australian cities by mixing mid-rise (three to six-storey) development with some taller structures. Similar densities and building typologies already prevail in some of these areas. • Middle Ring Centres (MRC) selects growth nodes in the middle suburbs to accommodate all growth, and accesses these centres by a mixture of orbital rail extensions, a new two-route rapid light rail system and improvements to strategic bus corridors. Urban growth in the 19 designated activity nodes in this scenario will require an average density of 208 residents and jobs per hectare within the 800- metre radius of each centre. This is roughly equivalent to a density zoning of R160 and can be achieved by a uniform build-out of six to eight-storey apartment and office buildings, or by a mixture of low-rise (three to four storeys) and high-rise. structures. Activity nodes of such a typology and configuration can be found, for example, in Bondi Junction or Chatswood in Sydney. The Middle Ring scenario further assumes that the residential density of central Perth and central Fremantle will increase to reach a minimum density of residents and jobs of 104 per hectare. Overall however, the spatial expansion of the growth centres is quite modest on a metropolitan scale, with only 6% of the currently urbanised area affected. • Fringe Expansion (FEX) accommodates all urban growth in Greenfield areas in Perth’s outer suburbs and services these by several rail extensions and new rail routes, as well as a better connected, cross-suburban bus system. All 800-metre catchments of new train stations will be zoned and planned to accommodate about 10,000 residents and jobs each, which equates to an average density of 50 residents and jobs per hectare. Bus corridors across growth areas outside these station precincts will aim to achieve a similar density within 400 metres of the route. • Composite Wishbone (CWB) is a combination of those elements of the previous three scenarios that have the greatest positive effect on network performance. It allows for urban growth to continue simultaneously in intensification areas along new light rail corridors, designated middle-ring growth centres as well as new transit-oriented settlement areas at the urban fringe. The Composite Wishbone scenario envisions all new urban development to be public transport-oriented, including in Greenfield areas, which cater for about 20% of total growth.

AB  - Existing optimal road-network capacity-expansion models are based on minimizing travel time and rarely consider environmental factors such as vehicular emissions. In this study we attempt to solve such a transportation network design problem when the planner is environment conscious and thereby tries to minimize health-damage cost due to vehicular emissions along with total system travel time while performing optimal capacity expansion. This problem can be formulated as a multiobjective optimization model which minimizes emissions in addition to travel time, and under budget constraints. A prerequisite for this model is an accurate estimation of vehicle emissions due to changes in link capacities. Since the current practice of estimation of vehicular emissions by aggregate emission factors does not account for the improved speeds resulting from capacity improvements, speed-dependent emission functions for various transport modes and pollutants are used in this study. These functions help in calculating emission factors for use in the proposed model. The model uses a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm as the optimization tool to solve the network design problem. The model is tested on a small hypothetical network and solved for a real large-sized network in India taking into account three pollutants and five transport modes. The Pareto-optimal solutions generated can act as trade-offs between total emissions and total system travel time to account for the planner's desired objectives. Also, reduction in travel time as well as in emissions supports the present model compared with the single-objective model.

AB  - This analysis examines an innovative approach to transportation policy in Curitiba, Brazil. Curitiba is a city of 1.6 million residents that has grown fourfold in the last 30 years. Unlike in many other cities, quality of life and transportation has not been a casualty of growth. Curitiba's transportation system actively helps residents obtain the benefits of growth, including access to jobs, homes, recreation, and other elements of the urban community. Curitiba's transportation planning process is practical. It recognizes financial and social constraints. Curitiba began with buses because it had buses. It began with a series of small improvements guided by a long-term plan. It first added a modest express route system with dedicated bus lanes. It sought out ways to improve and extend the system. The result is a surface system that provides the high-quality service of well-known underground systems at a much lower capital cost. These low costs mean that mass transit is entirely financed by passenger fares. The present system provides a range of benefits. The systematic approach to urban transportation has reduced travel times and increased convenience. Curitiba's buses now attract more passengers per operating kilometer than in any other Brazilian city. This intensive use occurs even though Curitiba also has one of the highest automobile ownership rates in Brazil. Rider surveys suggest that at least 20% of these new passengers previously used automobiles to commute. With less automobile congestion, the city has replaced several downtown streets with broad pedestrian malls and shopping areas. Reduced traffic appears to result in substantial fuel savings as well as reduced pollutant emissions. Calculations suggest that the reduction in automobile traffic saves 27 million liters of fuel/year. ?? 1995 International Energy Initiative, Inc.

AB  - This paper assesses governmental performance in its investment, provision and regulation of urban transportation. Attention is given to public bus and rail transit and road transportation. Evidence based on urban transport in US cities reveals substantial allocative and technical inefficiencies that have led to large public transit deficits and severe highway congestion.I argue that it is futile to expect public officials to remedy the situation by pursuing more efficient policies such as congestion pricing and weighing costs and benefits when deciding transit service. The problem is that urban transportation policy is largely shaped by entrenched political forces that inhibit constructive change. The only realistic way to improve the system is to shield it from those influences and expose it to market forces by privatising it. This position is supported by empirical evidence based on simulations for the US and the UK's early experience with privatisation.

AB  - ‘Network City’, the latest 25-year planning strategy for metropolitan Perth, Western Australia, is designed to realise the integration of land use and transport networks within established and new areas. This article examines the influence of urban form on travel patterns and the case for sustainable travel outcomes in order to set in context the ‘Network City’ concept. The concept is described, and then the article focuses on the operational detail needed to progress towards fuller integration between the transport network and the city it serves. This includes analysis of urban structure in the context of the factors that influence efficient use of public transport: including residential density, intensity of activity and the hierarchy of activity centres. The implications for road planning are discussed where land use–transport integration is the core objective rather than simply traffic efficiency. If sustainable travel is to be facilitated there is a need to change both the operation of public transport and the urban structure and these changes are mutually supportive.

AB  - Perhaps the most apparent transportation planning and urban development\nproblems that have over the years received attention of, and yet\ncontinue to pose challenges to policy makers, are the need to provide\nsustainable public transport system and revitalisation of distorted\nsocio-economic policies. The pressure created by rapid population growth\nof Lagos on transport infrastructure and services in the city is indeed\ngreat that decline in quality and quantity of services are inevitable\nand uncertain. The persistent trials and errors in the urban public\ntransportation policy resulted to the introduction of the three wheeler\nvehicular mode of public transportation in the metropolis of about 11\nmillion people.\nSince the vehicles hit the streets of Lagos about two years ago, many\nunder-employed graduates were put in business, many un-educated citizens\nincapacitated by poverty-stricken background got something to do, while\nshort-distanced commuters, who hitherto had made their trip on foot or\nmotorcycle had relief. These gains were, however, over shadowed by the\nrelatively small size of the vehicle (officially three passengers full\ncapacity) that made it uncomfortable for many passengers, its fragile\nnature inability to withstand the restlessness and aggressive nature of\nLagos commuters, emissions from within and other vehicles, engine noise\nfrom within and other vehicles continuously give passengers persistent\ndiscomfort. More importantly, the adoption of the mode for public\ntransport with its attendant limited occupancy restraint design put many\npassengers at risk and made the mode unsafe at any speed.\nThis paper examines the policy background of the introduction of this\nmode of public transportation in the most populated city in the African\ncontinent and discusses in details the transport-related pollution\nimplications of its use on the environment and the urban passengers and\npopulation. The overall concern of the government driven and dominant\ncontrol of public transportation systems in rapidly growing Nigerian\ncities is highlighted and the some policy suggestion advanced towards\nensuring a more effectively sustained public transport systems and urban\nenvironment.

AB  - The movement of people, goods, and information within the local metropolitan area is critically important to the functioning of cities. This chapter reviews the U.S. urban experience of the past two-centuries and traces a persistently strong relationship between the intraurban transportation system and the spatial form and organization of the metropolis. Following an overview of the cultural foundations of urbanism in the United States, the chapter then introduces a four-stage model of intrametropolitan transport eras and associated growth patterns. Within that framework, it becomes clear that a distinctive spatial structure dominated each stage of urban transportation development and that geographical re-organization swiftly followed the break-through in movement technology that launched the next era of metropolitan expansion. Finally, the chapter briefly considers the contemporary scene, both as an evolutionary composite of the past and as a dynamic arena where new forces ma already be forging a decidedly different future.

Firstly, the signal control of a network is modeled as a discrete-time state space model. It is found that the system is not completely controllable and hence, the system is decomposed into controllable subsystem and free one. To avoid congestion and reduce the impact of disturbance, H∞ control method is adapted and a traffic-responsive strategy under state and control constraints is constructed by means of Linear Matrix Inequality ({LMI).} Finally, a system including two intersections is studied in order to illustrate the result.

AB  - It has been recently shown that a macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) linking space-mean network flow, density and speed exists in the urban transportation networks under some conditions. An MFD is further well defined if the network is homogeneous with links of similar properties. This collective behavior concept can also be utilized to introduce simple control strategies to improve mobility in homogeneous city centers without the need for details in individual links. However many real urban transportation networks are heterogeneous with different levels of congestion. In order to study the existence of MFD and the feasibility of simple control strategies to improve network performance in heterogeneously congested networks, this paper focuses on the clustering of transportation networks based on the spatial features of congestion during a specific time period. Insights are provided on how to extend this framework in the dynamic case. The objectives of partitioning are to obtain (i) small variance of link densities within a cluster which increases the network flow for the same average density and (ii) spatial compactness of each cluster which makes feasible the application of perimeter control strategies. Therefore, a partitioning mechanism which consists of three consecutive algorithms, is designed to minimize the variance of link densities while maintaining the spatial compactness of the clusters. Firstly, an over segmenting of the network is provided by a sophisticated algorithm (Normalized Cut). Secondly, a merging algorithm is developed based on initial segmenting and a rough partitioning of the network is obtained. Finally, a boundary adjustment algorithm is designed to further improve the quality of partitioning by decreasing the variance of link densities while keeping the spatial compactness of the clusters. In addition, both density variance and shape smoothness metrics are introduced to identify the desired number of clusters and evaluate the partitioning results. These results show that both the objectives of small variance and spatial compactness can be achieved with this partitioning mechanism. A simulation in a real urban transportation network further demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method in effectiveness and robustness compared with other clustering algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Population density influences both travel patterns and land use configurations. Traditionally, density has been closely related to transportation systems - even today the impacts and intereffects are apparent. The concept of density best characterizes the change in urban structure that has taken place in the last several decades. Some of the pertinent interrelationships between population density and urban transportation requirements, on a city-to-city basis, and within given cities are analyzed. Density-travel analyses developed to date are reviewed. regional and historical effects on population density, distribution patterns of urban density, and density implications on total person and vehicular trip generation, car ownership, travel mode, transit patronage, and freeway impacts are analyzed.

AB  - Network capacity is one of the most important ways to measure the transportation system’s capacity to accommodate traffic demand. This paper presents an approach to estimate the capacity of urban transportation network considering more realistic traveler route choices. Different from previous studies, this research introduces a set of determinants that may reflect realistic traveler route choices including not only travel times but also traveler preferences (e.g., road familiarity, road configuration). This study formulates the route choice model with the new set of determinants and incorporates it into the network capacity model. An improved iterative assignment approach is designed to solve the network capacity model in which unrealistic detours by travelers will be eliminated. The proposed model and algorithm are applied in a test network; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under various levels of service, but also identifying critical links that are neglected by traditional approaches. Research findings offer guidelines for transportation agencies in preparing better and more pertinent management strategies to accommodate various traffic demand situations.

The City Beautiful aesthetic approach to conceiving urban circulation networks was an important and often overlooked contribution to transportation planning, and improving urban transportation was an important goal for City Beautiful reformers. A review of historical planning documents and project descriptions suggests that civic leaders' approaches to improving urban circulation during the City Beautiful era are enduring contributions of the movement's integrated approach to land use and transportation planning and its desire to transform cities into more beautiful places.

AB  - The network approach to urban studies can be differentiated from other approaches by its emphasis on the primacy of structures of interpersonal linkages, rather than on the classification of social units according to their individual characteristics. Network analysis is also a methodology for the investigation of these structures. Substantive issues related to interpersonal ties in the city, migration, resource allocation, neighborhood, and community are examined in terms of the network structures and processes that order and integrate urban activities. Finally, a view of the city itself as a network of networks is proposed. It is the organization of urban life by networks that makes the scale and diversity of the city a source of strength rather than of chaos, while it is precisely that scale and diversity which makes the existence of a complex and widely ramified network structure possible.

A systems approach for evaluating these simultaneously in order to formulate areawide passenger transportation energy policy is presented. It consists of a simple computer technique for estimating the conservation value of various schemes. The program is also of value in assessing the energy impact of individual energy conserving programs. Because only local planners are familiar with the economic, environmental, and political constraints on policy and programs, the tool is intended for use in urban regions. It is, however, written in general terms and as such, if used in all urban areas in the U.S., could offer realistic national estimates of urban passenger transportation energy requirements in the short term (0–10 yr).

AB  - Optimizing passengers and goods flows reduces the costs and ecological footprint of transportation systems, as well as congestion in cities. Since passengers and goods do not have the same nature (a person is active and a good is passive), modeling each flow separately seems natural. But local authorities need to consider passenger and freight transport together as a single logistic system. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of an existing transportation system where the spare capacity of public transport is used to distribute goods toward the city core. We propose two optimization approaches. The first one considers the problem as a multidepot VRPTW followed by an assignment problem. The second one solves the whole model as a pickup and delivery problem with transfers (PDPT). These approaches are evaluated on data sets generated following a field study in the medium-sized city of La Rochelle in France.

Considering the urban logistics system optimization, the authors proposed optimization methods for an urban road transportation network based on logistics system operation efficiency, and they put forward the Bi-level programming models to solve the multi-objective urban transportation network optimization question. We take the urban road transportation network programming question as the upper-level model, while taking the user equilibrium model for the single logistics activity route choice as the lower-level model.

AB  - When aligned with other services and facilities, transportation helps generate powerful forces for influencing the long-run real-estate market. Working to improve the productivity and livability of urban areas, officials are increasingly looking to metropolitan policy studies for effective action and regulation programs. Thus, beyond immediate considerations of access and congestion, transportation decisions are now expected to reflect the impacts of governmental programs on general urban development. The processes through which transportation decisions are made are themselves being modified in recognition of the broad reverberations of transport policy. With a wider array of persons and governmental units concerned with these decisions, the criteria applied to the alternative possibilities are becoming more comprehensive. Criteria applied depend not merely on personal outlook but also on the scope of responsibilities of the person weighing the alternatives. Two opposite tendencies are at work: a search for a reduction of criteria toward a single optimizing index accounting for all significant costs and benefits implicit in a proposed line of policy and program; conversely, a search better to identify and describe all the significant manifold repercussions of alternative proposals as these are viewed by different people.

AB  - It has been shown recently that a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) exists in urban transportation networks under certain conditions. However, MFD is not universally expected. Previous research demonstrates the existence of MFDs in homogeneous networks with similar link densities. More recent work focuses on the partitioning of a heterogeneous transportation network based on different congestion levels. A desired partitioning produces homogeneous regions with similar link densities to guarantee a well-defined MFD and spatially compact shapes to ease the implementation of control measurements [1]. Based on recently proposed partitioning mechanism, this paper further explores the spatial characteristics of sub-networks (sub-regions or clusters) in urban transportation networks. In this paper, a metric is defined to evaluate the spatial compactness of each cluster in the network. In order to obtain the metric, a fast graph traversal algorithm is proposed, which can produce a clockwise sequence for the spatially coordinated boundary nodes along a network. The algorithm takes O(n) and the effectiveness is proved and validated. By applying the boundary smoothness metric to our previous clustering results, we show that the spatial compactness is appropriately guaranteed for each region and the future control policies can therefore be easily implemented based on the partitioning and MFDs. The proposed algorithms can have more general applications in fields of network and graph theory.

AB  - Sustainable Development is the main force in urban planning today. It has developed as the alternative to the modernist philosophy. This modernist paradigm has left us with massive inequalities and inefficiencies in human landscapes and threatening ecological disasters. Sustainable Development on the other hand focuses on development rather than growth; it places human needs and equality before technology and efficiency. Sustainable Development with Sustainable Urban Transport are key solutions to our urban environmental, social and economic problems. Sustainable Urban Transport helps to improve our environment, health, quality of life, conserves our natural resources and is inline with the basic principles of Sustainable Development to bring about order, equality and sustainability in our society at all levels, the economy and environment. This report aims to highlight various challenges to Sustainable Development and Sustainable Transportation, both internationally and South African, and sheds a light on various policies and initiatives, proposed and in implementation, to achieve sustainability and efficiency in the Urban Transport System. The development of Transport Corridors together with Sustainable Public Transport is one of the many options we can investigate to ensure an efficient and Sustainable Urban Transport System.

AB  - Based on the model of network cities and by law of primate city and rank-size rule, we have analyzed the feature of the spatial structure system in Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations. The structure suggests that the network nodes of Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations are divided into five levels, and the cultivation direction is to develop the fourth node cities, such as Ningxiang, into the third-node cities, such as Xiangxiang, Liuyang, etc.. Then, we proposed the development scenarios of Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations network spatial structure system from node complement, channel optimization, nodes increase and city coordination. It's very meaningful for the model and scenarios to build and plan network spatial future models reasonably, and strengthen collaboration and the overall competitiveness in middle urban agglomerations.

AB  - The article addresses the various issues surrounding sustainable urban transportation as of 2004, using as reference the papers presented at the Postconference Workshop of the 9th Conference of the Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies in December 2004. A paper presented by M. Carey summarized some definitions of sustainability, with particular reference to transportation. The most commonly cited definition of sustainable transportation states that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. A study by Wang and Chan with regard to the mobility-impaired elderly indicate that the urban settlement pattern in Hong Kong is a moderating factor in increasing the accessibility of social services.

AB  - Several urban transportation systems are compared on the basis of the energy resources consumed in the manufacture of their vehicle and guideway systems and in their operation. Four systems, the auto, bus, rapid rail and personal rapid transit, are extensively analyzed, while the energy characteristics of dial-a-ride systems and the motorcycle are estimated. Analyses of bicycling and walking are also included for a comparison of motorized modes with human propulsion systems. For each system the energy required to manufacture a vehicle, the energy required to manufacture the guideway, and energy of operation are estimated. The average energy consumed per available seat-mile is calculated to compare the system when they are operating at capacity. An example containing assumed average occupancy levels gives a more realistic comparision on the basis of energy consumed per passenger-mile.

AB  - This paper proposes and studies new strategies for an increase of the energetic efficiency of an urban transportation network fed with catenaries. A simulation tool has been developed to determine the energy efficiency on the global transportation system (vehicles, feeding line and substations). The system energy consumption is identified by calculating the energy injected by the substations to the feeding line. It takes into account all the line losses and the interactions between the different vehicles on the line. The development of a new tool was necessary as other simulation tools calculate the energy consumption of the tram without taking in account the line properties and the interactions between the vehicles. Using this simulation tool, the energetic efficiency of a tram is studied while on board of the vehicle a supercapacitive energy storage has been added. The energy storage allows local energy recovery and injection of energy to the catenaries during braking phases. The results of simulations with or without on-board energy storage and with overhead lines with high resistive or standard behavior are presented. The results show that the global energy efficiency of the system (trams, feeding line and substations) is increased by a factor between 19.4 and 25.6 % (depending on the vehicle auxiliaries power) by adding a supercapacitive energy storage for both cases presented in this paper: high and standard line resistance. The use of a high line resistance instead of a standard line resistance increases the efficiency of the total system by an additional 5 %. Introduction

AB  - Cities play a vital role in promoting economic growth and prosperity. The develop- ment of cities largely depends upon their physical, social, and institutional infrastruc- ture. In this context, the importance of intraurban transportation is paramount. This article provides an overview of urban transport issues in India. Rather than covering every aspect of urban transportation, it primarily focuses on those areas that are important from a policy point of view. The article first reviews the trends of vehicular growth and availability of transport infrastructure in Indian cities. This is followed by a discussion on the nature and magnitude of urban transport problems such as congestion, pollution, and road accidents. Building on this background, the article proposes policy measures to improve urban transportation in India. Indian cities cannot afford to cater only to private cars and two-wheelers and there has to be a general recognition that policy should be designed in such a way that it reduces the need to travel by personalized modes and boosts public transport sys- tem. This requires both an increase in quantity as well as quality of public transport and effective use of demand as well as supply-side management measures. At the same time, people should be encouraged to walk and cycle and government should support investments that make cycling and walking safer.

AB  - The 1970s have been characterized by a growing sense of environmental, energy, and public revenue limits and by a continuing sharp decline in the national birth rate. Within the framework of these changing public concerns and priorities, debate on urban transportation policy has also shifted focus. There is less concern with large-scale highway and transit projects, and more with improved management and utilization of existing facilities. Further, the current acute sense of resource scarcity has increased interest in alternative means to allocate limited transportation funds to increase mobility as well as reduce dependence on imported oil, minimize pollution, aid job development, and increase the options of the elderly and the handicapped. The American political system has vitally important characteristics of a â€³conservativeâ€³ nature, but it is also highly attuned to dealing with the radical nature of modern reality. In reconciling these two orientations, American politicians are drawn inexorably to technological innovation as a path to problem-solving with minimal disruption of existing social arrangements and behavior patterns. Where technology is unable to do the job, the system often appears woefully ineffective. In dealing with at least some of the major problems of urban transportation, however, the system appears to be within a decade of achieving an unambiguous triumph.

AB  - In the development of methodology that can assist the decision-making process for reducing vehicle emissions in urban areas, the benefit of using geographic information systems (GIS) in enhancing the reliability of data is indeed significant. There are other positive features that could be used to enhance analyses and to prepare information in support of decision-making. These include: visualization of analysis results, improved communication with decision-makers, new analytical tools for testing transport technology innovations and investigating travel behaviour. This paper reports the methodological framework that is required for analysing the emission implications of measures that are intended to reduce vehicle emissions in urban transportation. A case study of the National Capital Region (NCR) Canada is used for illustration purposes. The overall framework for urban transportation planning, including emissions estimation, is introduced. The role of GIS is highlighted in terms of enhancing the reliability of data. Methodologies are noted that serve as an interface between travel analysis and emissions estimation. An emissions calculator is described that enables the estimation of air quality pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, results of selected scenarios are presented. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - North American cities have been evolving from monocentric to polycentric metropolitan regions, with multiple concentrations of activities occurring outside of traditional urban cores. This new urban structure, with multiple urban "activity centers," has profound influence on the functioning of cities, particularly transportation systems. This paper reviews the development of "activity center" definitions from various research fields, and concludes that the application of contemporary definitions to transportation analyses has significant weaknesses, particularly in analyzing suburban agglomerations of activities. An alternative method is suggested which incorporates not only the presence of concentrated employment, the traditional criteria, but also the trip-attracting strength of the employment types present in an activity center. The Philadelphia metropolitan area is analyzed using traditional definitions and the proposed methodology; several areas which would not be identified using traditional definitions meet the new criteria. The impact of these "transportation activity centers" on Philadelphia's travel patterns is explored.

The strengths and limitations of present static control technology and current computer traffic signal and freeway surveillance and control systems in urban areas are described. A taxonomy of possible information and control configurations in urban traffic operations is developed. The alternatives in the taxonomy are analysed and used as the basis for recommending specific real time information and control functions for improving, in an evolutionary manner, the performance of urban ground transportation systems. The recommended improvements would allow for the first time a meaningful substitution of operational control for physical (static) capacity increases in urban transportation.

AB  - This paper serves as an introduction to this special issue on new developments in urban transportation planning. The papers in this issue highlight how physical mobility is still an essential priority for urban life, but that there are associated costs in the terms of environmental impacts, quality of life and economic performance of cities. Four features of the emerging urban transportation field are identified. The first defining feature is that it is a discipline in the midst of a paradigmatic transition. Second is its overarching aim of achieving sustainable urban mobility as part of a broader effort towards enhancing quality of life in cities. The third feature is the emphasis on collaboration, integration and exchange with other professions and policy sectors. The last distinctive feature is the recognition that urban transportation planning is a communication-oriented activity.

AB  - In this paper, we identify three distinct paradoxical phenomena that can occur in congested urban transportation networks as regards the total emissions generated, which demonstrate that so-called 'improvements' to the transportation network may result in increases in total emissions generated. In particular, we illustrate, through specific examples, the following: (1) the addition of a road may result in an increase in total emissions with no change in travel demand, (2) the total emissions may increase with a decrease in travel demand and (3) the improvement of a road in terms of travel cost may result in an increase in total emissions without a change in the travel demand. These examples demonstrate that the network topology, cost structure, as well as the travel demand structure must be taken into consideration in any policy system aimed towards the reduction of emissions due to motor vehicles.

AB  - A theoretical planning model that consists of a composite set of modal networks for serving the population in an urban area or region is presented. By varying and controling various parameters in the model, an equilibrium of modal choices can be obtained by seeking the condition that no user can alter his path without experiencing an increase in cost. The equivalence between equilibrium conditions and a nonlinear programming problem will be established, following a fundamental theorem. Thus, under small perturbations in the composite network, either through changes in the frequency of certain trips or changes in the structure of the network, it is possible to linearize about the observed equilibrium to determine the effects of perturbations.

AB  - The transportation - urban form nexus lies at the heart of urban sustainability. Transportation provides the physical connectivity between people, firms and activities that permits economic and social interactions to occur. It also provides physical definition to urban areas in terms of the street system and our perceptions of how locations "connect" in space and time. And the accessibility to opportunities that it provides influences land development decisions and location choices of households and businesses. In particular, as urban areas continue to expand, automobile-dominated transportation systems both facilitate and promote inefficient "sprawl" that has ramifications for all elements of urban physical and social infrastructure (water, handling of wastes, schools, heath care, etc.) in addition to the transportation system per se. Urban form (i.e., the spatial distribution of people, businesses and other activities), in turn, fundamentally determines both travel demand and the cost-effectiveness of alternative forms of transportation. Most notably, public transit systems (as well as non-motorised modes of travel such as walking and bicycles) can only provide effective alternatives to the automobile if transit- and pedestrian-oriented urban forms are built. Transportation systems are major generators of greenhouse gases, air pollution and noise. They are also almost totally dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels as their source of energy. This paper sketches the broad dimensions of the modern urban transportation design problem, with emphasis on its connections with other elements of urban design, particularly the question of urban form. These dimensions include both physical infrastructure and services (roads, transit services, etc.) and the intelligent operational control of these facilities and services. Elements of a coordinated research program to address pressing short- and long-run urban transportation planning problems are then outlined.

AB  - China's population was 1.1 billion in 1990; it is expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2000. Its urban population was 33% in 1990 and is expected to grow to 47% by 2000. This enormous urban growth poses tremendous challenges to urban transportation planners. The five magacities-Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, and Wuhan-are planning for light rail transit/subway (LRT/MRT) systems that will cost $10 billion to $15 billion (U.S. dollars). However, China does not have the money and will depend on foreign aid and borrowing. Concurrently planners disagree about the appropriate role of motorized and nonmotorized transportation, especially the bicycle: some wish to abolish, restrict, or redirect it, and others wish to expand its systems role. The global LRT/MRT experience suggests that such systems are expensive and take a long time to build. Forecasting systems for cost and ridership are unreliable; actual costs are more than two or three times the forecast. The urban transportation trends and issues in China are discussed on the basis of a very diverse array of data research sources. The analysis includes mode splits, costs, and reliability functions, and their applicability to Chinese cities. It proposes a strategic planning framework for Chinese urban areas, focusing on optimum modal mixes, investment and regulatory policies, and transportation system management. Although the framework has been developed particularly for China, it is generally applicable to other low-income countries in Asia.

AB  - To meet the requirement of real-time vehicle navigation, a new path planning algorithm based on partitioned urban transportation network is proposed in this paper. The foundation of the algorithm is that an actual road network has its particular spatial distribution features, and GIS has strong visual editing functions for transportation network. According to the size of the transportation network, with the GIS platform SuperMap, we partition the network into a certain amount of rectangular blocks, and then according to the starting node and the destination node, the searching area of the algorithm is restricted reasonably. With the actual example given, the experimental results prove the high operational efficiency and strong practicality of the new algorithm.

AB  -  This paper deals with an Agent-based Model of a Decision-Support System for an Urban Transport Network. The present Multi-Agent Decision-Support System (MADSS) assists the regulator in the search of the appropriate regulation decisions in case of a bus traffic disturbance. It is composed of a Supervision Module and a Regulation Module that rely on the information given by the Automatic Vehicle Monitoring system (AVM). The supervision Module represents the temporal axis of the network by the agents of type BUS and the spatial axis by the agents STOP. These agents cooperate in order to detect as soon as possible the disturbances. The regulation Module contains the agents INCIDENT that identify the disturbances, the agents ZONEPERT that analyze them and the agents ZONEREG that generate regulation decisions via an anytime evolutionary approach. Hence, through the cooperative aspects of the agent interactions, the MADSS is able to perform a coherent and preventive regulation process.

AB  - Managing large, complex urban transportation systems involves numerous stakeholders because of decentralized ownership and operation of distinct pieces of the physical network and services. To deliver better service to users, many urban regions are adopting technological and operational solutions, both of which necessitate interaction among the decentralized organizations. This research applies systems engineering analysis techniques—design structure matrix and clustering—to improve efficiency and effectiveness of organizational interactions between agencies as they deploy intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and attempt to integrate their operations. Specifically, this paper examines the application of clustering to the institutional structure set forth by the regional ITS architecture for metropolitan Seattle, Washington. Clustering of Seattle area organizations noted previously unidentified multilateral relationships that offer potential for more efficient interagency interactions and, ultimately by extension, delivery of more effective transportation services to users
